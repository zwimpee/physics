# The Geometry of Information

*A journey through Witten's Physics 539, guided by neural networks and Socratic inquiry*

## The Central Mystery

Why does a black hole have entropy proportional to its *area* rather than its volume? Why does the formula

$$S = \frac{A}{4\hbar G}$$

look like it's counting degrees of freedom on a *boundary* rather than in the *bulk*?

Witten's course builds the mathematical machinery to confront this question. Along the way, we discover something startling: **spacetime geometry and quantum entanglement are two languages describing the same underlying reality.**

## Act I: The Grammar of Curved Spacetime

*Problem Set 1*

We begin with the Raychaudhuri equation — the statement that gravity focuses light. A congruence of geodesics, initially parallel, will converge under the influence of matter. The mathematics is the Ricci tensor $R_{\mu\nu}$, computed from the metric through Christoffel symbols.

**What we learned**: How to go from $g_{\mu\nu} \to \Gamma^\rho_{\mu\nu} \to R_{\mu\nu}$ by hand, then verified it computationally using neural networks trained on the Schwarzschild geometry. The network learned not just the metric, but its derivatives — the very quantities that encode curvature.

**The key insight**: Curvature is *local* information about how nearby geodesics accelerate toward or away from each other.

## Act II: Where Light Cannot Escape

*Problem Set 2*

Now we turn to *null* geodesics — the paths of light. The Raychaudhuri equation for null congruences tells us when light itself begins to converge inward. A **trapped surface** is one where even outward-pointing light rays are being focused inward by gravity.

Inside such a surface, escape is impossible. This is the mathematical definition of a black hole — not as a "place where gravity is strong" but as a *causal structure*: a region from which no signal can reach infinity.

**The horizon** is the boundary between escape and imprisonment. It is a null hypersurface generated by light rays that hover eternally, neither falling in nor escaping out.

**What we will compute**: The expansion scalar $\theta$ for null congruences in Schwarzschild spacetime. Where $\theta < 0$ in both directions, we have found a trapped surface.

## Act III: The Statistical Mechanics of Ignorance

*Problem Set 3*

A sharp turn: we leave curved spacetime and enter quantum mechanics. But not the Schrödinger equation — we study **density matrices**, the language for describing systems about which we have incomplete knowledge.

The von Neumann entropy $S = -\text{Tr}(\rho \log \rho)$ measures this ignorance. For a pure state, $S = 0$. For a maximally mixed state, $S = \log d$.

**Entanglement** creates a remarkable situation: a composite system AB can be in a pure state ($S_{AB} = 0$) while each subsystem is mixed ($S_A > 0$, $S_B > 0$). The entropy of a subsystem measures its entanglement with the rest.

**Strong subadditivity** — the constraint $S_{ABC} + S_B \leq S_{AB} + S_{BC}$ — is the deepest inequality in quantum information. It will turn out to constrain *geometry*.

## The Synthesis: Area = Entanglement

Here is where the three acts converge.

Consider a quantum field theory on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. Divide the boundary into regions A and B. The **entanglement entropy** $S_A$ measures the quantum correlations between A and B.

Ryu and Takayanagi discovered:

$$S_A = \frac{\text{Area}(\gamma_A)}{4 G_N}$$

where $\gamma_A$ is the minimal surface in the bulk that shares its boundary with region A.

This is not a metaphor. It is a precise mathematical identity. **Entanglement entropy IS area.** The geometry of the bulk spacetime is *encoded* in the entanglement structure of the boundary quantum state.

The black hole entropy formula is a special case: the horizon is the minimal surface, and its area counts the entanglement between the interior and exterior.

## The Computational Thread

Throughout this journey, we use **EinFields** — a neural network framework for differential geometry:

- Train networks to learn metrics from coordinate data
- Compute curvature tensors via automatic differentiation  
- Verify analytical calculations against numerical output
- Eventually: learn bulk geometry from boundary entanglement data

The trained Schwarzschild model lives at `/workspaces/EinFields/runs/rx4yd4cv`, supervised on metric, Jacobian, and Hessian to ensure accurate curvature.

## The Converse: Geometry for Optimization

We pursue a bidirectional relationship:

**Forward**: Deep learning → Understanding spacetime  
**Converse**: Spacetime mathematics → Improving deep learning

The loss landscape of a neural network *is* a curved space. The parameters $\theta$ live on a manifold. Gradient descent attempts to descend this landscape, but it treats the space as flat — it follows coordinate directions, not geodesics.

**The intuition**: Just as a particle in curved spacetime follows geodesics (paths of least action), perhaps optimal learning follows geodesics in parameter space. The Hessian of the loss is the curvature. Christoffel symbols would tell us how to *correct* the naive gradient to account for this curvature.

**Known connections to watch for**:

- *Natural gradient descent*: Uses Fisher information metric $g_{ij} = \mathbb{E}[\partial_i \log p \cdot \partial_j \log p]$ as a Riemannian metric on parameter space
- *Information geometry*: The space of probability distributions is curved; KL divergence induces a metric
- *Geodesic optimization*: Following shortest paths in parameter space, not coordinate directions
- *Ricci flow*: Could smoothing the loss landscape via geometric flow improve trainability?

**Open questions we're hunting for**:

1. Can Christoffel symbols of the loss landscape correct gradient descent?
2. Does the Raychaudhuri equation say something about when optimization "focuses" toward minima vs. diverges?
3. Is there a notion of "trapped surface" in optimization — regions from which SGD cannot escape?
4. Could entanglement entropy measure correlations between layers in a meaningful way?

We remain alert for clues as we work through the physics. When intuition crystallizes, we test on toy models.

## Clinical Trajectory Geometry

A parallel thread: applying this framework to **healthcare**.

The space of patient states is high-dimensional: vital signs, lab values, diagnoses, treatments, outcomes. A hospital encounter traces a trajectory through this space.

| Spacetime Concept | Clinical Analog |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Point in manifold | Patient state at time t |
| Metric tensor | Similarity structure on patient states |
| Geodesic | Optimal clinical trajectory |
| Curvature | How nearby trajectories converge/diverge |
| Trapped surface | Clinical states from which poor outcomes are inevitable |
| Horizon | Boundary of recoverability |

The Raychaudhuri equation would describe when patient trajectories *focus* — when clinical interventions successfully redirect patients toward recovery, or when deterioration becomes self-reinforcing.

This is speculative but mathematically grounded. The same framework that describes black hole formation might describe clinical deterioration.

## Where We Stand

**Completed**: Act I (Raychaudhuri, $R_{tt}$) — derived by hand, verified with EinFields

**Current**: Act II (null hypersurfaces, trapped surfaces, horizons) — AI-generated solutions exist as scaffolding; next step is human derivation + computational verification

**Ahead**: Act III (quantum information) — AI-generated solutions exist; will follow Act II through the same derivation→verification cycle

**Parallel track**: Connecting each act's mathematical insights to deep learning optimization as we go

The path forward is clear. The destination is profound: understanding how spacetime itself might emerge from quantum information — and whether these insights can flow backward to improve how machines learn.
