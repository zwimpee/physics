## Learning Goals

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

1. **Explain why locality matters**: Why do we want field theories where interactions happen at a point?

2. **Write field Lagrangians**: Given a physical situation, write down $\mathcal{L}(\phi, \partial_\mu \phi)$

3. **Derive field equations**: Use the Euler-Lagrange equation to get equations of motion

4. **Apply Noether's theorem**: Given a symmetry transformation, find the conserved current

5. **Compute the stress-energy tensor**: From spacetime translation invariance

## What to Watch

### Lecture 1: Classical Field Theories and Principle of Locality

**Location**: `../../8.323-spring-2023/resources/`

**Key points to catch**:
- Why fields? Why not action-at-a-distance?
- What does "locality" mean mathematically?
- The transition from particle Lagrangians to field Lagrangians
- Examples: scalar field, electromagnetic field

**Take notes on**:
- The form of a general local Lagrangian density
- Why higher derivatives are problematic
- The relativistic notation $\partial_\mu \phi$

### Lecture 2: Symmetries and Conservation Laws

**Location**: `../../8.323-spring-2023/resources/`

**Key points to catch**:
- Noether's theorem: symmetries ↔ conservation laws
- How to derive conserved currents
- The stress-energy tensor from translation invariance
- Internal symmetries (like phase rotations)

**Take notes on**:
- The general formula for Noether currents
- Examples worked in lecture

## What to Read

See [readings.md](./readings.md) for a detailed guide with page numbers.

**Short version**:
1. **[P&S] Section 2.1**: The Klein-Gordon field — setting up the problem
2. **[P&S] Section 2.2**: The Klein-Gordon field — canonical quantization (skim for now, focus on classical part)
3. **[Tong] Chapter 1**: Classical Field Theory — excellent pedagogical treatment

## Suggested Workflow

### Session 1: Lecture 1 + Initial Reading (2-3 hrs)

1. Watch Lecture 1 with the transcript handy
2. Pause and take notes at key derivations
3. Read P&S 2.1 (up to quantization)

### Session 2: Lecture 2 + Noether (2-3 hrs)

1. Watch Lecture 2
2. Read Tong Chapter 1 (especially on Noether's theorem)
3. Work through the Noether examples

### Session 3: Socratic Guide (30 min - 1 hr)

1. Close all books/notes
2. Work through [socratic_guide.md](./socratic_guide.md)
3. Check your answers, note what's shaky

### Session 4: Problem Set (3-4 hrs)

1. Open the problem set: [mit8_323_s23_pset01.pdf](../../8.323-spring-2023/static_resources/mit8_323_s23_pset01.pdf)
2. Work problems in [ps01_attempt.md](./ps01_attempt.md)
3. **Don't look at solutions yet!**

### Session 5: Review & Write-up (1 hr)

1. Compare with official solutions: [mit8_323_s23_pset_01sol.pdf](../../8.323-spring-2023/static_resources/mit8_323_s23_pset_01sol.pdf)
2. Write clean solutions in [ps01_solutions.md](./ps01_solutions.md)
3. Note what you got wrong and why

## Problem Set 1 Overview

**Location**: [mit8_323_s23_pset01.pdf](../../8.323-spring-2023/static_resources/mit8_323_s23_pset01.pdf)

The problems typically cover:
- Deriving field equations from Lagrangians
- Computing Noether currents
- The stress-energy tensor
- Specific examples (Klein-Gordon, Maxwell)

Work these **before** looking at the solutions.

## Connections to Other Material

### From Witten's Course

You've seen Lagrangians in the context of gravity. The Einstein-Hilbert action $S = \int R \sqrt{-g} \, d^4x$ is a field Lagrangian for the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$.

### Toward Path Integrals

The classical action $S[\phi]$ will become central when we quantize using path integrals: the amplitude is $\sim e^{iS[\phi]/\hbar}$ summed over all field configurations.
