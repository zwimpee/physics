# Week 2: Canonical Quantization (PS2)

*Quantizing the free scalar field*

---

## Coming Soon

Complete Week 1 first, then this scaffolding will be expanded.

---

## Preview

**Lectures**: 3-4 (Why Quantum Field Theory, Canonical Quantization of Free Scalar Field)

**Readings**: P&S Chapter 2 (quantization sections), Tong Chapter 2

**Topics**:
- The free scalar field as a collection of harmonic oscillators
- Creation and annihilation operators $a_k^\dagger$, $a_k$
- The vacuum state and particle interpretation
- Propagators and Green functions

**Key insight**: A free quantum field is an infinite collection of quantum harmonic oscillators, one for each momentum mode.
