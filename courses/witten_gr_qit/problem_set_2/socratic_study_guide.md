# Foundational Concepts: Expansion and Focusing

Before tackling the problems, we need to understand the physical concepts that underpin Problem Set 2.

## Concept 1: The Expansion Scalar θ

### What is Expansion?

The **expansion** θ measures how fast the cross-sectional area of a bundle of geodesics is changing.

**Picture:** Imagine a family of curves (geodesics) flowing through spacetime:

```
Spreading apart (θ > 0):     Converging (θ < 0):
      /    |    \                \      |      /
     /     |     \                \     |     /
    /      |      \                \    |    /
```

| θ | What's happening | Physical meaning |
|---|------------------|------------------|
| θ > 0 | Geodesics spreading apart | Expansion |
| θ = 0 | Geodesics maintaining separation | Steady flow |
| θ < 0 | Geodesics converging | Focusing |

> Q: In flat spacetime (no gravity), a family of initially parallel light rays will: (a) stay parallel, (b) converge, or (c) diverge?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**(a) Stay parallel.** 

In the absence of gravity, there's nothing to focus or defocus the rays. θ remains constant (typically zero for parallel rays).
</details>

---

**Check Your Understanding:**
> Q: In the presence of matter (curved spacetime), what happens to those light rays?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**They converge (focus).**

Gravity is attractive, which means it causes geodesics to focus. The expansion θ decreases, eventually becoming negative.

This is the physical content of **Raychaudhuri's equation**: gravity causes focusing.
</details>

---

## Concept 2: Raychaudhuri's Equation

From Problem Set 1, we derived:

```
R_tt = -∂_t θ - θ² - (shear terms)
```

where θ = ½ Tr(g⁻¹ġ) for timelike geodesics.

**Physical meaning:**
- If R_tt > 0 (positive energy), then θ decreases over time
- Once θ becomes negative (focusing), the θ² term accelerates the focusing
- This leads to θ → -∞ in finite time: a **caustic** or **singularity**

---

**Check Your Understanding:**
> Q: If θ starts positive and keeps decreasing due to gravity, what physically happens when θ → -∞?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**The geodesics converge to a point — they become trapped.**

All the curves in the bundle meet at a single point. This is a caustic. If you're inside such a region, you cannot escape — the geometry itself is focusing everything inward.

This is the mathematical basis for **trapped surfaces** and the **singularity theorems**.
</details>

---

## Concept 3: Trapped Surfaces (Preview of Problem 2.2)

A **trapped surface** is a 2D surface where BOTH inward and outward-pointing light rays have negative expansion:

| Direction | Normal expansion | Trapped surface |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Outward light | θ_out > 0 (spreads) | θ_out < 0 (converges!) |
| Inward light | θ_in < 0 (converges) | θ_in < 0 (converges) |

```
Normal sphere:              Trapped surface:
   ← • →  (outward spreads)    → • ←  (ALL light converges)
```

**Physical meaning:** Inside a black hole's event horizon, even outward-pointing light is being dragged inward by the geometry. You're on a trapped surface.

# Null Coordinates

## Why Null Coordinates?

Problem Set 2 studies **null hypersurfaces** — surfaces generated by light rays (like event horizons). To study these, we use coordinates adapted to light:

| Coordinate type | Adapted to |
|-----------------|------------|
| (t, x) | Timelike observers |
| (u, v) | Light rays (null geodesics) |

---

## Definition of Null Coordinates

Starting from Minkowski spacetime with ds² = -dt² + dx²:

```
u = t - x    (labels right-moving light rays)
v = t + x    (labels left-moving light rays)
```

**Inverse transformation:**
```
t = (u + v)/2
x = (v - u)/2
```

---

**Check Your Understanding:**
> Q: For a right-moving light ray (dx/dt = +1), what happens to u along that ray?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**u is constant along a right-moving ray.**

For a right-moving ray: dx = dt, so:
```
du = dt - dx = dt - dt = 0
```

The coordinate u doesn't change as you move along the ray. Each right-moving light ray is labeled by a constant value of u.
</details>

---

**Check Your Understanding:**
> Q: In (t, x) coordinates, light rays are at ±45°. What angles are they at in (u, v) coordinates?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

**0° and 90° — light rays become horizontal and vertical!**

- Right-moving light: u = constant → vertical lines in (u, v) plane
- Left-moving light: v = constant → horizontal lines in (u, v) plane

The null structure becomes manifest in these coordinates.
</details>

## Derivation: The Metric in Null Coordinates

### Step 1: Compute the differentials

From t = (u + v)/2 and x = (v - u)/2:

```
dt = (∂t/∂u)du + (∂t/∂v)dv = (1/2)du + (1/2)dv

dx = (∂x/∂u)du + (∂x/∂v)dv = (-1/2)du + (1/2)dv
```

---

### Step 2: Substitute into ds²

```
ds² = -dt² + dx²
```

**Squaring the differentials:**
```
dt² = [(1/2)du + (1/2)dv]² = (1/4)du² + (1/2)dudv + (1/4)dv²

dx² = [(-1/2)du + (1/2)dv]² = (1/4)du² - (1/2)dudv + (1/4)dv²
```

**Substituting:**
```
ds² = -[(1/4)du² + (1/2)dudv + (1/4)dv²] + [(1/4)du² - (1/2)dudv + (1/4)dv²]

    = (-1/4 + 1/4)du² + (-1/2 - 1/2)dudv + (-1/4 + 1/4)dv²
    
    = -dudv
```

---

### Step 3: Extract the metric tensor

The line element ds² = g_μν dx^μ dx^ν expands as:

```
ds² = g_uu du² + 2g_uv dudv + g_vv dv²
```

Comparing with ds² = -dudv = 0·du² + (-1)·dudv + 0·dv²:

| Coefficient | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| g_uu | 0 |
| g_vv | 0 |
| 2g_uv | -1, so g_uv = **-1/2** |

**The metric matrix:**
```
g_μν = [  0    -1/2 ]
       [ -1/2   0   ]
```

---

**Check Your Understanding:**
> Q: Why is the metric purely off-diagonal in null coordinates?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Because the coordinates are aligned with light rays!

- Moving in the pure u-direction (dv = 0): ds² = 0 (null)
- Moving in the pure v-direction (du = 0): ds² = 0 (null)
- Only combinations of du and dv give non-zero ds²

The diagonal being zero means the coordinate directions themselves are null (light-like).
</details>

---

### Step 4: Compute the inverse metric

For Christoffel symbols and curvature, we need g^μν.

**Using the 2×2 inverse formula:**

For [[a, b], [c, d]]: inverse = (1/det) × [[d, -b], [-c, a]]

```
det(g) = (0)(0) - (-1/2)(-1/2) = -1/4

g^μν = (1/(-1/4)) × [[0, -(-1/2)], [-(-1/2), 0]]
     = -4 × [[0, 1/2], [1/2, 0]]
     = [[0, -2], [-2, 0]]
```

**The inverse metric:**
```
g^μν = [  0   -2 ]
       [ -2    0 ]
```

---

**Check Your Understanding:**
> Q: Verify that g_μν × g^μν = I (the identity matrix).

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

```
[[0, -1/2], [-1/2, 0]] × [[0, -2], [-2, 0]]

= [[(0)(0) + (-1/2)(-2), (0)(-2) + (-1/2)(0)],
   [(-1/2)(0) + (0)(-2), (-1/2)(-2) + (0)(0)]]

= [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  ✓
```
</details>

# Problem 2.1: Computing R_uu (Preview)

## Problem Statement

In class, we discussed the metric near a null hypersurface:

```
ds² = -2e^q dv du + g_AB(dx^A + c^A dv)(dx^B + c^B dv)
```

where:
- q, g_AB, c^A depend on coordinates (u, v, x^A)
- At v = 0, q is independent of u
- The surface v = 0 is a null hypersurface Y

**Goal:** Calculate R_uu along Y (at v = 0). This gives Raychaudhuri's equation for null geodesics.

## Connection to What We've Learned

| PS1 (Timelike) | PS2 (Null) |
|----------------|------------|
| Metric: ds² = -dt² + g_ij dx^i dx^j | Metric: ds² = -2e^q dv du + ... |
| Computed R_tt | Will compute R_uu |
| Expansion θ for massive particles | Expansion θ for light rays |
| Raychaudhuri for timelike geodesics | Raychaudhuri for null geodesics |

1. Understand the general null hypersurface metric
2. Compute Christoffel symbols in null coordinates
3. Derive R_uu

# Appendix: Key Formulas

**Null coordinate transformation:**
```
u = t - x,  v = t + x
t = (u + v)/2,  x = (v - u)/2
```

**Flat metric in null coordinates:**
```
ds² = -du dv

g_μν = [  0    -1/2 ]      g^μν = [  0   -2 ]
       [ -1/2   0   ]             [ -2    0 ]
```

**Expansion (timelike geodesics):**
```
θ = ½ Tr(g⁻¹ġ)
```

**Raychaudhuri equation (schematic):**

dθ/dτ = -θ²/(d-1) - σ² + ω² - R_μν u^μ u^ν
```

where σ is shear, ω is vorticity, u is the tangent vector to geodesics.
