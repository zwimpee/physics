[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.345 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: OK, let us start.

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:15.510 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:24.090 align:middle line:84%
So, last time, we discussed how
to calculate such a correlation

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:47.990 align:middle line:84%
function, say Gn, in a
single particle theory,

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.540 align:middle line:90%
so using path integral.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So the goal is to calculate
this time-ordered product

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.360 align:middle line:84%
correlation function, the
vacuum correlation function,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.110 align:middle line:84%
of this time-ordered
product in this theory.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:84%
So, last time, we described how
to do this using path integral.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And we derive the
beautiful formula.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.620 align:middle line:84%
So the formula is
given by the following.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:26.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a Gn is given by the ratio
of two path integrals DX(t).

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.425 align:middle line:84%
So if we call this
thing to be x.

00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:34.220 align:middle line:90%


00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.747 align:middle line:84%
So the x and the
exponential i S xt.

00:01:39.747 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And then, the DX(t), just
the pure path integral.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.920 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So, here, I didn't write to the
upper limit and lower limit.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.980 align:middle line:84%
So it should be understood
that the boundary

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.210 align:middle line:84%
condition for both path
integral is that the x--

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:84%
So it should be from
minus infinity--

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.039 align:middle line:84%
the time range should
be from minus infinity

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.350 align:middle line:90%
to plus infinity.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And then we can choose the
value of x at both ends just

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.220 align:middle line:90%
to be zero.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, and the
slight subtlety

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.020 align:middle line:84%
is that, when you
evaluate S, so there

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.760 align:middle line:84%
should be the epsilon
parameter because we--

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.040 align:middle line:84%
in deriving the path
integral we have,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.170 align:middle line:84%
say we need to give the
Hamiltonian a slightly

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.970 align:middle line:90%
say epsilon part.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.320 align:middle line:84%
So that will also
affect your action.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.180 align:middle line:84%
So your action will also have
a small epsilon dependence.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And so, at the end
of the day, after you

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.030 align:middle line:84%
have done this
calculation, and then

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.280 align:middle line:90%
you said epsilon goes to 0.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.000 align:middle line:84%
So the epsilon goes to
0 at the end of here.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.680 align:middle line:84%
So when we write
the epsilon, it's

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.970 align:middle line:84%
always should be assumed that
this is a positive number.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.850 align:middle line:84%
This is infinitesimal
positive number.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.080 align:middle line:90%


00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.630 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.595 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:26.150 align:middle line:90%


00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So, now, in principle,
with this formula,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.500 align:middle line:84%
then we can now
calculate this quantity.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.090 align:middle line:90%
We can calculate this quantity.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And we can calculate
this n-point function.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.700 align:middle line:84%
So, but, in practice, it's
actually more convenient,

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:84%
rather than to calculate
the Gn, because we often

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.580 align:middle line:84%
need to know the
such correlation

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.650 align:middle line:90%
function for different n.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.338 align:middle line:84%
We often need to
know such correlation

00:03:53.338 --> 00:03:54.380 align:middle line:90%
function for different n.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So not only say sometimes we
are interested in n equal to 2,

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.720 align:middle line:84%
sometimes interested in n
equal to 3, 4, et cetera.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And then, there is
a nice trick to--

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.700 align:middle line:84%
you can try to
calculate, then say,

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.770 align:middle line:84%
in general, is to use this
technique called generating

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:23.710 align:middle line:84%
functional, which
we started talking

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.240 align:middle line:84%
about at the end
of last lecture.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And so, the basic idea of
the generating functional

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.890 align:middle line:84%
can be easily understood
by consider just

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.800 align:middle line:90%
this one-dimensional example.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Say, if you are interested in
doing an integral like this,

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.090 align:middle line:90%
xn.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And, if you are interested
in this integral

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.840 align:middle line:84%
for different
value of integer n,

00:04:52.840 --> 00:05:00.970 align:middle line:84%
then it's more convenient to
consider such an integral, Za

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.225 align:middle line:90%
given by--

00:05:02.225 --> 00:05:08.640 align:middle line:90%


00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.220 align:middle line:84%
So the reason I put
the i here is just,

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.130 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I didn't specify
the range of x.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And if x is from minus
infinity to plus infinity,

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.900 align:middle line:90%
it's not easy to-- yeah.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.457 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, put i here, just so that
this integral can be defined.

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Depending on circumstances,
you don't have to put the i.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Say if x is from 0
to infinity, then

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.170 align:middle line:84%
I can just put, say, minus
lambda a, with lambda

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.790 align:middle line:90%
to be a positive number.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:37.860 align:middle line:90%
And then, that's fine.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.520 align:middle line:90%


00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.370 align:middle line:84%
So the benefit of considering
this integral is that-- oh, no,

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.670 align:middle line:84%
no, no, not the--
sorry, I should--

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.570 align:middle line:90%
x, yeah, xa.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.580 align:middle line:90%


00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.753 align:middle line:84%
So the benefit of
doing this integral

00:05:58.753 --> 00:06:00.170 align:middle line:84%
is that if you
notice, say, if you

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.435 align:middle line:84%
take a derivative
with respect to a,

00:06:02.435 --> 00:06:05.060 align:middle line:84%
and then, that will
bring down a factor of x.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:12.305 align:middle line:84%
So it's a-- so if you
take a derivative with a,

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:14.630 align:middle line:84%
you bring down a
factor of x, and you

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.290 align:middle line:84%
take the derivative
twice with a,

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.830 align:middle line:84%
then you bring down
a factor of x square.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you do it n times,
and then you bring down

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.910 align:middle line:90%
a factor of x to the power n.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.720 align:middle line:84%
So, essentially,
this Zn then can

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:37.500 align:middle line:84%
be written as partial n Za,
then partial a, you derivative n

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.280 align:middle line:90%
times.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And then you set a equal to 0
because, in the end, we want--

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.600 align:middle line:84%
in this integral, there's
no exponential piece.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And you set that
equal to 0, then

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.612 align:middle line:84%
you get rid of the
exponential piece.

00:06:48.612 --> 00:06:50.250 align:middle line:90%
Then you have factor of xn.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.690 align:middle line:90%
So there's still-- yeah.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.520 align:middle line:90%
So I still need to put i n here.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.390 align:middle line:84%
So if you know how to
compute the Za, and then

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.050 align:middle line:84%
you only need to take
derivatives to do Zn.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.840 align:middle line:84%
So taking derivatives is much
easier than doing integrals.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.840 align:middle line:84%
So, in other words,
we can also write it,

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.570 align:middle line:84%
expand Za in terms
of power series in a.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And then, the Zn would
be the coefficient.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.940 align:middle line:90%


00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.350 align:middle line:84%
So Zn would be the coefficient
for a to the power n.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:37.500 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.470 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.145 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so we call this Za
the generating function.

00:07:43.145 --> 00:07:51.030 align:middle line:90%


00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.700 align:middle line:84%
So now we can use
the similar idea

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.870 align:middle line:90%
to generalize to this case.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And, now, here, this
is-- here it's just

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.920 align:middle line:90%
one-dimensional integral.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Here we have a
functional integral.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.860 align:middle line:90%
So now this is the function.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.640 align:middle line:84%
So, essentially, you just
generalize this generating

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.970 align:middle line:84%
function into a
generating functional.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And so, we can consider
the following object.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.510 align:middle line:84%
So in order to
compute this, then

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:25.330 align:middle line:84%
we can consider
the analog of this

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:31.330 align:middle line:84%
a is we consider object called
J. J now will depend on t.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, J is a function.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:39.250 align:middle line:84%
J is a function because
x now becomes a function.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And so, introduce a
path integral like this.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.480 align:middle line:90%
So, from now on, I will not--

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.660 align:middle line:84%
when I don't write the
range, then it's always--

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.490 align:middle line:84%
you should always
keep this in mind--

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:53.800 align:middle line:84%
the range will always
from minus infinity

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.890 align:middle line:84%
to plus infinity with the
boundary value to be 0.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:00.200 align:middle line:90%


00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And then, we can just
say, I have standard xt.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Then I can add the
analog of this.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:16.880 align:middle line:84%
So, remember, again, you
think t is just an index.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And then you just, essentially,
imagine if you have multiple x.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.660 align:middle line:90%
And then you just sum over them.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.240 align:middle line:84%
So sum over them, in this
case, just corresponding

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.720 align:middle line:90%
to an integral.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And so, we just have
a piece like this.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.760 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.410 align:middle line:84%
So this would be
the generalization

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:36.800 align:middle line:90%
of that equation.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And so, integration over t
just can be imagined as a sum.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if you have
multiple x and multiple a,

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.260 align:middle line:84%
and then you need
to sum over them.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And then, yeah, so this is
just a generalization of that.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.285 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
questions on this?

00:09:52.285 --> 00:09:57.010 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:03.350 align:middle line:84%
So now, similarly, now if we
take a functional derivative

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:09.740 align:middle line:84%
with respect to Jt, then we
can bring down a factor of xt.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.950 align:middle line:84%
So, more explicitly, so
let me just remind you,

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:16.730 align:middle line:84%
that the rule of doing
functional derivative.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:25.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a function,
delta Jt prime, with respect

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.920 align:middle line:84%
to the derivative
of Jt, and then

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.410 align:middle line:84%
that just gives you
a delta function.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:31.910 align:middle line:84%
That just give you
a delta function.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.830 align:middle line:90%


00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.050 align:middle line:84%
So now let's look
at-- with this rule,

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:42.930 align:middle line:84%
then let's just look at the
delta, delta Jt on the ZJ.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:49.290 align:middle line:90%


00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.180 align:middle line:90%
So and then, yeah.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.250 align:middle line:84%
So, now, since this
is Jt, let's just,

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.950 align:middle line:84%
for convenience, let's just
put this to be t prime.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.510 align:middle line:90%


00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.242 align:middle line:90%
Let's put it to t prime.

00:11:00.242 --> 00:11:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you take
derivative with respect

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:07.085 align:middle line:84%
to Jt, and then you directly
take derivative with this guy.

00:11:07.085 --> 00:11:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you
take the derivative,

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.960 align:middle line:84%
the delta function will
get rid of this integral.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.060 align:middle line:90%
And then you just have xt.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And then you will just get
i DX(t) exponential i S.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, sorry,
you will get DX(t).

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
a factor of xt.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.920 align:middle line:90%
So let me just write Dx--

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.860 align:middle line:90%
again, to save, you just add Dx.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And you have xt from
taking derivative of Jt.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And then exponential
i S plus i Jx.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:48.370 align:middle line:90%
So let me just save some effort.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you should keep in mind
that this Dt is, actually, I'm

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.910 align:middle line:84%
just using a
simplified notation.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:58.130 align:middle line:90%


00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:58.630 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:11:59.547 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:11:59.547 --> 00:12:04.060 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:14.480 align:middle line:84%
So, now, if I also introduce
Z0, defined to be ZJ equal to 0.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is just the
original integral.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.930 align:middle line:84%
So Z0 is essentially
the downstairs.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:31.730 align:middle line:84%
So Z0 is just the Dx exponential
i S. So when J equal to 0,

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:32.960 align:middle line:90%
and then we just have this.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So, essentially, this
is the downstairs here.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.870 align:middle line:84%
So we also-- let's also
introduce this definition.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:41.510 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.450 align:middle line:90%
And then we then find--

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:47.150 align:middle line:84%
so, by comparing
the two, then we

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:53.120 align:middle line:84%
immediately conclude that the
one point function of x hat t0

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.950 align:middle line:84%
is just given by 1 over
i, because this i there,

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:02.290 align:middle line:90%
and 1 over Z0, then delta J--

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:07.630 align:middle line:90%
delta ZJ, delta Jt.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:11.820 align:middle line:90%
And then you set Jt equal to 0.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.020 align:middle line:84%
So, similarly, here, if you
set a equal to 0, so you take

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:20.000 align:middle line:84%
derivative, and then you
bring down a factor of xt.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.010 align:middle line:90%
And then you set J equal to 0.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And then you just have that
integral with xt there.

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you get this
one point function.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.440 align:middle line:84%
So, now, you can just
immediately generalize.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So this n-point function, Gn
then can be written as, you

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:41.800 align:middle line:90%
just take one--

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.850 align:middle line:90%
now you have take n derivatives.

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Now you have a factor of
1 over i to the power n.

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Again, you divide it by
Z0 because you always

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.710 align:middle line:90%
need to divide by this piece.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:14:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And then you just take
Z derivative n times.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:05.400 align:middle line:90%
So you take Jt1, Jtn.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So this time variable should
match with the time variable

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.700 align:middle line:90%
in the original definition.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And then, after you
take the derivative,

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.280 align:middle line:90%
you set J equal to 0.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:25.540 align:middle line:84%
So, and then, this gives
you the n-point function.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.790 align:middle line:84%
If you know how to compute
this ZJ, and, again,

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.550 align:middle line:90%
you only need to do derivatives.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.080 align:middle line:90%
And then it's much simpler.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Then you only need to do
the path integral once,

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:38.460 align:middle line:84%
and then you just
doing the derivatives.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.435 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:14:39.435 --> 00:14:53.960 align:middle line:90%


00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:57.690 align:middle line:84%
So, now, if you keep
in mind of this,

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:03.110 align:middle line:84%
we can also rewrite this
expression as the following.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.240 align:middle line:90%
We can also rewrite--

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:13.580 align:middle line:84%
alternatively, we can also write
ZJ divided by Z0 as following 0

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:25.560 align:middle line:84%
and the time ordered
exponential i, dt, Jt, xt, 0.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.320 align:middle line:90%


00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:33.180 align:middle line:84%
So, as I mentioned before, that
in that formula, in principle,

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:36.090 align:middle line:90%
x can be anything.

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:38.290 align:middle line:90%
x can be anything.

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:41.940 align:middle line:84%
So, now, in this
path integral, you

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.042 align:middle line:84%
can just imagine you
separate this term--

00:15:45.042 --> 00:15:46.500 align:middle line:84%
the sum of the two
exponential, you

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.214 align:middle line:90%
can just write it as a product.

00:15:48.214 --> 00:15:49.672 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the exponential i

00:15:49.672 --> 00:15:52.410 align:middle line:84%
S, and the exponential
i, this piece.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And then we treat
that piece to be x.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And then, that gives
you this formula.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.400 align:middle line:84%
If you treat that piece to be
x, it give you this formula.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Then you ask, what
is the meaning

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.760 align:middle line:84%
when we have a time ordering
of this exponential?

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.330 align:middle line:84%
So the meaning is
that, imagine you

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.570 align:middle line:90%
expand this in power series.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Imagine expand in
power series of x.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And then you just order each
term in the power series.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:27.790 align:middle line:84%
You can pick, because now
each term is a polynomial,

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.950 align:middle line:90%
you can time-order them.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:30.970 align:middle line:90%
You can time-order them.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.550 align:middle line:90%


00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.320 align:middle line:90%
So, now, this object--

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.460 align:middle line:90%
so I can also write this object.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.780 align:middle line:84%
So when you expand this
object, and then you--

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.700 align:middle line:90%
the first time is just 1.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:49.027 align:middle line:84%
And then, the next
term just Dt, Jt, then

00:16:49.027 --> 00:16:49.985 align:middle line:90%
the one-point function.

00:16:49.985 --> 00:16:54.570 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.570 --> 00:17:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And then, under the n'th
term, yeah, et cetera.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:05.099 align:middle line:84%
So you can, when
you expand it, you

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:09.329 align:middle line:84%
can just write from n equal
to infinity, 0 to infinity,

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:13.589 align:middle line:90%
i to the power n, n factorial.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:18.589 align:middle line:84%
Now you have n
integrals, t1, tn.

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:30.015 align:middle line:84%
Then you have times, you have
Gn, t1, tn, and the Jt1, Jtn.

00:17:30.015 --> 00:17:32.860 align:middle line:90%


00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.150 align:middle line:90%
So this is the typical--

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:36.140 align:middle line:90%
the n'th term is like that.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:39.730 align:middle line:84%
So when you expand
this to n'th power, you

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.530 align:middle line:90%
group all the x together.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.990 align:middle line:90%
Because J just C number--

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.150 align:middle line:84%
integration and the
J are C numbers.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.470 align:middle line:90%
You can take them out.

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And then this part is just
the x between the zeros

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:58.250 align:middle line:84%
and then you have
this factor of J. Yes.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.200 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Where did the
n factorial come from?

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.030 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Oh, just when
you expand the exponential,

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.080 align:middle line:90%
there's always n factorial.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.205 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Oh, right, sorry.

00:18:04.205 --> 00:18:05.560 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.060 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:06.977 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:18:06.977 --> 00:18:14.920 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.830 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: When you separate
out the exponentials

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:21.150 align:middle line:84%
into the e to the i S
and then the i integral.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.010 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:25.191 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is that S, and the
other term, like operator.

00:18:25.191 --> 00:18:26.941 align:middle line:84%
So you'd have to have
another contribution

00:18:26.941 --> 00:18:29.600 align:middle line:90%
from the commutators?

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.200 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Sorry, say it again?

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.150 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So, S, in that case,
it functions of an an operator.

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:37.794 align:middle line:84%
And then the other one
is also like an operator.

00:18:37.794 --> 00:18:40.433 align:middle line:84%
So wouldn't that
introduce commentators?

00:18:40.433 --> 00:18:41.350 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Because, in the path
integral, they're

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:44.067 align:middle line:90%
just ordinary functions.

00:18:44.067 --> 00:18:44.567 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:18:44.567 --> 00:18:44.905 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:18:44.905 --> 00:18:46.280 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: In the
path integrals,

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.450 align:middle line:90%
they're ordinary functions.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:48.880 align:middle line:84%
So, in the path
integral, they're

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.770 align:middle line:90%
always just ordinary functions.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.890 align:middle line:84%
But then, when we rewrite
them in terms of the operator

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:57.580 align:middle line:90%
form and then so--

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.340 align:middle line:84%
the left-hand side,
So the x, they're

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.880 align:middle line:90%
just ordinary functions.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.090 align:middle line:84%
But in the right-hand
side, I'm now writing it

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:05.650 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the operator form.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And now, indeed, now
the ordinary matters,

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.890 align:middle line:90%
Now the ordering matters.

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:11.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.240 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just using this form--
yeah, so, in this formula,

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.000 align:middle line:84%
the right-hand side is just
the ordinary functions.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.610 align:middle line:84%
But the left-hand side
involving some operator

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:22.245 align:middle line:84%
sandwiched between
the ground state.

00:19:22.245 --> 00:19:22.745 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:22.745 --> 00:19:27.120 align:middle line:90%


00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.430 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:31.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.430 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So in that
formula in the middle,

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.753 align:middle line:84%
where Gn is expressed as the
function derivative of Z--

00:19:36.753 --> 00:19:37.420 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.400 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Does it matter what
order I take the derivatives?

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.050 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, that
doesn't matter.

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, J is
ordinary functions.

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:45.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.515 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because this is
just the path integral.

00:19:47.515 --> 00:19:50.680 align:middle line:90%


00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.390 align:middle line:90%
J is just ordinary functions.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:53.860 align:middle line:84%
This is just some
functionals of J.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.720 align:middle line:84%
You can just take
arbitrary derivatives.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:01.246 align:middle line:84%
Also, you notice, on
the left-hand side,

00:20:01.246 --> 00:20:06.830 align:middle line:84%
so Gn is a function
of t1 and tn.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:09.200 align:middle line:84%
So Gn, as a function
of t1 and tn

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.500 align:middle line:84%
is actually
completely symmetric.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Because, under
this time ordering,

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.322 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter
how you order them.

00:20:16.322 --> 00:20:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Because they're just ordered
by time ordering anyway.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:23.270 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't matter how
I write the ordering here.

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:26.870 align:middle line:84%
So Gn is a symmetric
function of t1 and tn.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.490 align:middle line:90%
So you can see it here.

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.320 align:middle line:84%
So, here, because all the
derivative commute, and then

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.636 align:middle line:84%
this is a symmetric
function of t1 and tn.

00:20:35.636 --> 00:20:36.136 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:36.136 --> 00:20:41.570 align:middle line:90%


00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:44.890 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.980 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So, in the future, we often
just computing this object.

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:54.620 align:middle line:84%
We just often
computing this object.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.920 align:middle line:90%
And then, that will tell us--

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.110 align:middle line:84%
then that will give us
the generating functional

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:01.610 align:middle line:90%
of the correlation functions.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Then we can just obtain
correlation functions

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:05.930 align:middle line:90%
by taking derivatives.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.930 align:middle line:90%


00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:12.380 align:middle line:84%
So now let's look at
the explicit example

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:16.990 align:middle line:90%
to illustrate how this works.

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:25.130 align:middle line:84%
So let's just consider simple
example, a harmonic oscillator.

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:28.640 align:middle line:84%
So, almost always, a harmonic
oscillator is a good example.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.660 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.230 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So, in this case, so, again,
we look at this object.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:43.620 align:middle line:90%
But now S is--

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:47.470 align:middle line:84%
so we always now take from
minus infinity to plus infinity.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:49.050 align:middle line:90%
We have dt.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.610 align:middle line:90%
Then you have 1/2.

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.860 align:middle line:84%
So let's take this
to be my Lagrangian.

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:56.880 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.910 align:middle line:90%
So let me call this omega 0.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:04.870 align:middle line:84%
So this is considered the
essential harmonic oscillator.

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:06.660 align:middle line:90%
So I take the m equal to 1.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.300 align:middle line:90%


00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.340 align:middle line:90%
And I consider this Jt.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:18.730 align:middle line:84%
We are interested in
computing this object.

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:28.230 align:middle line:84%
So, also, I should
mention, in practice,

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:31.590 align:middle line:90%
so you always interested in xt.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Say, when you calculate
n-point functions,

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:38.200 align:middle line:90%
even though the value of t--

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.710 align:middle line:84%
say, suppose you want
to calculate the Gn.

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:45.190 align:middle line:90%
So Gn, you have n values of t.

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And so, outside
that n values of t,

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.530 align:middle line:90%
you can just take the J to be--

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:52.030 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:57.130 align:middle line:84%
So we can always take J to go
to 0 at the plus minus infinity.

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that helps your
integral to converge.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.425 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this is just
a side remark.

00:23:02.425 --> 00:23:06.220 align:middle line:90%


00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So, now, first, to compute
this object or this object,

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:16.990 align:middle line:84%
we need to first understand
what is this S epsilon.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:19.900 align:middle line:84%
We need to understand
what is this s epsilon.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:25.240 align:middle line:84%
So, remember, so, for
the harmonic oscillator,

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:31.510 align:middle line:84%
the Hamiltonian is p squared
divided by 2m plus 1/2 omega 0

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:32.770 align:middle line:90%
squared x squared.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:36.010 align:middle line:90%


00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And so, here is the Lagrangian,
and this is the Hamiltonian.

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:42.910 align:middle line:84%
They are related by
the Legendre transform.

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:46.410 align:middle line:90%


00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:51.690 align:middle line:84%
So now, in order to do this
H, go to H minus i epsilon.

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And then, now this become
p squared divided by 2m 1

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:02.940 align:middle line:84%
minus i epsilon, then
plus 1/2 omega 0 squared,

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:06.030 align:middle line:90%
x squared, 1 minus i epsilon.

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:10.050 align:middle line:84%
So you multiply the both
term by 1 minus i epsilon.

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And then, to obtain what is
the corresponding S for this,

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.820 align:middle line:84%
you just do a lot of
Legendre transform back

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.480 align:middle line:90%
into a Lagrangian.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.040 align:middle line:84%
So then you find
that the L epsilon,

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.340 align:middle line:84%
which you do corresponding
to the Legendre

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.620 align:middle line:90%
transform of this--

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:34.080 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so this is a trivial
exercise, which we can do.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Then you find that this
give, gets 1/2 x squared 1

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:41.040 align:middle line:90%
plus i epsilon.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And then, yeah, so, this part,
essentially, does not change,

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:49.530 align:middle line:84%
1/2 omega 0 squared x
squared 1 minus i epsilon.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.020 align:middle line:90%
So that's what you get.

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, when
you invert it, when

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:58.410 align:middle line:84%
you do the Legendre transform
to go to p, to x, somehow

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:00.420 align:middle line:84%
this becomes from
1 minus i epsilon

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:01.455 align:middle line:90%
become 1 plus i epsilon.

00:25:01.455 --> 00:25:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can easily
check yourself

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.150 align:middle line:90%
because you did do an inversion.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:13.995 align:middle line:84%
And so, now let's write this
into a more convenient form.

00:25:13.995 --> 00:25:18.570 align:middle line:90%


00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:21.600 align:middle line:84%
So to write it in a more
convenient form, we always--

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:28.170 align:middle line:84%
remember, we always treated
the x as a two x's sandwiched

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:29.820 align:middle line:90%
by some differential operator.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.620 align:middle line:84%
So we can do
integration by parts.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.590 align:middle line:84%
So we can do integration
by part to write it

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:42.450 align:middle line:84%
as minus 1/2 x partial t
squared plus omega 0 squared.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Then minus i epsilon omega
squared plus i epsilon

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:51.290 align:middle line:90%
partial t square x.

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:53.461 align:middle line:90%
And then plus total derivative.

00:25:53.461 --> 00:26:03.460 align:middle line:90%


00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.470 align:middle line:84%
So the total derivative
always vanished

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:09.190 align:middle line:90%
because we always-- yeah.

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Just, we always impose
boundary conditions.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:15.190 align:middle line:84%
So that at t equal to plus
minus infinity, they go to 0.

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:17.980 align:middle line:90%


00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And so, now let's
look at this object.

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:24.920 align:middle line:90%


00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:29.870 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at this object,
the epsilon dependence.

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:33.110 align:middle line:84%
So omega squared is
just a positive number.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Multiply epsilon, it's
still a positive number.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.730 align:middle line:90%
And epsilon infinitesimal.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:41.730 align:middle line:84%
So we can just still
call it i epsilon.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So, now, the partial t
square acting on epsilon.

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:50.280 align:middle line:84%
So partial t square is a
negative definite operator.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.420 align:middle line:90%


00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Because, remember, whenever
you do a Fourier transform

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:58.850 align:middle line:90%
on x, so partial t--

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:01.118 align:middle line:84%
a single factor
gives you i omega.

00:27:01.118 --> 00:27:02.660 align:middle line:84%
Then, if you have
a partial t square,

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.330 align:middle line:84%
then give you minus
omega squared.

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:11.810 align:middle line:84%
So partial t square is a
negative definite operator.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:14.360 align:middle line:84%
So that means that this
is also a negative number

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.340 align:middle line:90%
times i epsilon.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And then, that means we can
just write the whole thing just

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:24.950 align:middle line:84%
as 1/2 x partial t square
plus omega 0 square

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:28.910 align:middle line:90%
then minus i epsilon x.

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:35.000 align:middle line:90%


00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:35.500 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:38.130 align:middle line:90%
Is this clear?

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because just
anything, any positives

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:47.105 align:middle line:84%
in multiplying epsilon
still give you epsilon.

00:27:47.105 --> 00:27:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Because it's just
a small number.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.230 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:55.100 align:middle line:90%


00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.740 align:middle line:84%
So now we can write
this S xt, now

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:04.970 align:middle line:84%
we can write the
S epsilon xt then

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:09.420 align:middle line:84%
in the following form
in the minus 1/2.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Let me write as dt, dt
prime as we wrote before.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Then xt Kt, t
prime and xt prime.

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And then, Kt, t prime is just
given by delta t minus t prime,

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:41.350 align:middle line:84%
say partial t prime squared
minus omega 0 squared

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:48.290 align:middle line:90%
minus epsilon, or plus, yeah.

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:53.870 align:middle line:84%
So, again, we just
introduce a lot of t prime.

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I introduce
a delta function.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.120 align:middle line:90%
And now we have a matrix form.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, this action
has a matrix structure.

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:12.712 align:middle line:90%


00:29:12.712 --> 00:29:16.350 align:middle line:84%
So now, this S
depend on epsilon.

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:17.490 align:middle line:90%
Now S depend on epsilon.

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:21.770 align:middle line:90%


00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:22.270 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:24.850 align:middle line:90%


00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:25.350 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:26.280 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:29.370 align:middle line:84%
So now we can evaluate--
now we can now ready

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:33.300 align:middle line:90%
to evaluate this path integral.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.777 align:middle line:84%
Now we are ready to
evaluate the path integral.

00:29:36.777 --> 00:29:37.860 align:middle line:90%
So let's first look at Z0.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.475 align:middle line:90%


00:29:41.475 --> 00:29:42.600 align:middle line:90%
And let's first look at Z0.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Z0 is just the Gaussian
integral we already said before.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:57.070 align:middle line:84%
So the Z0 is the
Gaussian integral.

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:59.670 align:middle line:90%
So I will be schematic.

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:05.630 align:middle line:90%


00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:09.575 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, this x dot K dot x.

00:30:09.575 --> 00:30:13.961 align:middle line:90%


00:30:13.961 --> 00:30:20.400 align:middle line:84%
So this is a shorthand notation
to denote this two integral.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.750 align:middle line:90%
I think it's positive i.

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:25.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, minus sign.

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:26.410 align:middle line:90%
I have a minus sign here.

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:27.210 align:middle line:90%
So it's minus i.

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:28.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:29.280 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So, and this, as we said
before, this is just

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:35.250 align:middle line:84%
given by some constant
and determinant

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:40.133 align:middle line:84%
K. This is just some
constant determinant K. Yes?

00:30:40.133 --> 00:30:40.800 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.240 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:42.840 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.552 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Why did you have
to go to the Hamiltonian

00:30:45.552 --> 00:30:49.300 align:middle line:90%
to put that 1 minus i epsilon?

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.110 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:53.140 align:middle line:84%
It's because that's
our previous rule.

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Because we say, in
order to derive this,

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:00.495 align:middle line:84%
we use the cheek to
take the H, go to--

00:31:00.495 --> 00:31:01.910 align:middle line:90%
yeah, H 1 minus epsilon.

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So we want to know how this
translate into the behavior

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:06.430 align:middle line:90%
in the action.

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:09.140 align:middle line:90%


00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:10.100 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:15.730 align:middle line:90%


00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:17.510 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:23.030 align:middle line:84%
So this is just the same
as we discussed before just

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:25.850 align:middle line:84%
given by some constant
and determinant K.

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:29.150 align:middle line:84%
As we said before, that the
C is typically divergent.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Determinant the K, so
typically divergent.

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.740 align:middle line:84%
But we will see,
it doesn't matter.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.160 align:middle line:84%
So now we will see, it doesn't--
so, previously, we said,

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.810 align:middle line:90%
this will not matter.

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:42.270 align:middle line:84%
But now we will
see it explicitly.

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:43.460 align:middle line:90%
So now let's look at the ZJ.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:46.190 align:middle line:90%


00:31:46.190 --> 00:32:01.750 align:middle line:84%
So ZJ is the same
integral, x dot K dot x.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:05.110 align:middle line:84%
But, now, with this
additional term.

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:08.130 align:middle line:84%
So let me just write,
again, in the simplified

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:11.100 align:middle line:90%
notation, as J dot x.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:16.490 align:middle line:84%
So you view the integration as
a huge sum of vector-- yeah,

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:17.115 align:middle line:90%
vector product.

00:32:17.115 --> 00:32:21.420 align:middle line:90%


00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:23.430 align:middle line:84%
So if this is a finite
dimensional integral,

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:26.700 align:middle line:90%
you say, I know how to do this.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:32.160 align:middle line:84%
We know how to do this
because this is just

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:37.050 align:middle line:84%
the Gaussian with
a linear piece.

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:41.650 align:middle line:84%
So we can just write
down the answer.

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:46.650 align:middle line:84%
So let's just-- yeah,
the rule is that you just

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:49.440 align:middle line:84%
treat it as a finite
dimensional integral

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.840 align:middle line:84%
and write the answer for the
finite dimensional integral.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And then you
translate the language

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:58.050 align:middle line:84%
in terms of this
functional case.

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:00.400 align:middle line:90%
So we can write it--

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:04.617 align:middle line:84%
so, again, this would be C
divided by delta K. Yeah.

00:33:04.617 --> 00:33:05.700 align:middle line:90%
So let me just remind you.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Maybe just let me just
do a little bit slower.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:12.180 align:middle line:84%
So let me just remind
you the standard story

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.040 align:middle line:90%
for such a Gaussian integral.

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:21.805 align:middle line:84%
So if you have dx1, dxn,
exponential minus 1/2 xi,

00:33:21.805 --> 00:33:27.450 align:middle line:90%
Aij, xj plus Ji, xi.

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:31.730 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an
integral like this,

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:33.290 align:middle line:84%
we know how to
compute this integral.

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:34.610 align:middle line:90%
We can just compute--

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:39.560 align:middle line:84%
include the xi into here
by completing the square.

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:42.615 align:middle line:84%
And then, what you
get is the following.

00:33:42.615 --> 00:33:44.240 align:middle line:84%
After you complete
the square, you just

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.400 align:middle line:84%
get the original
Gaussian integral.

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:53.765 align:middle line:84%
And so, what you get is
you get the 2 pi D over 2,

00:33:53.765 --> 00:33:56.760 align:middle line:90%
or your previous case, delta a.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And then, the results you get
from the complete integral

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:05.788 align:middle line:90%
is Ji A minus 1 Ij, Jj.

00:34:05.788 --> 00:34:08.330 align:middle line:84%
So when you complete the square,
you get the additional term.

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:09.267 align:middle line:90%
That's what you get.

00:34:09.267 --> 00:34:11.434 align:middle line:84%
And this is coming from
doing the Gaussian integral.

00:34:11.434 --> 00:34:14.135 align:middle line:90%


00:34:14.135 --> 00:34:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So now we just have an
infinite dimensional version

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:18.100 align:middle line:90%
of this integral.

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And we can just write down
the result immediately.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.929 align:middle line:84%
We can just write down
the result immediately.

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:29.350 align:middle line:90%
So we just copy that thing.

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:33.960 align:middle line:84%
So we have C. So this C will be
the exact the same as that C,

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:38.370 align:middle line:84%
because this just comes from
doing a Gaussian integral as

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:41.540 align:middle line:90%
if J is not there.

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So we have the same C.
We have the same delta k.

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Then, according to the
rule there, up to the i,

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:54.850 align:middle line:84%
which is you have to put
in, then we get 1/2 i.

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:59.320 align:middle line:84%
Then you have-- then we
should have J k minus 1

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:03.220 align:middle line:90%
J. So this is essentially that.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:08.060 align:middle line:84%
You take the inverse of
A. So here we get that.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And this, if we translate back
into this kind of function

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:21.040 align:middle line:84%
language, so this just gives
you C delta K exponential i

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.540 align:middle line:90%
divided by 2.

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:25.570 align:middle line:90%
Then you have dt, dt prime.

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Then you have Jt, K minus
1, t, again, t prime.

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:34.710 align:middle line:84%
So K minus 1 should be
understood as the inverse

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:37.770 align:middle line:90%
of this K and Jt prime.

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:48.900 align:middle line:90%


00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:53.630 align:middle line:84%
So the K minus 1 is
defined as follows.

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:56.290 align:middle line:90%
So the K is--

00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:58.750 align:middle line:84%
so you just, again, is the
function generalization

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:01.420 align:middle line:90%
of the matrix case.

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:06.190 align:middle line:84%
So you just have t
prime, K, t, t prime,

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:10.330 align:middle line:84%
and K minus 1, t
prime, t double prime

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:14.230 align:middle line:84%
should be equal to delta
t minus t double prime.

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:17.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's how you
define the K, K minus 1.

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is like
a matrix product.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:23.020 align:middle line:90%
Just now you treat the t prime--

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.920 align:middle line:84%
yeah, t prime, you sum
over that, and then, yeah.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:33.400 align:middle line:84%
So this is just like you
have kmn, k minus n, and k

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.500 align:middle line:90%
equal to delta mk.

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.230 align:middle line:84%
You just translate the
n into the integral.

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:41.230 align:middle line:90%
And the t is corresponding to m.

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And the t double prime
corresponding to K.

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And the delta function
corresponding to that.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.210 align:middle line:90%


00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:50.700 align:middle line:84%
So that's how we
define the K minus 1.

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is
the result for ZJ.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:04.680 align:middle line:90%


00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So, now, the physical
object is this object

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:10.650 align:middle line:90%
is the DJ divided by Z0.

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Because you get the
expectation value,

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:15.780 align:middle line:90%
we always need to divide by Z0.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:21.000 align:middle line:84%
So now, if we take the ratio,
so now I can erase this.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:29.780 align:middle line:84%
So if we take the
ratio, ZJ divided by Z0,

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:32.660 align:middle line:84%
we find all these
factor canceled.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:36.060 align:middle line:84%
So this factor cancels
with that factor.

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.010 align:middle line:90%
So it doesn't matter.

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:39.620 align:middle line:90%
So we just get exponential.

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:46.105 align:middle line:84%
So, let me, again, using this
shorthand notation, i over 2,

00:37:46.105 --> 00:37:55.070 align:middle line:84%
J K minus 1 J. So this
is the physical quantity.

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:58.590 align:middle line:90%


00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And when we expand
this in powers of J,

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:04.920 align:middle line:84%
then we get the correlation--
then the coefficient of J

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.480 align:middle line:90%
give you correlation functions.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.010 align:middle line:90%
Or we can just take derivatives.

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:08.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:12.688 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so last time
I thought you said the C

00:38:12.688 --> 00:38:15.080 align:middle line:84%
and the determinant
of K can be infinite.

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:18.654 align:middle line:84%
So is it OK to divide infinity
by infinity and just say it's 1

00:38:18.654 --> 00:38:20.100 align:middle line:90%
in this case?

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:23.280 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, it's not one,
because they are actually--

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:27.300 align:middle line:84%
yeah, as you do
in your Pset, say,

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:34.410 align:middle line:84%
if you have a free particle,
that ratio is actually--

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:36.270 align:middle line:84%
you can calculate to
be a finite number.

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:37.170 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:39.240 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Even though
their ratio is actually,

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:40.770 align:middle line:90%
both are infinite.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:44.750 align:middle line:84%
But the ratio is
actually a finite number.

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:45.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, same thing with
the harmonic oscillator.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:48.198 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:48.198 --> 00:38:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but the key thing
is that we actually

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:51.350 align:middle line:90%
don't need to worry about them.

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:52.910 align:middle line:90%
They just cancel.

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:53.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:57.830 align:middle line:90%


00:38:57.830 --> 00:38:58.790 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:04.390 align:middle line:90%


00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:11.200 align:middle line:84%
So now, this is our final result
for the harmonic oscillator.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And except we still
have to invert this K.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:25.430 align:middle line:84%
We still have to invert
this K. But, in fact--

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:30.120 align:middle line:90%


00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:35.040 align:middle line:84%
but, before we do that, first
we can see what is this--

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.110 align:middle line:84%
whether there's any
physical interpretation

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:38.400 align:middle line:90%
for this K minus 1.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.220 align:middle line:90%


00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:44.980 align:middle line:84%
So let's just consider
the following situation.

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:47.950 align:middle line:84%
So let's consider a
two-point function.

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So, first, from here,
you can immediately see,

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:55.780 align:middle line:84%
the one-point function is
given by what, the vacuum

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:59.690 align:middle line:90%
one-point function of x?

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:04.940 align:middle line:84%
So can you see what is the
vacuum one-point function for x

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:08.460 align:middle line:90%
without doing calculation?

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:09.820 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: 0?

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.010 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yes, 0.

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:14.260 align:middle line:84%
So the reason it's 0,
it says because if you

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:17.590 align:middle line:84%
get one-point function, you
take one derivative with J.

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:20.230 align:middle line:84%
So when you take one derivative
is J, because of here,

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:21.880 align:middle line:90%
it's J square.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.460 align:middle line:84%
You will bring
down a factor of J.

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Then, when you set the J equal
to 0, and then that will be 0.

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.410 align:middle line:84%
So the one-point function
automatically is 0.

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's consistent
with our expectation.

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.970 align:middle line:84%
In the harmonic oscillator,
the one-point function of x

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:41.980 align:middle line:84%
is always 0 because x
involve a or a dagger.

00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:45.400 align:middle line:84%
When you sandwiched between
two zeros, it's just 0.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:47.800 align:middle line:84%
But now, so notice,
the non-vanishing one

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.190 align:middle line:90%
is the two-point function.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:51.650 align:middle line:84%
So now let's consider
the two-point function.

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:54.100 align:middle line:84%
So two-point function
by definition

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:59.030 align:middle line:84%
should be the Feynman
function because this

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:02.120 align:middle line:90%
is a time-ordered product.

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.770 align:middle line:84%
So the two-point
function, by definition,

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:05.970 align:middle line:90%
is the Feynman function.

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:06.820 align:middle line:90%
It's the G2.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:09.710 align:middle line:90%


00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is given
by just this expand--

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:19.550 align:middle line:90%
yeah, just 1 over Z0 i square.

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:23.930 align:middle line:90%
You take ZJ, two derivatives.

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:26.600 align:middle line:90%


00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:32.165 align:middle line:84%
delta Jt, delta Jt prime, and
then you take J equal to 0.

00:41:32.165 --> 00:41:40.430 align:middle line:90%


00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:41.675 align:middle line:90%
So the-- yeah.

00:41:41.675 --> 00:41:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So the two-point function is a
Feynman propagator [INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.360 align:middle line:90%


00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.570 align:middle line:84%
So, here, we can just see
what we get from here.

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:50.200 align:middle line:90%


00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So when you take two
derivatives on this,

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:57.380 align:middle line:84%
you take two
derivative on J again.

00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:59.590 align:middle line:84%
So the first derivative
on J you bring down

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:03.720 align:middle line:84%
a factor of K times J. And
your second derivative,

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.020 align:middle line:90%
we can do two things.

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:06.900 align:middle line:84%
You can act on the
exponential again.

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you can act-- or
you can act on the J factor

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.400 align:middle line:84%
which you bring
down the first time.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.970 align:middle line:90%


00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:15.470 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
act on the factor

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:18.770 align:middle line:84%
of J you bring the first time,
because you have any free J

00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:19.670 align:middle line:90%
left.

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And when you set J equal to
0, there will be equal to 0.

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So the both
derivative should act

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.980 align:middle line:90%
on this J, which come together.

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:34.770 align:middle line:84%
So, here, then you get minus i,
essentially, K minus 1 t and t

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:35.850 align:middle line:90%
prime.

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Just take these two derivatives,
then you get K minus 1.

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:50.480 align:middle line:84%
So now, we learned something
nice is that this K minus 1,

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.090 align:middle line:84%
it's actually the
Feynman propagator.

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:55.790 align:middle line:84%
We discussed before, the Feynman
function, we discussed before.

00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:59.090 align:middle line:90%


00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the harmonic oscillator
version of the Feynman

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.170 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:06.240 align:middle line:84%
So, previously, we defined
for the field theory.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is the harmonic
oscillator version

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:09.665 align:middle line:90%
of the Feynman function.

00:43:09.665 --> 00:43:15.350 align:middle line:90%


00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:23.590 align:middle line:84%
So we find that K minus 1 t,
t prime is just equal to--

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:26.560 align:middle line:90%
actually, i GF t, t prime.

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.290 align:middle line:90%


00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:31.040 align:middle line:84%
So you find that this
is just given by GF.

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:38.620 align:middle line:90%


00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:48.130 align:middle line:84%
So, and then, we learned
that the ZJ divided by Z0

00:43:48.130 --> 00:44:10.100 align:middle line:84%
is just equal to exponential
now minus 1/2 J GF J.

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:11.480 align:middle line:90%
So now, it's just GF.

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.850 align:middle line:84%
It's just everything
determined by this GF.

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:16.980 align:middle line:90%


00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:21.000 align:middle line:84%
So now we have a
consistency check.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Now we have a consistency
check because, previously, we

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:29.300 align:middle line:84%
have discussed that
the GF should satisfy

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:32.120 align:middle line:90%
certain differential equation.

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And here we have a
differential equation for K.

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:40.010 align:middle line:84%
So K minus 1 also satisfy
a differential equation.

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:44.120 align:middle line:90%
It just satisfy this equation.

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And so, now, if you plug
in there and into here,

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:55.920 align:middle line:84%
OK if by definition,
so from this equation.

00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:03.770 align:middle line:84%
So let me call this
equation star, star, star,

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:05.000 align:middle line:90%
and this equation star.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.160 align:middle line:90%


00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:19.080 align:middle line:84%
So from equation
star and star, star,

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:24.840 align:middle line:84%
and we find that K
minus 1 should satisfy

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:34.390 align:middle line:84%
the following equation
of the partial t squared

00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:41.770 align:middle line:84%
minus omega 0 squared plus
omega 0 minus i epsilon GF.

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:42.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:53.070 align:middle line:84%
K minus 1 should be equal to
the delta t minus t prime.

00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:55.080 align:middle line:84%
So let me just make sure
I get the sign correct.

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.810 align:middle line:90%


00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:00.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:02.630 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:06.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I think this is right.

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And now, if you plug
in this expression,

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:13.060 align:middle line:84%
and then you find that this
equation is actually exactly

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:16.180 align:middle line:84%
our definition of the
Feynman propagator before.

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Here we don't have
spatial derivatives.

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:22.690 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at it, in
particular this i epsilon is

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:24.430 align:middle line:84%
precisely the i
epsilon previously we

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:27.580 align:middle line:84%
need to use to define
the Feynman propagator.

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And now we find that the
epsilon prescription, which

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:35.440 align:middle line:84%
we previously used as a trick
to define the Feynman propagator

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:38.860 align:middle line:84%
is actually recovered
by this procedure--

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:42.603 align:middle line:84%
recovered by that procedure
of H goes to, yeah, 1

00:46:42.603 --> 00:46:43.270 align:middle line:90%
minus i epsilon.

00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:46.290 align:middle line:90%


00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:47.940 align:middle line:90%
Just everything is consistent.

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Just now you precisely
recover that procedure.

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:53.780 align:middle line:90%


00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:55.100 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:46:55.100 --> 00:47:06.190 align:middle line:90%


00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:07.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:09.287 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So I guess in
that expression right there.

00:47:09.287 --> 00:47:10.420 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:12.670 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: If J is a function,
if you just integrate it

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:14.560 align:middle line:90%
over t and t prime?

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Exponential negative
1/2 J dot GF dot J?

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:18.255 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Oh, you
mean this expansion?

00:47:18.255 --> 00:47:18.880 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:19.840 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:23.422 align:middle line:84%
So if I write it explicitly,
you just have, yeah.

00:47:23.422 --> 00:47:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Let me write it
explicit since this

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.380 align:middle line:90%
is a very important equation.

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this is just dt, dt
prime, Jt, GF, t, t prime,

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:37.510 align:middle line:90%
and Jt prime.

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:39.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.970 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:45.540 align:middle line:90%


00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:48.270 align:middle line:90%
So this is all consistent.

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:53.700 align:middle line:84%
So this i epsilon prescription,
which we did here,

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:56.130 align:middle line:84%
automatically recovers
the i epsilon prescription

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:59.950 align:middle line:84%
in the definition of the Feynman
function we defined before.

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:04.100 align:middle line:90%
So it's very nice.

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And, in particular, so
in momentum space, if you

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:11.780 align:middle line:84%
find the momentum
space, GF omega,

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:14.480 align:middle line:84%
if you go to the momentum
space, and then you

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:18.395 align:middle line:84%
find just equal to i
omega squared minus omega

00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:21.320 align:middle line:90%
0 squared plus i epsilon.

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.660 align:middle line:84%
So you see this is
actually the previous.

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:27.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you compare with
our previous expression

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:31.580 align:middle line:84%
for the Feynman function,
when you set k square to 0

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:35.120 align:middle line:84%
and replace the omega
0 square by m square,

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:37.940 align:middle line:84%
then that's exactly the
one we derived before.

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:46.395 align:middle line:90%


00:48:46.395 --> 00:48:46.895 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:48:46.895 --> 00:48:50.040 align:middle line:90%


00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So now we can try to find
the n-point functions.

00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:57.000 align:middle line:84%
So now we can work out
the all n-point functions.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:04.030 align:middle line:90%


00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:08.980 align:middle line:84%
So now you can
immediately conclude

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:17.650 align:middle line:84%
from the way we do the
one-point function that all

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:26.830 align:middle line:84%
n-point functions, so general
n for general odd n Gn

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:30.200 align:middle line:90%
is always 0.

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.770 align:middle line:90%
Gn is always 0.

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:34.510 align:middle line:90%
So the reason is the following.

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:37.150 align:middle line:90%


00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:44.490 align:middle line:84%
When we carry out this procedure
to take the derivatives,

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:48.175 align:middle line:84%
so because the J is always
paired in this exponential.

00:49:48.175 --> 00:49:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So when you take one
derivative, you're

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:53.490 align:middle line:84%
bringing down another J.
So because, in the end,

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:54.500 align:middle line:90%
we set J equal to 0.

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:58.940 align:middle line:84%
So you have to get rid of all
these J which you bring down

00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:00.800 align:middle line:90%
from the exponential.

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And then that means,
n has to be even.

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So if n is odd, then
there's always one J left.

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you set J equal
to 0, and then will be 0.

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:13.910 align:middle line:84%
So this is also consistent
with your experience

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:16.940 align:middle line:84%
from harmonic oscillator
because, in the harmonic

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:19.880 align:middle line:84%
oscillator, if you have
all the number of x, then

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:22.970 align:middle line:84%
you have all the number
of a and a dagger.

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:25.970 align:middle line:84%
If you have all the number
of a and a dagger together,

00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:28.370 align:middle line:84%
there's no way when they're
sandwiched between 0

00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:32.750 align:middle line:84%
and they can annihilate each
other, and you will-- yeah.

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:35.390 align:middle line:90%
So you will always get 0.

00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:39.080 align:middle line:90%
And so, here, we get it.

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:39.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:47.105 align:middle line:84%
So now, for the even n,
there's also a simple answer.

00:50:47.105 --> 00:50:50.180 align:middle line:90%


00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:53.980 align:middle line:90%
If I have an n-point function--

00:50:53.980 --> 00:51:00.190 align:middle line:84%
so let me just write down
Gn, say equal to 0 to t,

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:06.850 align:middle line:90%
say x hat t1, tn.

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So for even n, then
you see that, again,

00:51:14.850 --> 00:51:17.160 align:middle line:84%
because in order for
this not to be 0,

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:20.730 align:middle line:90%
then all the x has to be paired.

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:22.770 align:middle line:90%
Then all the x has to be paired.

00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:25.020 align:middle line:90%
So, in this case, we just sum--

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:27.810 align:middle line:90%


00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:36.380 align:middle line:84%
so, in this case, the answer
is just sum over all possible

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:46.760 align:middle line:90%
contractions between x ti's.

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:53.960 align:middle line:84%
So by contraction we
mean, so if I have xti,

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:58.980 align:middle line:84%
xtj, we say there's a
contraction between them.

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's just
defined to be GF xi xj.

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:07.980 align:middle line:90%


00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:09.060 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no. ti, tj.

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:13.410 align:middle line:90%


00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:16.570 align:middle line:90%
So you just pair all of them.

00:52:16.570 --> 00:52:18.160 align:middle line:90%
So each pair is a contraction.

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:21.700 align:middle line:84%
You just sum over all possible
contractions, pair of them,

00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:25.930 align:middle line:84%
and each pairing gives
you a Feynman function.

00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So each pairing gives
you a Feynman function.

00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is actually, in
the early days of quantum field

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:41.180 align:middle line:84%
theory when you don't have
a path integral, to show

00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:42.470 align:middle line:90%
this is actually non-trivial.

00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:46.850 align:middle line:84%
Because imagine if you do
this time ordered product.

00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:49.053 align:middle line:90%
There are many, many pieces.

00:52:49.053 --> 00:52:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have
an n-point function,

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:52.803 align:middle line:84%
then you have to write
down all possible orderings

00:52:52.803 --> 00:52:54.380 align:middle line:90%
between them.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:56.840 align:middle line:84%
But, in the end, it's
a very simple result.

00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.910 align:middle line:84%
You just sum of all
possible contractions.

00:52:58.910 --> 00:53:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And each pair is
the time ordered.

00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And so, these the early
days without path integral

00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:09.690 align:middle line:84%
is actually a highly
non-trivial result.

00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And so, this was
first proved by Wick.

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:15.800 align:middle line:84%
So this is called
the Wick theorem.

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:18.410 align:middle line:84%
But now, we see, it's actually,
if you know the path integral,

00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:21.030 align:middle line:84%
then it's a trivial
consequence of that.

00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:23.480 align:middle line:84%
The path integral is
actually quadratic in J.

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.220 align:middle line:90%
It's quadratic in J.

00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, so give
you an example.

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:30.180 align:middle line:90%


00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at
four-point functions.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:54:03.830 align:middle line:90%


00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:05.620 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
four-point functions.

00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:13.273 align:middle line:90%


00:54:13.273 --> 00:54:15.190 align:middle line:84%
So I don't even have to
write that thing down.

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's just draw four dots
below to the four points.

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:22.180 align:middle line:90%


00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And then, I just sum over
all pairing between them.

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And each pairing will give
me a Feynman propagator.

00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:34.990 align:middle line:84%
So 1, I compare 1
and a 2 or 3 and 4.

00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And I can also pair
1 and 3 and 2 and 4.

00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And I can also pair 1
with 4 and the 2 with 3.

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:56.935 align:middle line:90%


00:54:56.935 --> 00:55:00.500 align:middle line:90%
Oh, 2-- 2 is here.

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:01.420 align:middle line:90%
So 2 with 3.

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:04.270 align:middle line:90%
I can also do that pairing.

00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And so, if I write it in
terms of the expressions,

00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:22.720 align:middle line:84%
then I have GF t1, t2-- let
me just, t1, t2, GF, t3, t4

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:34.040 align:middle line:90%
plus GF, t1, t3, GF, t2, t4.

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Then plus the GF, t1, t4
plus times GF, t2, t3.

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:48.340 align:middle line:90%


00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:52.480 align:middle line:84%
So you just sum over
all such pairings.

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:56.320 align:middle line:90%
And each pairing gives you a GF.

00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:57.123 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:55:57.123 --> 00:55:57.790 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:55:57.790 --> 00:55:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I thought because of
the time of ordering,

00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:03.180 align:middle line:90%
you can't choose your pairing.

00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:04.893 align:middle line:90%
There's only one way to pair.

00:56:04.893 --> 00:56:06.060 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: What do you mean?

00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:09.435 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Why is it ok to do
different pairings even though

00:56:09.435 --> 00:56:12.055 align:middle line:90%
it's-- things are time ordered?

00:56:12.055 --> 00:56:14.980 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Oh, what do you
mean, you cannot do the pairing?

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:16.483 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: The x's
are time ordered.

00:56:16.483 --> 00:56:17.150 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:17.820 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: The x's.

00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:18.487 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:56:18.487 --> 00:56:21.720 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So wouldn't you have
to pair them in that order?

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:22.860 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: No.

00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:23.690 align:middle line:90%
So that's the key.

00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:26.850 align:middle line:84%
You just, somehow, this is the
consequence of the theorem.

00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:29.257 align:middle line:84%
If you want to just
write down the orderings,

00:56:29.257 --> 00:56:30.840 align:middle line:84%
then it's actually
rather complicated.

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:32.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:35.940 align:middle line:84%
But, somehow, the magic is that
once you, say, write everything

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:39.780 align:middle line:84%
explicitly, you do
all the everything,

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:42.180 align:middle line:84%
in the end you can group
everything just in terms

00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:44.048 align:middle line:84%
of product of the
Feynman functions.

00:56:44.048 --> 00:56:44.548 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:44.548 --> 00:56:47.150 align:middle line:90%


00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:48.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:50.400 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So for the
harmonic oscillator,

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:54.500 align:middle line:84%
we know that at a given point in
time, the position is Gaussian.

00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And so, that would mean that
the n-point function for all

00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:00.670 align:middle line:84%
the t's equal to
each other should

00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:04.720 align:middle line:84%
be non-zero only for
n equal to 1 or 2

00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:06.110 align:middle line:90%
but not for n greater, right?

00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Because only the first
two moments of a Gaussian

00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:10.220 align:middle line:90%
are non-zero.

00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:13.700 align:middle line:84%
That seems inconsistent with
the prescription over here.

00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:14.780 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Why are you saying that?

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.770 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: At a given time, the--

00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:21.140 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, but all
these time are different.

00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:24.180 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Right, but if I were
to take the times to be equal.

00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:25.160 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: OK, yeah.

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:29.320 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Then so, for example,
the variance of the particle

00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:32.898 align:middle line:84%
position would be your two-point
function evaluated at t and--

00:57:32.898 --> 00:57:33.565 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:57:33.565 --> 00:57:34.440 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.813 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, this is
just the x to the power n.

00:57:36.813 --> 00:57:37.480 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:39.790 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
the x to the power n

00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:42.850 align:middle line:90%
is non-zero for even power.

00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:44.470 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yes,
but then, so then,

00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:47.163 align:middle line:84%
in this formula,
that'd be GF t comma t.

00:57:47.163 --> 00:57:47.830 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:48.880 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Which is non-zero.

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:49.547 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:57:49.547 --> 00:57:50.623 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: But--

00:57:50.623 --> 00:57:52.290 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but
the GF is non-zero.

00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:55.380 align:middle line:90%


00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:57.130 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Right, but
then, what I'm saying

00:57:57.130 --> 00:57:58.750 align:middle line:84%
is, the four-point
function then would also

00:57:58.750 --> 00:57:59.930 align:middle line:90%
give you something non-zero.

00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:01.975 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it is non-zero.

00:58:01.975 --> 00:58:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's very consistent.

00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:05.308 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: But the fourth
moment of the Gaussian is 0.

00:58:05.308 --> 00:58:06.360 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: No.

00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:10.220 align:middle line:84%
The fourth moment of Gaussian
certainly is non-zero.

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, x4, yeah,
Gaussian you have x4.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.088 align:middle line:90%
That's certainly non-zero.

00:58:16.088 --> 00:58:19.469 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: But the means is 0,
so all cumulants higher than 2

00:58:19.469 --> 00:58:21.550 align:middle line:90%
are zero for a Gaussian?

00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:22.780 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:25.480 align:middle line:84%
For the Gaussian, it
is all how equivalent

00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:28.413 align:middle line:84%
can be expressed in
terms of the sigma

00:58:28.413 --> 00:58:29.705 align:middle line:90%
and in terms of the two points.

00:58:29.705 --> 00:58:33.610 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, here is just exactly
what you show here.

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:34.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Just everything can
be expressed in terms

00:58:36.310 --> 00:58:38.900 align:middle line:90%
of the two-point moment.

00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:39.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:44.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you set all the t to be
0, so this is GF is the same.

00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:45.310 align:middle line:90%
So this is GF.

00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, the only
difference between them.

00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:48.207 align:middle line:90%
So this is GF.

00:58:48.207 --> 00:58:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, essentially you just
add them together just,

00:58:50.290 --> 00:58:51.790 align:middle line:90%
read GF squared.

00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:52.630 align:middle line:90%
And, yeah.

00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just do this
exercise yourself,

00:58:54.850 --> 00:58:56.350 align:middle line:90%
and you will see it's the same.

00:58:56.350 --> 00:58:59.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:59.180 --> 00:58:59.680 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:03.240 align:middle line:90%


00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:10.480 align:middle line:84%
So now, with this preparation
in quantum mechanics,

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:13.890 align:middle line:84%
now we can immediately
just move in field theory.

00:59:13.890 --> 00:59:16.680 align:middle line:84%
So now we can immediately
move to field theory.

00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:30.938 align:middle line:84%
So now you can say time ordered
functions in field theory.

00:59:30.938 --> 00:59:37.030 align:middle line:90%


00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:39.780 align:middle line:84%
So, before we do that,
any other questions?

00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:46.660 align:middle line:90%


00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:48.580 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:53.890 align:middle line:84%
So, again, to go
to field theory,

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:59.760 align:middle line:84%
now the only thing we need
is just copy notations.

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.630 align:middle line:84%
You just need to
change the notations.

01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:05.650 align:middle line:90%
Just remember how you--

01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:10.360 align:middle line:84%
yeah, just replace the
appropriate dynamic variable

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:13.570 align:middle line:84%
in quantum mechanics by the
appropriate dynamic variables

01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:14.530 align:middle line:90%
in field theory.

01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:17.620 align:middle line:90%
And then that's it.

01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:19.880 align:middle line:90%
So let's write down.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.970 align:middle line:84%
So now we have, consider,
in field theory,

01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:24.400 align:middle line:84%
suppose we consider
this n-point function.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And now, xn-- now xn denote
the space time point now.

01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:33.250 align:middle line:90%
So let me call the--

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:35.650 align:middle line:84%
previously we call the
vacuum for the field theory

01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:38.030 align:middle line:84%
to be omega in the
interacting theory.

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So now you can see that this
quantity, phi x1 and the phi

01:00:43.570 --> 01:00:47.600 align:middle line:84%
xn, let's look at this endpoint
function between the vacuum.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:51.710 align:middle line:90%


01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So now, again, if we
call this thing to be X,

01:00:59.350 --> 01:01:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So now we can
immediately write down

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:05.020 align:middle line:84%
the answer in field
theory, just the D phi.

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Now you just replace
the DX by D phi.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Then you'll, again, you
just have this X, capital X.

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And then you have now i S
phi then divided by D phi

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:19.800 align:middle line:90%
without i S phi.

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:25.010 align:middle line:90%


01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And another boundary
condition is

01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:33.530 align:middle line:84%
that the phi, when you
do this integral, again,

01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:36.930 align:middle line:84%
t goes to infinity to
minus infinity to infinity.

01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And now tx will-- should go to 0
for both t plus minus infinity.

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's the analog of a
previous simple x equal to 0.

01:01:48.570 --> 01:01:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And because it's here, remember,
the x here is just the labels.

01:01:53.970 --> 01:01:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And so, for each
variable we require,

01:01:56.580 --> 01:02:00.390 align:middle line:84%
it's go to 0 at t
plus minus infinity.

01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:02.220 align:middle line:90%
You could do 0.

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And also, normally,
in field theory,

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:08.670 align:middle line:84%
we assume, yeah, in
order for the integral

01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:11.080 align:middle line:84%
to have well-defined
behavior, et cetera.

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:17.970 align:middle line:84%
We often just assume also go
to 0 in the spatial infinity.

01:02:17.970 --> 01:02:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this is just
often for convenience.

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And physically, this also
means that infinitely far away,

01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and we assume that the
field are not excited.

01:02:29.970 --> 01:02:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we are interested only in
the, yeah, physical excitations

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.040 align:middle line:90%
in finite region.

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so this is
the condition we

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.015 align:middle line:84%
impose when doing the path
integral in the field theory

01:02:41.015 --> 01:02:41.515 align:middle line:90%
case.

01:02:41.515 --> 01:02:45.270 align:middle line:90%


01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So now, again, you can introduce
a generating functional.

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.580 align:middle line:84%
You can just, again,
just copy notation,

01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:54.890 align:middle line:90%
copy the previous formula.

01:02:54.890 --> 01:02:57.290 align:middle line:90%
And by changing notation.

01:02:57.290 --> 01:03:23.600 align:middle line:90%


01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:28.300 align:middle line:84%
So now the generating
functional ZJ

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:36.550 align:middle line:84%
is defined to be D phi
exponential i S phi.

01:03:36.550 --> 01:03:39.340 align:middle line:90%
And then, now you just add--

01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:44.560 align:middle line:84%
now you integrate over all
space time points and phi x.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Again, we introduce a J.
But now you integrate over

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.090 align:middle line:90%
all space time points.

01:03:49.090 --> 01:03:52.380 align:middle line:90%


01:03:52.380 --> 01:04:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And then, similarly,
the ZJ divided by Z0,

01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:03.720 align:middle line:90%
so this we call--

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:09.780 align:middle line:84%
yeah, the Z0, again, is just
the integral without x, any x.

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So divided by Z0 is
equal to now the omega

01:04:18.550 --> 01:04:24.310 align:middle line:84%
and time-ordered product
of the exponential i.

01:04:24.310 --> 01:04:39.420 align:middle line:90%


01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:40.870 align:middle line:90%
So, again, just given by that.

01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And, again, this
time-ordered product,

01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:46.560 align:middle line:84%
time-ordered exponential
should be understood,

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:49.620 align:middle line:84%
as you expanded this
in power series,

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:51.340 align:middle line:84%
when you expand it
in power series,

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:53.010 align:middle line:90%
then you have powers of phi.

01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Then you just order those phis
in terms of time ordering.

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And then, again, the
integration and J

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:02.280 align:middle line:84%
can be pulled outside
this expectation value.

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:07.380 align:middle line:90%


01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Good?

01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And the Z0 is just the
same as ZJ equal to 0,

01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:26.670 align:middle line:90%
so without any J.

01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:29.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is, again, just
immediately give you

01:05:29.070 --> 01:05:32.190 align:middle line:84%
a general prescription
for calculating

01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:36.660 align:middle line:84%
n-point function in any
theory, in any scalar theory.

01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:39.180 align:middle line:84%
So, here, I don't
even have to specify

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:42.930 align:middle line:90%
the precise form of the action.

01:05:42.930 --> 01:05:45.330 align:middle line:90%
It just carry through.

01:05:45.330 --> 01:05:47.800 align:middle line:84%
This also applies to
interacting theory.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:50.680 align:middle line:84%
So this formula also applies
to interacting theory.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:56.920 align:middle line:90%
And, yeah, it's very general.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:01.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is the power, say, of
this path integral formalism.

01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:04.440 align:middle line:84%
So once you understand in
the quantum mechanics case,

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:07.530 align:middle line:84%
go to quantum field
theory is automatic.

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:12.410 align:middle line:90%


01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:12.980 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:15.230 align:middle line:84%
So now let's look
at how to treat--

01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:17.270 align:middle line:90%
how to do this thing--

01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:21.000 align:middle line:84%
calculate this thing
in field theory.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.550 align:middle line:84%
So, first, let's just look
at the free field theory.

01:06:23.550 --> 01:06:26.520 align:middle line:90%


01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:29.792 align:middle line:84%
And then, before we look
at the interacting case,

01:06:29.792 --> 01:06:31.500 align:middle line:84%
let's just look at
the free field theory.

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:34.850 align:middle line:90%


01:06:34.850 --> 01:06:38.870 align:middle line:84%
So free field theory is
almost identical, again,

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:42.230 align:middle line:84%
almost identical to the
harmonic oscillator case

01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:44.310 align:middle line:84%
because harmonic
oscillator is also--

01:06:44.310 --> 01:06:45.810 align:middle line:84%
because the free
theory will be also

01:06:45.810 --> 01:06:47.810 align:middle line:90%
a quadratic Gaussian integral.

01:06:47.810 --> 01:06:50.390 align:middle line:84%
So everything will be very
similar to the harmonic

01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:51.450 align:middle line:90%
oscillator case.

01:06:51.450 --> 01:06:55.220 align:middle line:84%
We just need to, again,
replace some notations.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.950 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's consider
the free field case.

01:06:57.950 --> 01:07:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Consider this minus 1/2
partial mu phi, partial mu phi,

01:07:05.030 --> 01:07:10.280 align:middle line:84%
minus 1/2 m square phi square
without any nonlinear--

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:14.830 align:middle line:84%
without any cubic or
higher power term.

01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And, again, the S
can be written--

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.380 align:middle line:90%
so S, in this case--

01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:22.650 align:middle line:84%
So, here, 0 means
the free theory

01:07:22.650 --> 01:07:27.030 align:middle line:84%
because later we will
do interacting theory.

01:07:27.030 --> 01:07:30.990 align:middle line:84%
So s, in this case, again,
you can write it as--

01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:34.230 align:middle line:90%
you can integration by part.

01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:44.245 align:middle line:84%
You can write it as d4x,
d4x prime, then phi x, Kx,

01:07:44.245 --> 01:07:46.995 align:middle line:90%
x prime, and then phi x prime.

01:07:46.995 --> 01:07:52.490 align:middle line:90%


01:07:52.490 --> 01:08:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And now, the K is
given by d squared

01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:06.080 align:middle line:90%
plus m squared minus epsilon.

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:08.540 align:middle line:84%
Again, this epsilon
comes from that thing.

01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:11.990 align:middle line:84%
You just, if you work
through, you just, yeah,

01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:13.670 align:middle line:90%
it just minus epsilon.

01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:17.720 align:middle line:90%
And then delta 4x minus x prime.

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:22.149 align:middle line:90%


01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:23.500 align:middle line:90%
And, yeah.

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:26.180 align:middle line:90%


01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:29.260 align:middle line:90%
So, again, we can just--

01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:35.590 align:middle line:84%
shorthand notation, so this has
a minus 1/2 phi dot K dot phi.

01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Just now, the only difference
is that you change it

01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:41.649 align:middle line:84%
from integration of dt,
integration of the full space

01:08:41.649 --> 01:08:43.060 align:middle line:90%
time.

01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, everything
else is the same.

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:46.740 align:middle line:90%
And.

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:47.729 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is ZJ.

01:08:47.729 --> 01:08:52.990 align:middle line:90%


01:08:52.990 --> 01:09:02.930 align:middle line:84%
ZJ just given by D phi
exponential, again,

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:04.449 align:middle line:84%
just given by a
Gaussian integral.

01:09:04.449 --> 01:09:09.620 align:middle line:90%


01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:16.890 align:middle line:84%
So let me see whether I can
squeeze in a Gaussian integral,

01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:22.830 align:middle line:84%
phi dot K dot phi,
then plus i J dot phi.

01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:28.090 align:middle line:84%
So we can, again, write this
in the simplified notation

01:09:28.090 --> 01:09:29.325 align:middle line:90%
as i J dot phi.

01:09:29.325 --> 01:09:32.149 align:middle line:90%


01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:34.640 align:middle line:90%
So, again, you just--

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.200 align:middle line:90%
and then you find this--

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:41.540 align:middle line:84%
you get some other C. Again,
you get determinant K.

01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
exponential i over 2 J K1 J.

01:09:49.670 --> 01:09:52.290 align:middle line:84%
So everything is
exactly the same.

01:09:52.290 --> 01:09:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And then, this is the
same as Z0, this part.

01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:59.588 align:middle line:90%
And then, again, they cancel.

01:09:59.588 --> 01:10:00.380 align:middle line:90%
Again, they cancel.

01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:05.410 align:middle line:90%


01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:06.925 align:middle line:90%
So, again, we find--

01:10:06.925 --> 01:10:23.030 align:middle line:90%


01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:27.182 align:middle line:84%
so, in this case, again,
we find that K minus 1 x,

01:10:27.182 --> 01:10:33.230 align:middle line:84%
x prime equal to
i GF x, x prime.

01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:39.560 align:middle line:84%
So this i epsilon prescription,
so it's precisely, yeah,

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:43.790 align:middle line:84%
if you check the definition, so
this i epsilon prescription m

01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:45.650 align:middle line:84%
square goes to m
squared minus epsilon,

01:10:45.650 --> 01:10:48.470 align:middle line:84%
is also the precisely
what we did before

01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:51.470 align:middle line:90%
for the Feynman function.

01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:56.630 align:middle line:90%


01:10:56.630 --> 01:11:05.140 align:middle line:84%
So, now, the final answer,
the ZJ divide by Z0,

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:08.260 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I almost don't
want to copy it.

01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:11.240 align:middle line:84%
It's just exactly
the same as this.

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:17.410 align:middle line:84%
You just replace the dt
integral by d4x x integral.

01:11:17.410 --> 01:11:20.140 align:middle line:90%
And the d4x integral.

01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:23.320 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah, let me just write it.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:26.870 align:middle line:90%


01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:43.735 align:middle line:84%
Exponential minus 1/2, then J
GF J. Any questions on this?

01:11:43.735 --> 01:11:51.320 align:middle line:90%


01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And, again, if you
calculate n-point function,

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:59.780 align:middle line:84%
then you just get the
identical structure as here.

01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Just the identical
structure here.

01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:08.740 align:middle line:84%
The only difference is that you
replace GF, t1, t2 by x1, x2,

01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:09.940 align:middle line:90%
x3, x4, et cetera.

01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:12.430 align:middle line:90%
Everything is just identical.

01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:15.490 align:middle line:84%
So, to save time, I will
not copy them again.

01:12:15.490 --> 01:12:16.565 align:middle line:90%
So, do you have-- yeah.

01:12:16.565 --> 01:12:18.190 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So in this
particular theory,

01:12:18.190 --> 01:12:20.800 align:middle line:84%
do we have the condition
that phi goes to 0

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:23.302 align:middle line:90%
when t goes to infinity?

01:12:23.302 --> 01:12:24.010 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

01:12:24.010 --> 01:12:25.677 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: In this
particular theory, Do.

01:12:25.677 --> 01:12:30.020 align:middle line:84%
We have the condition
that phi goes to 0?

01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:33.890 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so that ensures,

01:12:33.890 --> 01:12:36.470 align:middle line:84%
when you do integration
by parts, everything is 0.

01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:38.810 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: We have
the solution for phi?

01:12:38.810 --> 01:12:40.070 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:41.810 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: We know
the solution for phi

01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:45.320 align:middle line:84%
in terms of x and t right,
and it's like a plane wave?

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:48.305 align:middle line:90%


01:12:48.305 --> 01:12:50.180 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, this is
the boundary condition

01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:51.930 align:middle line:90%
in your path integral.

01:12:51.930 --> 01:12:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this is the
boundary condition

01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:55.140 align:middle line:90%
in your path integral.

01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:56.470 align:middle line:90%
We're not talking about this.

01:12:56.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this is--
yeah, phi just the--

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:04.470 align:middle line:84%
yeah, here, I didn't write down
any explicit solution for phi.

01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:05.320 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:08.802 align:middle line:84%
What plane wave we
are talking about?

01:13:08.802 --> 01:13:11.260 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Oh, I was thinking
about the solution for all phi

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:14.480 align:middle line:84%
field theory that we
did a few lectures ago.

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:15.530 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:17.157 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: So that [INAUDIBLE]?

01:13:17.157 --> 01:13:17.990 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, no.

01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:20.420 align:middle line:90%
No, that will also go to 0.

01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:21.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, no, no, no.

01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:23.060 align:middle line:90%
That's an operator equation.

01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:24.050 align:middle line:90%
That's an operator.

01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Here, it's just the field
in your path integral.

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:30.510 align:middle line:84%
So, here, you just
integrate over all possible.

01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:35.000 align:middle line:84%
There, when we write that,
that's an operator equation

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.690 align:middle line:90%
with a and a dagger there.

01:13:36.690 --> 01:13:40.230 align:middle line:84%
So here is just the ordinary
function of space time,

01:13:40.230 --> 01:13:45.066 align:middle line:84%
which we impose the boundary
condition in the path integral.

01:13:45.066 --> 01:13:45.566 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:13:45.566 --> 01:13:52.380 align:middle line:90%


01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And, similarly, in here, there's
Wick theorem, just everything

01:13:58.130 --> 01:13:59.390 align:middle line:90%
just goes through.

01:13:59.390 --> 01:14:00.620 align:middle line:90%
Everything just goes through.

01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:03.330 align:middle line:90%


01:14:03.330 --> 01:14:03.830 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:06.570 align:middle line:90%


01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:07.820 align:middle line:90%
Any other questions?

01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:12.160 align:middle line:90%


01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:15.310 align:middle line:84%
So, for the last
few minutes, then we

01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:19.510 align:middle line:84%
can venture a little bit
into the interacting case.

01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:22.360 align:middle line:90%
Was there any question?

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.290 align:middle line:84%
So now we can venture
into interactions.

01:14:26.290 --> 01:14:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So now we have our
master formula.

01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And now we can treat what
happens in the interaction

01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:32.320 align:middle line:90%
case.

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:36.440 align:middle line:90%


01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.090 align:middle line:84%
So now we can go to
interacting theory.

01:14:38.090 --> 01:14:45.200 align:middle line:90%


01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:48.500 align:middle line:84%
So in the interacting
theory, let's just

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:54.140 align:middle line:84%
consider, say, the case
which L equal to L0,

01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:57.560 align:middle line:90%
then you pass some polynomial.

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.780 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
simplest case is

01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:04.730 align:middle line:84%
just lambda we discussed
before to the phi 4.

01:15:04.730 --> 01:15:08.780 align:middle line:90%
So plus some higher power term.

01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:11.150 align:middle line:84%
So, for simplicity,
I will just--

01:15:11.150 --> 01:15:14.310 align:middle line:84%
but what we will do, we will
not depend on details form.

01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:15.980 align:middle line:90%
Let me just write LI.

01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you have some
interacting terms.

01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:22.450 align:middle line:84%
So, in this particular case,
the LI is equal to that.

01:15:22.450 --> 01:15:24.200 align:middle line:84%
But we can consider
the more general case.

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Just you have some extra,
yeah, something depend on phi.

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:35.140 align:middle line:90%


01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And, similarly, your
Hamiltonian will also

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:43.360 align:middle line:84%
be the free theory Hamiltonian
plus a interacting one.

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:46.990 align:middle line:90%


01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And the interacting one--
so let's, for simplicity,

01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:52.900 align:middle line:84%
then this LI, as in this
case, only depend on phi,

01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:57.580 align:middle line:84%
does not depend on the, say,
the time derivative of phi.

01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:00.440 align:middle line:84%
So if it does not depend on
the time derivative of phi,

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:09.820 align:middle line:84%
and then, essentially, LI, HI is
essentially just minus d3x LI.

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:12.310 align:middle line:84%
When you do the
Legendre transform

01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:16.780 align:middle line:84%
to go from, say, L to H,
don't change this term

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:20.420 align:middle line:84%
if it does not contain
time derivative.

01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:21.760 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.770 align:middle line:84%
So, and then, there's
a very simple relation

01:16:23.770 --> 01:16:26.530 align:middle line:84%
between this interacting
term in the Lagrangian

01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:29.960 align:middle line:90%
and also in the Hamiltonian.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is a free
theory Hamiltonian.

01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And now we will write
our total action

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:42.185 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the free theory
part and the interacting part.

01:16:42.185 --> 01:16:46.880 align:middle line:90%


01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And the interacting part
is just given by d4 x LI.

01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:59.720 align:middle line:84%
It's also the same
as minus dt HI.

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:11.110 align:middle line:90%


01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.920 align:middle line:90%
Good?

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:14.680 align:middle line:90%
So just to set it up.

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:16.390 align:middle line:90%
And now we want to calculate.

01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Again, we want to calculate
this n-point function.

01:17:20.250 --> 01:17:23.100 align:middle line:90%
Which did I erase it?

01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:26.483 align:middle line:84%
Again, we want to calculate
this n-point function.

01:17:26.483 --> 01:17:28.275 align:middle line:84%
So this is the object
we are interested in.

01:17:28.275 --> 01:17:32.270 align:middle line:90%


01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And, again, we can just
consider generating functional.

01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And we can consider
generating functional.

01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:45.650 align:middle line:90%


01:17:45.650 --> 01:17:46.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Before, actually, we do
that, let's just consider--

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.400 align:middle line:84%
yeah, let's just consider
this n-point function.

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:56.290 align:middle line:90%


01:17:56.290 --> 01:17:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we actually
have one minute.

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:02.000 align:middle line:90%
We cannot do really much.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Let me just tell
you the basic idea.

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:08.875 align:middle line:84%
And then we will
elaborate next time.

01:18:08.875 --> 01:18:11.770 align:middle line:90%


01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:15.790 align:middle line:84%
So, now, let's imagine we
want to compute this object.

01:18:15.790 --> 01:18:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Again, we just use
that formula, this Gn

01:18:22.150 --> 01:18:26.650 align:middle line:84%
is equal to D phi
X exponential i

01:18:26.650 --> 01:18:36.250 align:middle line:84%
S divided by D phi exponential
i S. So now, what I will do

01:18:36.250 --> 01:18:37.060 align:middle line:90%
is, I will--

01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:43.100 align:middle line:84%
now, my S-- so the
idea is the following.

01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, this part,
integrals are not doable.

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Because once you have
these non-polynomial terms,

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:56.240 align:middle line:84%
or non-quadratic terms, we don't
know how to do the integral.

01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:57.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how to
do this integral even

01:18:57.990 --> 01:19:03.550 align:middle line:90%
for one-dimensional integral.

01:19:03.550 --> 01:19:06.100 align:middle line:84%
So not to mention
the path integral.

01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:08.160 align:middle line:84%
We also don't know how
to do such integral

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:10.570 align:middle line:90%
for a harmonic oscillator.

01:19:10.570 --> 01:19:12.200 align:middle line:90%
But, yeah, same thing.

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:14.350 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how to
do it for field theory.

01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:16.822 align:middle line:84%
So, as we said
before, even though we

01:19:16.822 --> 01:19:18.280 align:middle line:84%
don't know how to
do this integral,

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.640 align:middle line:84%
we can treat this
perturbatively.

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:22.980 align:middle line:90%
So we treat this as a main term.

01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And then we treat
the lambda small,

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:27.630 align:middle line:84%
then we try to expand the
power series of lambda.

01:19:27.630 --> 01:19:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And now we can write the path
integral as the following.

01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:40.600 align:middle line:84%
D phi x, then we
add S 0, then i SI,

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:47.980 align:middle line:84%
and then divided by D phi,
exponential i S0 plus i SI.

01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And, now, what we
are going to do

01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:51.865 align:middle line:84%
is, we just expand this
term in power series.

01:19:51.865 --> 01:19:54.410 align:middle line:90%


01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:57.930 align:middle line:84%
When we expanded
this in power series,

01:19:57.930 --> 01:20:00.330 align:middle line:84%
and then, essentially,
we are reducing it

01:20:00.330 --> 01:20:03.640 align:middle line:84%
to the path integral
of the free theory.

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:06.310 align:middle line:84%
So, essentially, the
upstairs and downstairs

01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:10.420 align:middle line:84%
can be imagined as we are
doing the free theory-- now

01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:11.695 align:middle line:90%
this is a free theory vacuum.

01:20:11.695 --> 01:20:18.820 align:middle line:90%


01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:22.450 align:middle line:84%
We can just view this as an
integrand of exponential i0.

01:20:22.450 --> 01:20:25.360 align:middle line:90%
So the upstairs just become--

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:29.460 align:middle line:90%
so this just become the--

01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:38.280 align:middle line:84%
yeah, t x exponential i
SI, now in the free theory.

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:42.075 align:middle line:84%
And then, downstairs also
become 0 t exponential i

01:20:42.075 --> 01:20:44.100 align:middle line:90%
SI in the free theory.

01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:47.220 align:middle line:90%


01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And now we can just
evaluate, in the free theory,

01:20:50.010 --> 01:20:52.560 align:middle line:84%
such kind of
correlation functions.

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And we evaluate
them by expanding

01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:59.850 align:middle line:90%
the SI in power series.

01:20:59.850 --> 01:21:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And then just-- so
everything becomes

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:07.650 align:middle line:84%
just doing some Taylor
series expansion

01:21:07.650 --> 01:21:13.410 align:middle line:84%
in the inside of the integral
and then become very simple.

01:21:13.410 --> 01:21:15.600 align:middle line:90%
You don't need any fancy stuff.

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:18.930 align:middle line:84%
First year your
calculus you can do.

01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:21.780 align:middle line:90%
First year calculus you can do.

01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:23.850 align:middle line:84%
So when you expand
that stuff, still you

01:21:23.850 --> 01:21:26.080 align:middle line:90%
get something very complicated.

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you can use
diagrammatic rules

01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:29.370 align:middle line:90%
to simplify them.

01:21:29.370 --> 01:21:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's called
the Feynman diagrams.

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And now we can--
yeah, next time we

01:21:33.090 --> 01:21:37.050 align:middle line:84%
will talk about Feynman
diagrams to simplify such kind

01:21:37.050 --> 01:21:39.620 align:middle line:90%
of expansion in power series.

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:44.000 align:middle line:90%
