00:00:06.396 --> 00:00:10.340 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.255 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, so, today, we
are going to start a new topic.

00:00:14.255 --> 00:00:30.790 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.290 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.210 align:middle line:84%
So, first, we talk
about chiral fermions.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:41.560 align:middle line:90%


00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:84%
So remember, say, under
Lorentz transformation,

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:04.840 align:middle line:84%
lambda, the Dirac spinor fields
transform as S lambda psi x.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And the x prime is a
Lorentz transformation of x.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.500 align:middle line:84%
So x prime is
lambda act on x, OK?

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.060 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And then the S is given by, say,
omega mu nu, sigma, mu, nu, OK?

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And the sigma mu, nu is driven
by the commutator of the gamma

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.100 align:middle line:90%
matrices.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.390 align:middle line:90%
So let me just write it down.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.400 align:middle line:90%
So sigma mu, nu--

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.400 align:middle line:84%
just remind you--
i divided by 4.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.040 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.610 align:middle line:90%
So one natural question--

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.600 align:middle line:84%
so, previously, when we
derived the Dirac equation,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.120 align:middle line:84%
we showed that the Dirac
equation requires, actually,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.835 align:middle line:90%
psi to have four components, OK?

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:11.990 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.570 align:middle line:84%
But, then, we showed that the
Dirac equation is covariant

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.920 align:middle line:90%
if the psi transform this way.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.590 align:middle line:84%
So natural question is that
whether you can actually

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.010 align:middle line:90%
restrict to a smaller part--

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.690 align:middle line:90%
say, to a subset of psi--

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.580 align:middle line:84%
whether they still have
well-defined Lorentz

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.290 align:middle line:84%
transformation,
whether we actually

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.980 align:middle line:84%
need to have four components
to have well-defined--

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.440 align:middle line:84%
four complex component to
have well-defined Lorentz

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.660 align:middle line:90%
transformation, OK?

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And the answer turns out
to be, no, you actually

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.080 align:middle line:84%
don't need to have
four complex components

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.360 align:middle line:84%
to have well-defined
Lorentz transformation.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.650 align:middle line:90%
Actually, you can reduce it, OK?

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And so there are two
ways to reduce it,

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.610 align:middle line:84%
and one is called
chiral fermion,

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and the one is called
the Majorana fermion, OK?

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.830 align:middle line:84%
So one is called the
Majorana fermion.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.070 align:middle line:84%
So we first talk about the
chiral fermion and one way

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.700 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.310 align:middle line:84%
So, for this
purpose, we will look

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.120 align:middle line:84%
at the specific representation
of gamma matrices, OK?

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Consider-- so now I will use
a representation which is

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.930 align:middle line:90%
different from what you--

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.350 align:middle line:84%
so we consider
the following one.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.660 align:middle line:90%
Gamma 0 equal to 0, i, i, 0.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Gamma i equal to 0 minus
i sigma i, i sigma i.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.010 align:middle line:90%


00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at this choice
of gamma matrices, OK?

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.500 align:middle line:84%
So I will call this
choice to be star, OK?

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.410 align:middle line:90%
And so you can also work it out.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.450 align:middle line:90%
You find the sigma.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.340 align:middle line:90%
So sigma 0, i--

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.560 align:middle line:84%
so this is the sigma
corresponding to the boost.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:84%
So you find the sigma i, you
can just do the commutator.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.790 align:middle line:84%
From the sigma i is equal
to minus i divided by 2,

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.170 align:middle line:90%
have this block diagonal form.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Sigma i 0, 0 sigma i--
again, the small sigma i

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.130 align:middle line:90%
is always the Pauli matrices.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And then you can also
work out the sigma ij.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Then you find the is
given by minus 1/2,

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:46.590 align:middle line:84%
epsilon ijk, then sigma
k, 0, 0, sigma k, OK?

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.110 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sorry.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.140 align:middle line:90%
Here, there's a minus sign.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.190 align:middle line:90%
OK, here, there's a minus sign.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you find that they
have the following form.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So what do you
observe about this?

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.320 align:middle line:90%


00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.570 align:middle line:90%
So do you see something?

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:09.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.475 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: They're
block diagonal.

00:05:10.475 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yes, they
are block diagonal.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.100 align:middle line:84%
So if sigma is block
diagonal, then that

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.640 align:middle line:84%
means this S is also
block diagonal, OK?

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So when S is block diagonal,
what does that mean?

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:30.350 align:middle line:90%


00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.557 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:05:31.557 --> 00:05:33.409 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.992 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Hmm?

00:05:33.992 --> 00:05:34.970 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.790 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Exactly.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So when the S is block diagonal,
that means, when I write psi--

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.750 align:middle line:90%
so, psi-- have four components.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.720 align:middle line:84%
That means that the upper two
component and the lower two

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.940 align:middle line:84%
components-- they don't
transform to each other, OK?

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.590 align:middle line:84%
They only transform
within themselves.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.080 align:middle line:84%
They don't transform
to each other, OK?

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:02.135 align:middle line:84%
So if I choose, that means
this lambda is block diagonal.

00:06:02.135 --> 00:06:06.290 align:middle line:90%


00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:16.751 align:middle line:84%
So that means, if I write psi x
into two component vector, psi

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:21.560 align:middle line:84%
L and psi R, so I denote the
upper two components by psi L

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.956 align:middle line:84%
and lower two
components by psi R--

00:06:24.956 --> 00:06:31.900 align:middle line:84%
are two component
complex vector.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.980 align:middle line:90%


00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:47.010 align:middle line:84%
That means, under Lorentz
transformation, under S lambda,

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.760 align:middle line:90%
psi L and psi R do not mix.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.690 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.540 align:middle line:84%
So they just transform
among themselves.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.190 align:middle line:84%
They just transform
among themselves.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.460 align:middle line:84%
So they actually have
well-defined Lorentz

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.610 align:middle line:84%
transformation as
a smaller unit, OK?

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.860 align:middle line:84%
You don't need four components
to be able to transform

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.068 align:middle line:90%
under Lorentz transformation.

00:07:09.068 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Actually, at least
two components

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.380 align:middle line:90%
can already transform.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:32.500 align:middle line:84%
So this tells you, in a sense
that the Lorentz covariance

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:39.850 align:middle line:84%
only requires two
component spinors.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.690 align:middle line:90%


00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Just by Lorentz
transformation itself,

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.410 align:middle line:84%
you don't actually
need four components.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.390 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:54.108 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.108 --> 00:07:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So, now, I'm going to
tell you, we actually

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.000 align:middle line:90%
knew this all along.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.060 align:middle line:84%
So how did we know
this all along?

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.030 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Why is
there no [INAUDIBLE]??

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:15.883 align:middle line:90%


00:08:15.883 --> 00:08:16.550 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:17.745 align:middle line:90%
Say it again.

00:08:17.745 --> 00:08:21.511 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Didn't we have to
go to four components in there

00:08:21.511 --> 00:08:26.435 align:middle line:84%
because there are no
representation [INAUDIBLE]??

00:08:26.435 --> 00:08:27.310 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:30.760 align:middle line:84%
We have to go to four
components because there's

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:36.730 align:middle line:84%
no two component representation
of the gamma matrices.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.610 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't say it's
a Lorentz transformation.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:40.299 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:43.330 align:middle line:84%
To write down the algebra
for the gamma matrices,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.040 align:middle line:90%
you need four components.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.060 align:middle line:84%
But we actually knew all
along that two components

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:54.340 align:middle line:84%
is enough for Lorentz
transformation.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.440 align:middle line:84%
How do we actually
know all along?

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.495 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Lorentz assumption
isn't just [INAUDIBLE] spin

00:09:00.495 --> 00:09:03.710 align:middle line:84%
like difference between
the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.380 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, this is
maybe more complicated.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.240 align:middle line:90%
We have something much simpler.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.407 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:09.407 --> 00:09:10.990 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is it the
massless particle?

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.460 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:17.020 align:middle line:84%
So we already said before, if
you have a massless case when

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.870 align:middle line:84%
m equal to 0, and
the Dirac equation

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:23.790 align:middle line:84%
reduces to the two
components, and it's

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.460 align:middle line:84%
enough to do two components,
and the Dirac equation

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.810 align:middle line:90%
is covariant, OK?

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And so that means
that, actually, you

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.920 align:middle line:84%
should be able to do it
with two components, OK?

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.503 align:middle line:84%
Because the massless
particle-- they

00:09:33.503 --> 00:09:35.920 align:middle line:84%
should be able to transform
on the Lorentz transformation.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.530 align:middle line:90%
And so, yeah.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:44.660 align:middle line:90%


00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:49.100 align:middle line:84%
So we already saw this
because the massless.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So the hint from before
is that the massless only

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:06.470 align:middle line:90%
require two components.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.690 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Since the massless
case must also be

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.295 align:middle line:90%
Lorentz covariant so that--

00:10:13.295 --> 00:10:14.930 align:middle line:84%
and Lorentz symmetry
itself should only

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.830 align:middle line:90%
require two components.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.660 align:middle line:84%
So it is not a Lorentz
symmetry, actually.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Lorentz covariance
requires Dirac theory

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.440 align:middle line:90%
to have four component.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.990 align:middle line:90%
It is the mass, OK?

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.310 align:middle line:90%
So it is the mass--

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:33.620 align:middle line:90%


00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.090 align:middle line:90%
mass m.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:39.170 align:middle line:84%
If you want to describe
a massive particle,

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.170 align:middle line:84%
then you must have
four components, OK?

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.690 align:middle line:84%
So it is the mass
which is the key.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:11:03.650 align:middle line:90%


00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:04.710 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:05.735 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:11:05.735 --> 00:11:13.220 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:18.590 align:middle line:84%
So, now, we have shown in
this particular representation

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.780 align:middle line:84%
of gamma matrices, for
this particular choice

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:28.330 align:middle line:84%
of gamma matrices, and then the
psi transform block diagonally.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle line:84%
But then we also said, but,
now, consider a different choice

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.450 align:middle line:90%
of gamma matrices.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And then this property
will not hold, OK?

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:40.780 align:middle line:90%
This property will not hold.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, the question
is that, does this--

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.440 align:middle line:84%
even with other gamma
matrices, can we actually

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.450 align:middle line:84%
reduce psi to some
smaller components?

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.390 align:middle line:84%
The answer still
should still be yes

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:58.410 align:middle line:84%
because we said that all
representation of gamma

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.370 align:middle line:90%
matrices should be equivalent.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.960 align:middle line:84%
So if we can do it in this
choice of gamma matrices,

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.870 align:middle line:84%
then we should be able to
do it in any choice of gamma

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.720 align:middle line:90%
matrices, OK?

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.580 align:middle line:84%
So, now, let me tell you how
to do it for the general gamma

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.080 align:middle line:90%
matrices.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:17.120 align:middle line:90%


00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:26.030 align:middle line:84%
So this property that you
can reduce to two components

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:39.360 align:middle line:84%
should exist for all
choice of gamma matrices.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.230 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Just for other choice
of gamma matrices,

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:84%
to separate the psi into psi
L and psi R is more subtle.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.670 align:middle line:84%
You no longer-- is just
simple the upper two component

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:57.970 align:middle line:90%
or lower two component.

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:02.040 align:middle line:84%
So we have to do a
little bit of work, OK?

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we don't need to
do much work if you actually

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:09.630 align:middle line:90%
find the right trick, OK?

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And so the beautiful
trick to do this

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.320 align:middle line:84%
for any choice of
gamma matrices is

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.195 align:middle line:84%
that you can introduce
the following object--

00:13:18.195 --> 00:13:23.610 align:middle line:90%


00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:24.855 align:middle line:90%
what is called gamma 5.

00:13:24.855 --> 00:13:28.840 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:35.170 align:middle line:84%
So gamma 5 is defined to be
i gamma 0, gamma 1, gamma

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.180 align:middle line:90%
2, gamma 3, OK?

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:40.210 align:middle line:84%
So you take the product
of all the gamma

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:46.860 align:middle line:84%
matrices together and then
with a factor of i, OK?

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So the i there is for
the purpose that if you--

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.980 align:middle line:90%
you can check yourself--

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.760 align:middle line:84%
that the gamma 5 is
actually Hermitian.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So the i is there
for this purpose, OK?

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.020 align:middle line:90%
You need i for this to be true.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:13.280 align:middle line:84%
You also can check yourself that
gamma 5 squared is equal to 1,

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.620 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:20.000 align:middle line:84%
So, this, you can almost
easily understand because it's

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.460 align:middle line:90%
all gamma 0, gamma 1, gamma 3.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:26.990 align:middle line:84%
So you multiply itself again
because any same gamma matrix,

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.020 align:middle line:84%
they multiply
either 1 or minus 1.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.360 align:middle line:84%
So you multiply them
together, in the end,

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.950 align:middle line:90%
they can be either 1 or minus 1.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Just turns out, for this
choice of i, it's 1, OK?

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.470 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And then you can also check
the gamma 5 anticommute

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.115 align:middle line:90%
with any gamma matrices.

00:14:46.115 --> 00:14:49.070 align:middle line:90%


00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So mu here is, of
course, from 0 to 3.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.550 align:middle line:90%


00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:59.120 align:middle line:90%
And so this is of--

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.668 align:middle line:84%
you can see
immediately from here--

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:03.960 align:middle line:90%
you can immediately from here--

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:10.630 align:middle line:84%
because gamma matrices whose
indices are not the same,

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.660 align:middle line:90%
they anticommute, OK?

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:17.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you try to commute
this with any gamma matrices,

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:18.870 align:middle line:90%
you have three of them.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.600 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because this runs
over all gamma matrices.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So the one in which-- yeah, so
if you take with some gamma mu,

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.220 align:middle line:84%
and that particular
one, which is

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.590 align:middle line:84%
the same as gamma mu, of
course, commutes with gamma mu.

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:35.270 align:middle line:90%
But then you have three others.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:39.140 align:middle line:84%
But three others will
give you minus sign, OK?

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.730 align:middle line:90%
And you can also check yourself.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:43.590 align:middle line:90%


00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:46.248 align:middle line:84%
Gamma 5 actually
have 0 trace, OK?

00:15:46.248 --> 00:15:47.790 align:middle line:84%
So, this, I will
leave as an exercise

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:54.215 align:middle line:84%
for yourself, what you can do
is you did before with other--

00:15:54.215 --> 00:15:56.990 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:00.230 align:middle line:90%
yeah, in your homework--

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:middle line:84%
yeah, similar to the exercise
you have done in your homework.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.590 align:middle line:90%
So, now, from this properties--

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.410 align:middle line:84%
now we can say the following
things about the gamma 5

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:10.610 align:middle line:90%
matrix.

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:17.900 align:middle line:84%
First, because gamma 5
squared, squared to 1.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.820 align:middle line:90%
And, also, this is Hermitian.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:25.300 align:middle line:84%
So it is Hermitian means its
eigenvalue is all real, OK?

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.510 align:middle line:84%
So its eigenvalues are
all real, and gamma 5

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:84%
squared equal to 1-- that
means its eigenvalue is either

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.190 align:middle line:90%
plus or minus 1, OK?

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:40.190 align:middle line:84%
So have eigenvalues
plus, minus 1.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:44.070 align:middle line:90%


00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And then from the property
that this is traceless,

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:51.220 align:middle line:84%
they tell you the number of the
eigenvalues, which is plus 1,

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.970 align:middle line:90%
and the number of minus 1.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.740 align:middle line:90%
They should be the same.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.110 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, they won't cancel.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:57.370 align:middle line:90%
It won't be traceless.

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:01.838 align:middle line:84%
And so each eigenspace
is two-dimensional.

00:17:01.838 --> 00:17:08.530 align:middle line:90%


00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.160 align:middle line:90%
So you have four eigenvalues.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.980 align:middle line:90%
So there's 2 plus 1, 2 minus 1.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:14.760 align:middle line:90%
It must be.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.859 align:middle line:90%


00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:22.040 align:middle line:84%
So since you have eigenvalues
2 plus 1, 2 minus 1,

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.180 align:middle line:84%
and then we can introduce
a projector to project

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.970 align:middle line:84%
into the eigenspace,
say, with plus 1--

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:32.420 align:middle line:84%
with eigenvalue plus 1 or
the eigenvalue minus 1, OK?

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:37.400 align:middle line:84%
So I can introduce a projector
which, for historical reasons,

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.760 align:middle line:90%
is called PL.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.530 align:middle line:84%
It's defined to be
1/2 1 plus gamma 5.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And the PR is 1/2 1
minus gamma 5, OK?

00:17:53.530 --> 00:18:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So this will project into
eigenspace with the eigenvalue

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.900 align:middle line:90%
plus 1 squared.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And this will project into an
eigenspace with a minus 1, OK?

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.630 align:middle line:90%
Because when 1 minus 1 plus--

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.970 align:middle line:90%
yeah, anyway.

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:12.530 align:middle line:90%
So you can check, OK?

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:17.100 align:middle line:90%


00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.990 align:middle line:84%
So you can check they
are really projectors.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:24.060 align:middle line:84%
So PL squared equal to
PR squared equal to 1

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:30.990 align:middle line:84%
and PLPR equal to 0 and PL
plus PR equal to identity, OK?

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:34.460 align:middle line:90%


00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:39.220 align:middle line:90%
And then-- OK.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:43.340 align:middle line:90%


00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.200 align:middle line:90%
So, now, I introduce--

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:51.020 align:middle line:90%


00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.810 align:middle line:90%
now I can project--

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:59.510 align:middle line:84%
define the projection of psi L
of the projection of PL psi--

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:03.500 align:middle line:90%
project to the left space, OK?

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And psi R to be the
projection to the other space.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.770 align:middle line:90%


00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:11.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:13.890 align:middle line:90%
I define them this way.

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And then you can easily
see, by definition,

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.870 align:middle line:84%
you can easily convince
yourself gamma 5 acting on psi

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.990 align:middle line:84%
then just equal to psi
L. And the gamma 5 psi

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:28.940 align:middle line:90%
R is equal to minus psi R, OK?

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.240 align:middle line:84%
So they project into the
eigenvalues of plus, minus 1.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:32.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:33.890 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Wait,
why is PL squared

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.170 align:middle line:90%
equal to PR squared plus 1?

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:37.720 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.830 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Oh, sorry.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:40.700 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:41.530 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:42.586 align:middle line:90%
This is good.

00:19:42.586 --> 00:19:45.250 align:middle line:90%


00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.200 align:middle line:90%
This is completely wrong, OK?

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.250 align:middle line:90%
This is completely wrong.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.350 align:middle line:90%
I was dreaming.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:56.450 align:middle line:84%
So PL squared equal
to PL, PR squared.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:57.020 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:57.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, thank you.

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:02.160 align:middle line:90%


00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.455 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so you can check
their projectors, OK?

00:20:04.455 --> 00:20:09.550 align:middle line:90%


00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:11.830 align:middle line:90%
So, indeed, you see--

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.610 align:middle line:84%
so, from here, from
this definition,

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:15.190 align:middle line:90%
you can check this is true, OK?

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.530 align:middle line:90%
This is a one-second check.

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And so, indeed, they project
to the eigenspace of gamma 5

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.910 align:middle line:90%
or plus, minus 1.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:26.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:90%
So then, by definition--

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now this
psi L, psi R, which

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:37.180 align:middle line:84%
is now defined for any
choice of gamma matrices--

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:56.155 align:middle line:84%
so, again, they have to two
independent complex component,

00:20:56.155 --> 00:20:56.655 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:56.655 --> 00:21:08.270 align:middle line:90%


00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And so they call
the chiral spinors--

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.590 align:middle line:90%


00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.480 align:middle line:84%
sometimes also
called Weyl spinors.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.830 align:middle line:90%


00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
analog of psi L and psi R

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:32.790 align:middle line:84%
here for the general
choice of gamma matrices.

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So, now, we will check
this actually, indeed.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.400 align:middle line:84%
So now the claim is
that psi L and psi R

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.555 align:middle line:84%
defined this way will
transform under themselves

00:21:42.555 --> 00:21:43.930 align:middle line:84%
under the Lorentz
transformation.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.660 align:middle line:84%
They will not mix
with each other, OK?

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:52.970 align:middle line:84%
So, again, psi L and psi R here
each have four components, OK?

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:57.080 align:middle line:84%
They just have only two
independent compact components.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.860 align:middle line:84%
So they still have four
complex components, OK?

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And there's still
four component spinors

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:06.850 align:middle line:84%
because just there's only
two independent ones.

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:10.300 align:middle line:84%
There's only two
independent ones.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:15.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, so, now, it's easy to
check they actually transform

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:16.790 align:middle line:90%
among themselves.

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So you can check the
gamma 5 actually commutes

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.355 align:middle line:90%
with sigma mu, nu.

00:22:29.355 --> 00:22:34.650 align:middle line:90%


00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:35.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:39.660 align:middle line:90%


00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.475 align:middle line:90%
So this is very easy to see.

00:22:41.475 --> 00:22:44.470 align:middle line:90%


00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:48.510 align:middle line:84%
So, from here, gamma 5
commutes with any gamma

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:54.890 align:middle line:84%
mu or anticommute
with any gamma mu.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And the sigma mu, nu is
just the sum of two--

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.260 align:middle line:90%
the product of two gamma mus--

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.220 align:middle line:90%
have even gamma mus.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:06.460 align:middle line:84%
So the gamma 5 will
compete with them, OK?

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.120 align:middle line:84%
So gamma 5 will
commute with them.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.210 align:middle line:84%
So if gamma 5 commutes
with sigma mu, nu,

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:13.480 align:middle line:84%
then gamma 5 commutes
with S lambda

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:18.530 align:middle line:84%
because S lambda just
generated by sigma mu, nu.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:19.535 align:middle line:90%
And then that means--

00:23:19.535 --> 00:23:22.060 align:middle line:90%


00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.360 align:middle line:84%
so we commute with
S. That means,

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:28.823 align:middle line:84%
under transformation,
S will not--

00:23:28.823 --> 00:23:30.240 align:middle line:84%
under transformation
by S will not

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.550 align:middle line:84%
change the eigenvalues
of gamma 5, OK?

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:41.640 align:middle line:84%
So that means that psi L prime,
S lambda, psi L, and gamma

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:47.400 align:middle line:84%
5 acting on psi L
prime is still gamma L.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's still within
the same space.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.880 align:middle line:90%


00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.960 align:middle line:90%
And, similarly, we say--

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.340 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that tells you
that psi L and psi

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:00.910 align:middle line:84%
R-- they transform separately
because the gamma 5 commutes

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:05.350 align:middle line:90%
with Lorentz transformation.

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And so each eigenspace,
they transform separately

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:09.520 align:middle line:90%
from each other.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:15.420 align:middle line:90%


00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:15.920 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.837 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:24:16.837 --> 00:24:19.220 align:middle line:90%


00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:23.360 align:middle line:90%
So you can also find in the--

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:34.180 align:middle line:84%
so in the chiral representation,
you can check in this star--

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.090 align:middle line:84%
so the star-- this
particular choice of gamma

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:40.330 align:middle line:84%
is called the chiral
representation, OK?

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Because in that
choice of gamma--

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:46.060 align:middle line:84%
things simplify, we just
have upper two components

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:47.570 align:middle line:90%
and lower two components.

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:54.280 align:middle line:84%
So you can check yourself,
just by working it out,

00:24:54.280 --> 00:25:04.510 align:middle line:84%
that the gamma 5 indeed just
have block diagonal form--

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:07.750 align:middle line:90%
1, 0, 0 minus 1, OK?

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:08.830 align:middle line:90%
So that's why.

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.320 align:middle line:84%
In that case, it's
very simple, OK?

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.570 align:middle line:84%
But in other
representation, gamma 5

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:14.680 align:middle line:90%
can be more complicated.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:23.120 align:middle line:90%


00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:23.620 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:24.537 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:25:24.537 --> 00:25:31.760 align:middle line:90%


00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you have a question?

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:38.267 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Another way
to do that, as you said,

00:25:38.267 --> 00:25:41.910 align:middle line:84%
would be to try to find the
unitary matrix that shows--

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:43.620 align:middle line:84%
under which this
arbitrary representation

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.880 align:middle line:84%
is equivalent to the
chiral representation.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.420 align:middle line:84%
From this argument,
can we figure out what

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.945 align:middle line:84%
that unitary
[INAUDIBLE] looks like?

00:25:50.945 --> 00:25:51.820 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:52.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you can.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:53.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.330 align:middle line:84%
No it's not a unitary
transformation, just

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.760 align:middle line:90%
a similar transformation, yeah.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.370 align:middle line:84%
So each of them are related
by a similar transformation.

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:04.000 align:middle line:90%
And, indeed, the gamma 5--

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.890 align:middle line:84%
gamma 5 in the
other representation

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.473 align:middle line:84%
are related to this one just by
a similar transformation, too.

00:26:08.473 --> 00:26:11.650 align:middle line:90%


00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I will
use that language

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:15.930 align:middle line:84%
when I talk about
Majorana spinor.

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.800 align:middle line:84%
So, in this case, it's
sufficiently simple.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to
use that language.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but you can
use that language.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.970 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's go back to
this chiral representation

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and write the
Dirac equation into

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.027 align:middle line:90%
this chiral representation.

00:26:32.027 --> 00:26:36.950 align:middle line:90%


00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:38.705 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, one second.

00:26:38.705 --> 00:26:43.080 align:middle line:90%


00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.820 align:middle line:84%
So, now, if you write
the Dirac equation

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:48.820 align:middle line:90%
in terms of psi L and psi R--

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.850 align:middle line:84%
so, remember, the Dirac
equation have the following form

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:53.950 align:middle line:90%
of Dirac Lagrangian density.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:59.830 align:middle line:90%


00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:02.310 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And then since psi is just
equal to the sum of the--

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:14.820 align:middle line:90%
so psi-- psi R, OK?

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And then you can just write
this in terms of psi L

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:21.450 align:middle line:84%
and psi R. Write this in
terms psi L and psi R.

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And then you find that
the cross term vanish.

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:26.070 align:middle line:84%
You can also check
this explicitly

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:29.130 align:middle line:84%
in the chiral representation,
but the expression

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:31.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm writing down is general, OK?

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:35.710 align:middle line:84%
So you can write
it as psi dagger

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:48.945 align:middle line:84%
partial sub 0, plus i sigma i,
partial i, psi L. Yeah, sorry.

00:27:48.945 --> 00:27:53.470 align:middle line:90%


00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:59.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, actually, psi R dagger.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.978 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let me first write.

00:28:00.978 --> 00:28:02.270 align:middle line:90%
I think I said something wrong.

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:02.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, OK.

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:40.850 align:middle line:90%


00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:41.350 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:44.620 align:middle line:90%


00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:47.410 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, as I said,
so this expression

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:49.750 align:middle line:84%
only applies to the
chiral representation, OK?

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So in the chiral
representation of gamma star--

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:01.630 align:middle line:84%
in this space of star, and
then we have two components.

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Then I can write this psi
and the psi L and psi R

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:05.890 align:middle line:90%
into two components.

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:07.720 align:middle line:90%
And then, yeah.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.390 align:middle line:84%
So this is just ordinary
sigma matrices, OK?

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:14.470 align:middle line:90%


00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
expression you get, OK?

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:20.170 align:middle line:90%


00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:21.265 align:middle line:90%
So what you notice--

00:29:21.265 --> 00:29:26.110 align:middle line:90%


00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:27.550 align:middle line:90%
is that for m equal to 0--

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:30.760 align:middle line:90%


00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:44.620 align:middle line:84%
so there's no coupling
between psi L and psi R, OK?

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's the mass term which
coupled them together, OK?

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.860 align:middle line:90%
Kinetic term-- psi L--

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:56.380 align:middle line:84%
there's no cross term between
the psi L and psi R, OK?

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And this behavior
is actually general.

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.277 align:middle line:84%
You can write it in
arbitrary representations.

00:30:00.277 --> 00:30:02.110 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, in
arbitrary representation,

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:04.510 align:middle line:84%
I can no longer use
this sigma i, OK?

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:10.630 align:middle line:90%
And so in this particular form--

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:12.610 align:middle line:84%
even though this
feature is general,

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:15.340 align:middle line:84%
but this particular
form of the kinetic term

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:18.630 align:middle line:84%
only applies for the
chiral representation.

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:19.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:22.460 align:middle line:90%


00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:26.660 align:middle line:84%
So for m equal to 0, you don't
have coupling between the psi L

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and psi R. And then you only
have to say, oh, diagonal

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.560 align:middle line:90%
term and psi R term.

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And then that gives
you something else, OK?

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.200 align:middle line:84%
So, again, this is reduced
to our previous statement

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.420 align:middle line:84%
that if you have
a massless case,

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.000 align:middle line:84%
you can describe using a
two-component spinor, OK?

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.160 align:middle line:90%
So here, indeed.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:51.290 align:middle line:84%
But, here, there's
also something extra.

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:52.420 align:middle line:90%
So what do you see--

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:53.590 align:middle line:90%
something extra here?

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:59.970 align:middle line:90%


00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:01.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.210 align:middle line:90%
Did somebody raise your-- yes.

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:05.080 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.104 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:31:06.104 --> 00:31:10.944 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Why are we now taking
the psi equals psi L plus psi

00:31:10.944 --> 00:31:15.532 align:middle line:84%
R instead of before we
had it as psi L and Psi R

00:31:15.532 --> 00:31:16.490 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Right, right.

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:17.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.850 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:19.998 align:middle line:90%
A good question.

00:31:19.998 --> 00:31:21.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, this expression is wrong.

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:23.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.810 align:middle line:90%
Somehow, I was doing a--

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:27.330 align:middle line:90%
I was trying to-- yeah.

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:30.210 align:middle line:90%


00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:32.490 align:middle line:84%
I remembered I wrote this
in the general basis,

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:34.650 align:middle line:84%
but then I realized I only
wrote it in that basis.

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, in the general
basis, I would

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.480 align:middle line:84%
have psi equal to psi
L plus psi R. Yeah.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.610 align:middle line:84%
But then I realized, I
only write the kinetic term

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:43.590 align:middle line:90%
in this specific basis.

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:46.410 align:middle line:90%


00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:46.910 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:47.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:50.792 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that expression does
not apply for the chiral basis

00:31:50.792 --> 00:31:51.875 align:middle line:90%
but apply for the general.

00:31:51.875 --> 00:31:56.710 align:middle line:90%


00:31:56.710 --> 00:32:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So here, actually,
something profound

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:06.430 align:middle line:84%
happens because, when m equal to
0, when you don't have coupling

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:09.490 align:middle line:84%
between psi L and
psi R, you actually

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:11.980 align:middle line:90%
get the extra symmetry, OK?

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:24.890 align:middle line:84%
So in the Dirac Lagrangian,
as we discussed earlier,

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:28.150 align:middle line:90%
so we have a U1 symmetry.

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Psi goes to exponential
i alpha psi, OK?

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:35.810 align:middle line:84%
So this Dirac Lagrangian
is invariant under that

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:37.070 align:middle line:90%
because the psi is complex.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:43.830 align:middle line:90%


00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:48.340 align:middle line:84%
But, now, psi L and psi
R-- they are separate.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:51.330 align:middle line:84%
So, now, I can actually
transform psi L and psi R

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:52.740 align:middle line:90%
separately, OK?

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:57.030 align:middle line:84%
So under this transformation,
psi L and psi R

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:59.760 align:middle line:90%
transform the same, OK?

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:05.410 align:middle line:90%
But, now, m equal to 0--

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:09.760 align:middle line:84%
I can have psi L goes to
exponential i alpha L,

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:22.710 align:middle line:84%
psi L. Psi R goes to exponential
i alpha R, psi R because they

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:26.640 align:middle line:90%
only couple to themselves, OK?

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And, now, I have
this symmetry, OK?

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And so, now-- so,
here, you have U1,

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:43.340 align:middle line:84%
and now you have U1 times U1
called U1 times L and U1R.

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:48.430 align:middle line:84%
So these are called
chiral symmetries

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:52.240 align:middle line:84%
because they transform the
left and the right separately.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.335 align:middle line:90%


00:33:55.335 --> 00:33:55.835 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:55.835 --> 00:34:01.090 align:middle line:90%


00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:01.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:03.560 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I'm a
little bit confused

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.430 align:middle line:84%
why you can't write psi as the
sum of the two projections?

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:07.120 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.643 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Why you
can't write psi

00:34:08.643 --> 00:34:10.060 align:middle line:84%
as the sum of the
two projections?

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:10.601 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: No.

00:34:10.601 --> 00:34:12.810 align:middle line:84%
No, I can write it-- no,
I can write it that way.

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Just, now, I'm using
the two-component form.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:19.739 align:middle line:84%
When I write two-component
form, then I write psi that way,

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:24.960 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't make sense because
psi L is the upper two

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.030 align:middle line:84%
component, and psi R is
the lower two component.

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm using the same
notation for this spaces.

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And so in these spaces,
psi L and psi R,

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:36.630 align:middle line:90%
they only have two components.

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:39.780 align:middle line:84%
But in the general case, there
have four components, OK?

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:42.429 align:middle line:84%
So in the general case, I
can write psi equal to psi L

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and psi R. But in
these spaces, I cannot.

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:47.651 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, using this
notation, I cannot.

00:34:47.651 --> 00:34:55.719 align:middle line:90%


00:34:55.719 --> 00:35:00.160 align:middle line:84%
So, now, you have a
new symmetry equal to--

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:09.410 align:middle line:84%
which you can transform
them separately, OK?

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And the symmetries are one
of the most important aspect

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:15.930 align:middle line:84%
of physics, and they have
very important implications,

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:16.920 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And the chiral symmetry actually
has also very important effect

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:26.780 align:middle line:90%
in particle physics--

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:30.020 align:middle line:90%
for example, the pions.

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:33.290 align:middle line:90%
The pions has to do with--

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:35.180 align:middle line:90%
I will not go into detail.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:39.890 align:middle line:84%
The pions-- they essentially
come from the chiral

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:41.360 align:middle line:90%
symmetries.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Without the chiral
symmetries, there's no pion.

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.070 align:middle line:90%
There's no pions, OK?

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And actually understanding
how the pions

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.920 align:middle line:84%
come from the chiral
symmetries, et cetera--

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:58.110 align:middle line:84%
there was a Nobel Prize to
Nambu a number of years ago,

00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:59.930 align:middle line:84%
which our colleague
Goldstone also

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:04.560 align:middle line:84%
made a very important
contribution to that.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And, also, nature--
also interesting

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:12.540 align:middle line:84%
about this chiral symmetry
is that they are there.

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Say, if you have a
classical massless-- say,

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:18.920 align:middle line:84%
if you have a
massless Lagrangian,

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.890 align:middle line:84%
then you can have the symmetry
in the classical level,

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:23.430 align:middle line:90%
in the Lagrangian level.

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:24.980 align:middle line:84%
But once you
quantize this theory,

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:28.140 align:middle line:90%
you find the symmetry goes away.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.130 align:middle line:90%
It becomes anomalous.

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:30.840 align:middle line:90%
It could become anomalous.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Symmetry is only present
in the classical level

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:36.777 align:middle line:90%
but not in the quantum level.

00:36:36.777 --> 00:36:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And, again, that plays
a very important role

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:40.130 align:middle line:90%
in particle physics, actually.

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:40.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the bottom line is
that the chiral symmetry

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.470 align:middle line:84%
is very important in
many aspects of physics.

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:52.200 align:middle line:84%
It's also important in many
condensed matter systems,

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.880 align:middle line:90%
like liquid helium, et cetera.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.275 align:middle line:84%
So you can also write this
symmetry for general gamma.

00:36:58.275 --> 00:37:04.470 align:middle line:90%


00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:08.530 align:middle line:84%
So for general gamma, you can
have your previous symmetry.

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:11.620 align:middle line:84%
So, now, I'm using the
four-component notation,

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:15.490 align:middle line:84%
which psi L and psi R
transform the same way.

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:17.205 align:middle line:84%
And then, now, you
have a new symmetry.

00:37:17.205 --> 00:37:22.280 align:middle line:90%


00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.760 align:middle line:90%
Gamma 5-- OK.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And now you can put the
gamma 5 in the exponents.

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:37.510 align:middle line:90%


00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:38.770 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:40.230 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:42.365 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:42.365 --> 00:37:43.240 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.655 align:middle line:84%
Alpha tilde is just
some other constant--

00:37:44.655 --> 00:37:45.360 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Oh, alpha tilde.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.810 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: If tilde is
just some other constant,

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:47.893 align:middle line:90%
then you multiply gamma 5.

00:37:47.893 --> 00:37:50.780 align:middle line:90%


00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So the way to understand
that these two are related--

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:58.850 align:middle line:84%
so think about the
transformation here.

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:02.330 align:middle line:84%
So, here, we can rewrite
a little bit differently.

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:06.370 align:middle line:84%
We can consider rewrite
this alpha L and alpha R

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:09.120 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the following.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's consider the two
transformation-- one

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:16.350 align:middle line:84%
transformation, psi L, and
psi R transform the same.

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And the other transformation is
that they transform oppositely.

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:23.460 align:middle line:84%
They transform in the
opposite phase, OK?

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:26.325 align:middle line:90%
So I write the alpha--

00:38:26.325 --> 00:38:28.350 align:middle line:84%
and this writing
is like that, OK?

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:33.110 align:middle line:84%
So, in this way, psi L and psi
R transform the same, but--

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:35.370 align:middle line:84%
psi L and psi R, they
transform opposite

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:39.080 align:middle line:84%
because they have opposite
eigenvalue on the gamma 5.

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
equivalent to that.

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:46.660 align:middle line:90%


00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:47.210 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:49.870 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:50.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:54.500 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Why is it called gamma
5 rather than, say, gamma 4?

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.870 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: I think, again,
it's a historical reason.

00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:59.870 align:middle line:90%


00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:06.280 align:middle line:84%
So people often like to
go to Euclidean space.

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.890 align:middle line:84%
So when you go to
Euclidean space,

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:11.610 align:middle line:90%
you continue gamma 0 to gamma 4.

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:14.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, just-- yeah, to gamma 4.

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you reserve
gamma 4 for that.

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Then the gamma 5 is
the next one you take.

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:22.133 align:middle line:90%


00:39:22.133 --> 00:39:22.800 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.820 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:27.030 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is there a
physical reason why

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:29.190 align:middle line:90%
the massless case is special?

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Is it because it
becomes scale-free,

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:32.370 align:middle line:90%
or something like that?

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:33.870 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:36.510 align:middle line:84%
So massless case--
it's always special.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And you will see, in
physics, actually,

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:43.260 align:middle line:84%
the massless case
actually gives you

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.990 align:middle line:84%
very much richer
structure, normally,

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:51.570 align:middle line:90%
than the massive particle.

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Mathematically, it's
because the massless case--

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:57.290 align:middle line:90%


00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:59.180 align:middle line:84%
in the massless case,
the representation

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:01.490 align:middle line:84%
of the Lorentz group
is very different

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:03.440 align:middle line:90%
from the massive case.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.390 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you
have a vector field,

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:08.330 align:middle line:84%
say, for Maxwell
field, for the photon,

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:10.910 align:middle line:84%
massless photon have
two polarizations.

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:13.040 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a
massive vector--

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.690 align:middle line:90%
say, for the photon is massive--

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:16.850 align:middle line:84%
then we'll have
three polarizations.

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And so the massless case
and the massive case

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.400 align:middle line:90%
are very, very different.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.830 align:middle line:90%
The fermion case is the same.

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:26.810 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
massive fermion,

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:28.432 align:middle line:84%
you have four
complex components.

00:40:28.432 --> 00:40:30.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a
massless case, then you

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.770 align:middle line:90%
have two complex components.

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:34.270 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: How about
very small mass?

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't that cause a problem
if you go from x [INAUDIBLE]??

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:40.242 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:40:40.242 --> 00:40:41.700 align:middle line:84%
That's a very
interesting question.

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.075 align:middle line:84%
And there are a
lot of subtleties

00:40:43.075 --> 00:40:47.190 align:middle line:84%
associated with that kind
of questions, indeed.

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:49.516 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is there
any sense in which

00:40:49.516 --> 00:40:53.530 align:middle line:84%
we can treat psi L and psi R
as different dynamical fields,

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:59.000 align:middle line:84%
like a complex scalar field
the case phi and phi star?

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.920 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Oh, psi L and psi
R certainly are independent--

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:07.980 align:middle line:84%
you can certainly treat them
as independent dynamical, yeah.

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:08.940 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:12.890 align:middle line:90%


00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:15.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So let's conclude our discussion
of the chiral spinors.

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And now we can talk about
the Majorana spinors.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:31.840 align:middle line:90%


00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:40.590 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the so the
Dirac spinor, which

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:44.320 align:middle line:84%
we have talked about so
far, is four components.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:48.810 align:middle line:84%
So you have four times
two real components, OK?

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And then the chiral
spinor we talked about--

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.190 align:middle line:90%


00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:57.800 align:middle line:84%
essentially, you have
two complex components.

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:02.150 align:middle line:84%
It's, say, 2 times 2
real components, OK?

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:03.990 align:middle line:90%
2 times 2 real components.

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:05.870 align:middle line:84%
So the next one I'm
going to talk about

00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:14.380 align:middle line:84%
is the Majorana, in which
case, I would argue,

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:17.770 align:middle line:84%
we have 4 times
1 real component.

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:21.920 align:middle line:84%
So it has four independent
real components, OK?

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:22.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:24.600 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Sorry going
back real quick.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.630 align:middle line:84%
So I'm assuming R and L are for
right-handed and left-handed

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:28.480 align:middle line:90%
in this [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:30.990 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:34.960 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So can you ever
have a spinor where--

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.780 align:middle line:84%
what does it mean to have
one of [INAUDIBLE] non-zero?

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:40.140 align:middle line:84%
So both of them are
non-zero, I guess.

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:41.910 align:middle line:84%
What is that--
because, in my mind,

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:43.690 align:middle line:84%
it is either right-handed
or right handed.

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:44.860 align:middle line:90%
What is the mixture of--

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.090 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: No, no, no, no.

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Physically, electron
contains both left and right.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so for massive
particle, because they always

00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:53.610 align:middle line:90%
couple together--

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:56.930 align:middle line:84%
so the left hand, so psi
L turning into psi R,

00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:59.370 align:middle line:84%
psi R turning to
psi L all the time.

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And for massive particle, you
cannot really separate them.

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:09.520 align:middle line:84%
But, now, for massless particle,
then psi L and psi R-- yeah,

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:12.710 align:middle line:84%
this is a very good question--
psi L and psi R are preserved.

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:16.030 align:middle line:84%
So massless particle is
either psi L or psi R.

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And then if you look at
their so-called helicity,

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:22.730 align:middle line:84%
it's either left-handed
or right-handed.

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:26.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's where the name
psi L and psi R come from.

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:29.180 align:middle line:84%
But, for the massive
particle, you cannot make this

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:30.310 align:middle line:90%
separation.

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:32.440 align:middle line:84%
But for the massless
case, then it's preserved.

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And then it's generally
left-handed or right-handed.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:38.580 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And, now, let's talk
about the last case--

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:43.265 align:middle line:90%
this case, which is--

00:43:43.265 --> 00:43:45.645 align:middle line:84%
you have four real
components, OK?

00:43:45.645 --> 00:43:49.990 align:middle line:90%


00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.920 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do?

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Again, we follow
the similar strategy

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:58.780 align:middle line:84%
to see whether it's possible
to have four real components.

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Again, we first-- the
idea is that you first

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:05.230 align:middle line:84%
try to find the special
representation of gamma

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:10.200 align:middle line:84%
matrices so that a spinor
that can be real, OK?

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And then you try to generalize
to any representation of gamma

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:14.470 align:middle line:90%
matrices.

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:18.100 align:middle line:90%


00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:26.050 align:middle line:84%
So, now, if you look
at the Dirac equation--

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:47.392 align:middle line:90%


00:44:47.392 --> 00:44:48.725 align:middle line:90%
now, look at the Dirac equation.

00:44:48.725 --> 00:44:58.310 align:middle line:90%


00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:05.360 align:middle line:84%
So if I want to find
the real spinor,

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.550 align:middle line:84%
then I ask myself
whether real spinor

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:10.700 align:middle line:84%
is compatible with
this equation, OK?

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:14.300 align:middle line:84%
So if the real scalar is not
compatible with this equation--

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.300 align:middle line:84%
because I take the
complex conjugate,

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:18.635 align:middle line:90%
I then take a gamma mu star.

00:45:18.635 --> 00:45:23.480 align:middle line:90%


00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:30.120 align:middle line:84%
If psi is real, then psi also
have to satisfy this equation,

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:30.630 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:34.400 align:middle line:84%
But, in general, gamma mu is
complex, as we wrote before--

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.450 align:middle line:90%
yeah, I just erased it.

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:39.270 align:middle line:84%
For example, in these
spaces, it's complex.

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:42.670 align:middle line:84%
With complex, then these two
equations are not compatible,

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:45.600 align:middle line:90%
and then psi cannot be real, OK?

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:46.290 align:middle line:90%
Simple as that.

00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:49.110 align:middle line:90%


00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:51.570 align:middle line:90%
But there's a way out.

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:53.790 align:middle line:84%
The way out is
that, if they exist,

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:58.690 align:middle line:84%
the representation of
gamma mu, the question

00:45:58.690 --> 00:46:06.720 align:middle line:84%
is whether there exists a
representation of gamma mu

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.995 align:middle line:90%
so that gamma mu is real.

00:46:07.995 --> 00:46:13.680 align:middle line:90%


00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:18.570 align:middle line:84%
So if this is real, and then
these two equations become

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:27.370 align:middle line:84%
the same, and then
for psi being real

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:30.980 align:middle line:84%
is compatible with the
Dirac equation, OK?

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:34.940 align:middle line:84%
It's compatible with
the Dirac equation.

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:41.240 align:middle line:84%
So, now, let's-- so then this
becomes a question of trial

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:42.710 align:middle line:90%
and error, OK?

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:44.990 align:middle line:84%
So you try to find the
representation of gamma

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:48.960 align:middle line:90%
matrices so that it's real OK.

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And then it turns
out, you can find it,

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:56.860 align:middle line:90%
and here is the answer.

00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:59.940 align:middle line:84%
So let me just write
down the answer.

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:04.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how he
originally found it--

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:07.895 align:middle line:84%
Majorana originally found
it, but here is the answer.

00:47:07.895 --> 00:47:32.290 align:middle line:90%


00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:35.600 align:middle line:90%
So this is four gamma matrices.

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
there, each of them

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:43.530 align:middle line:84%
is real because sigma 2 is pure
imaginary, and sigma 1, sigma 3

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:44.920 align:middle line:90%
are real.

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:46.630 align:middle line:90%
And so this is purely real.

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:47.400 align:middle line:90%
And you can check.

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:51.258 align:middle line:84%
This satisfied the algebra
of the government matrices.

00:47:51.258 --> 00:47:53.050 align:middle line:84%
They satisfy the algebra
of gamma matrices.

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:57.990 align:middle line:84%
They anticommute with each
other, and each of them

00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.740 align:middle line:90%
square--

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:00.653 align:middle line:90%
so each of them squaring 1.

00:48:00.653 --> 00:48:02.070 align:middle line:84%
So these three
square them into 1.

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:03.300 align:middle line:90%
This square equal minus 1.

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:12.480 align:middle line:90%


00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:15.210 align:middle line:84%
So, now, this is compatible
with Dirac equation,

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:18.370 align:middle line:90%
but this is actually not enough.

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:20.910 align:middle line:84%
We also have to be sure this
is compatible with the Lorentz

00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:24.430 align:middle line:90%
transformation, OK?

00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:26.930 align:middle line:84%
So, now, let's check whether
this is compatible with Lorentz

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:29.130 align:middle line:90%
transformation.

00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:32.750 align:middle line:90%
So, now, we have this sigma mu--

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:33.590 align:middle line:90%
gamma mu.

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And, remember,
the sigma mu, nu--

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.030 align:middle line:90%
I just erased it.

00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:43.290 align:middle line:90%


00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So now this is pure imaginary
because if gamma mu and gamma

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:50.030 align:middle line:84%
nu are real, their
commutator is also real.

00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And then sigma mu, nu
will be pure imaginary.

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:55.295 align:middle line:90%
And then that means S lambda--

00:48:55.295 --> 00:49:04.640 align:middle line:90%


00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.245 align:middle line:90%
so this is now purely real.

00:49:06.245 --> 00:49:10.260 align:middle line:90%


00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.610 align:middle line:90%
Now, this means this is real.

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:14.800 align:middle line:90%
And, now, we are done, OK?

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:19.180 align:middle line:84%
That means that if we
take the psi is real, then

00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:24.010 align:middle line:84%
after Lorentz transformation,
this remains to be real, OK?

00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And so that means that it's
compatible with Lorentz

00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:29.260 align:middle line:90%
transformation.

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:32.250 align:middle line:84%
So if we were not compatible
with Lorentz transmission,

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:35.010 align:middle line:90%
then we were finished, OK?

00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:36.720 align:middle line:84%
So this shows that
this remains real.

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:52.738 align:middle line:90%


00:49:52.738 --> 00:49:56.350 align:middle line:84%
So such a spinor is called
a Majorana spinor, OK?

00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:59.140 align:middle line:90%
So it has four real components.

00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we wrote there-- it
has four real components.

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:06.940 align:middle line:90%


00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:11.230 align:middle line:84%
So you can quantize
it, which, I think

00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:14.140 align:middle line:84%
I will give it as an
exercise for you to do, OK?

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:15.430 align:middle line:90%
You can quantize it.

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And then, in this
case, then the fermions

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:31.000 align:middle line:84%
are its own antiparticle, rather
than for the Dirac spinor.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.950 align:middle line:84%
You have particle
and antiparticle,

00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:39.374 align:middle line:84%
so this is the analog of the
real scalar in the spinor case.

00:50:39.374 --> 00:50:42.100 align:middle line:90%


00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:48.490 align:middle line:84%
So this was discovered
by Majorana in 1937, OK?

00:50:48.490 --> 00:50:49.660 align:middle line:90%
And he was very young.

00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:52.240 align:middle line:90%
At the time, he was 31.

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, a brilliant
physicist, complete genius.

00:50:57.670 --> 00:51:01.070 align:middle line:90%
And then, in 1938--

00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:03.860 align:middle line:90%
so he lived in Sicily, OK?

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.600 align:middle line:90%
So his hometown was in Sicily.

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:13.220 align:middle line:84%
So he boarded a ship
from Naples to Sicily.

00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And then he just disappeared
on the ship, never seen again.

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:20.110 align:middle line:90%


00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:25.760 align:middle line:84%
At the age of 32,
he just disappeared.

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:29.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's a quite--

00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:32.690 align:middle line:90%


00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:34.790 align:middle line:84%
yeah, extremely
brilliant physicist.

00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:35.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And there are all
kinds of stories

00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:41.630 align:middle line:84%
about his disappearance--
that he may be killed by Mafia

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:44.360 align:middle line:90%
or maybe suicide, et cetera.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:46.600 align:middle line:90%
But just nobody knows.

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:47.925 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:51:47.925 --> 00:51:50.300 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: You said that all
the choices of gamma matrices

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:51.260 align:middle line:90%
were equivalent.

00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:52.190 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:54.410 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: This doesn't
really feel equivalent.

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:56.650 align:middle line:84%
It is still equivalent to
the other representations?

00:51:56.650 --> 00:51:57.250 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:51:57.250 --> 00:51:58.270 align:middle line:90%
We will talk about that.

00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:02.070 align:middle line:90%


00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So now we have chosen a
very specific representation

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:14.450 align:middle line:84%
for gamma matrices, which psi
can be chosen to be real, OK?

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:21.170 align:middle line:84%
But how about for the
general representation?

00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:23.225 align:middle line:84%
So now we talk
about the general.

00:52:23.225 --> 00:52:29.240 align:middle line:90%


00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:34.360 align:middle line:90%
Majorana spinor-- yeah.

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, also, let me
just make a remark.

00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Majorana spinor, of course,
also plays a very important role

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:41.550 align:middle line:90%
in modern-day physics.

00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:45.720 align:middle line:90%


00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Say, for example, people suspect
a neutrino could be a Majorana

00:52:51.810 --> 00:52:53.310 align:middle line:90%
spinner, OK?

00:52:53.310 --> 00:52:57.330 align:middle line:84%
So to check whether a neutrino
is a Majorana spinor--

00:52:57.330 --> 00:53:00.600 align:middle line:90%


00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:03.990 align:middle line:84%
yeah, it's a forefront
experimental program--

00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:06.600 align:middle line:90%
has been pursued by many years.

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And, also, in condensed
matter, in quantum information,

00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:16.090 align:middle line:84%
and Majorana spinor play
a very important role.

00:53:16.090 --> 00:53:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And so, in condensed matter,
you only have electron.

00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So electron and the Majorana
spinor is, like, half electron,

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:23.940 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Because the electron have
eight components, right?

00:53:26.810 --> 00:53:27.390 align:middle line:90%
Remember.

00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And Majorana only
have four components.

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:32.190 align:middle line:84%
So Majorana is,
like, half electron.

00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:36.280 align:middle line:84%
So precisely because it's
heuristically half electron,

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:40.210 align:middle line:84%
it has very stable
topological properties,

00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:43.150 align:middle line:84%
which a single
electron does not have.

00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And whether you can engineer in
your condensed matter systems,

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Majorana spinor then
became a Holy Grail.

00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can do it,
and then you can do lots of--

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:58.840 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you can achieve more
stable quantum computation,

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.760 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:01.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:04.090 align:middle line:84%
During the last
number of years, there

00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:06.580 align:middle line:84%
have been various
experimental reports.

00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:10.480 align:middle line:84%
People say they have
engineered Majorana spinor

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:14.920 align:middle line:84%
in the lab, which I think has
never been fully confirmed,

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:15.880 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:18.130 align:middle line:84%
None of them has
been fully confirmed.

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so, yeah, so, now,
let's talk about Majorana spinor

00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:33.415 align:middle line:84%
in general basis,
for general gamma mu.

00:54:33.415 --> 00:54:36.370 align:middle line:90%


00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So the idea would be similar to
the case of the chiral spinor.

00:54:43.570 --> 00:54:46.180 align:middle line:90%
For the chiral spinor--

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:48.220 align:middle line:84%
in the chiral basis,
it's very simple, just

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:51.780 align:middle line:90%
upper and lower components.

00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:54.020 align:middle line:84%
So, for the chiral
spinor, you have

00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:55.430 align:middle line:84%
to introduce some
other structure

00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:59.780 align:middle line:84%
to isolate psi L and
psi R. So you have to--

00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:02.000 align:middle line:84%
now, you have this
nontrivial condition, OK?

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.177 align:middle line:84%
And the chiral fermions come
from this nontrivial condition.

00:55:05.177 --> 00:55:09.280 align:middle line:90%


00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:10.900 align:middle line:84%
So, now, the key
is that, how do you

00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:16.070 align:middle line:84%
find the analogous condition
to the psi to be real

00:55:16.070 --> 00:55:18.560 align:middle line:90%
in the general basis, OK?

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Because when gamma mu is
generally complex, clearly,

00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:25.730 align:middle line:84%
you cannot set the psi
equal to psi star, OK?

00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:27.290 align:middle line:90%
That does not make sense.

00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:30.530 align:middle line:84%
You have to find another
equivalent equation

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:32.420 align:middle line:84%
to do, essentially,
the same thing, OK?

00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:35.180 align:middle line:90%
So that's the basic idea.

00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:41.430 align:middle line:84%
OK, so for this
purpose, we want to--

00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:43.950 align:middle line:84%
now, we use any
gamma matrices that

00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:47.090 align:middle line:84%
are equivalent to each other
up to a similar transformation,

00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:48.820 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:59.840 align:middle line:84%
So let's denote-- this
basis by gamma m, OK?

00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we have gamma m, which
is this called Majorana basis.

00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And then any choice of gamma
mu then related to gamma m

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:11.690 align:middle line:84%
by a similar
transformation-- that

00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:22.460 align:middle line:84%
means there exists some matrix
C that the C can take any gamma

00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:26.390 align:middle line:90%
mu into gamma mu m, OK?

00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So there must exist C, and
this equation is satisfied.

00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:37.265 align:middle line:90%


00:56:37.265 --> 00:56:37.765 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:56:37.765 --> 00:56:45.010 align:middle line:90%


00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:47.530 align:middle line:84%
So, now, given this
C, then we can easily

00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:59.260 align:middle line:84%
write down the condition
for the general basis

00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:09.190 align:middle line:84%
because under such
a change of basis,

00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:11.720 align:middle line:84%
the spinor in the Majorana
basis, which is real,

00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:14.900 align:middle line:84%
is related to the spinor
in the gamma mu basis

00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:18.840 align:middle line:90%
by this transformation C, OK?

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:21.270 align:middle line:84%
So the C relates to
the gamma matrices.

00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:23.400 align:middle line:84%
But the C, of course, also
relates to the spinor.

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:25.110 align:middle line:90%
It's just a change of basis, OK?

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And so psi M will be
related to psi by C.

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And now, since the psi M
is equal to psi M star,

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:43.920 align:middle line:84%
so that means that C star psi
star should be equal to C psi,

00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:44.420 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:50.990 align:middle line:84%
So that means the psi star
should be equal to B psi

00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:59.390 align:middle line:84%
with B equal to C
minus 1 star C, OK?

00:57:59.390 --> 00:58:01.340 align:middle line:84%
So that should be the
condition which you

00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:02.705 align:middle line:90%
impose in the general basis.

00:58:02.705 --> 00:58:13.282 align:middle line:90%


00:58:13.282 --> 00:58:14.740 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that should
be the condition

00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:17.240 align:middle line:84%
you should impose in
the general basis.

00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:20.350 align:middle line:84%
So you have to introduce
this C. So if you find that

00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:28.410 align:middle line:84%
the transformation between the
general gamma mu and the gamma

00:58:28.410 --> 00:58:32.000 align:middle line:84%
mu m, and then you can
use that to find the B.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And once you find the B, and
then you can find the-- you can

00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:36.540 align:middle line:90%
impose the--

00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:38.760 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so this is called
a Majorana condition

00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:39.840 align:middle line:90%
in the general basis.

00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:53.170 align:middle line:90%


00:58:53.170 --> 00:58:56.770 align:middle line:84%
So let's understand
a little bit.

00:58:56.770 --> 00:59:00.435 align:middle line:84%
So, actually, we can understand
the B more directly, OK?

00:59:00.435 --> 00:59:02.310 align:middle line:84%
So, here, we expanded
from C. But we actually

00:59:02.310 --> 00:59:05.220 align:middle line:90%
can find the B more directly.

00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:13.920 align:middle line:84%
We can just take the complex
conjugate of this equation

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:16.830 align:middle line:90%
because gamma mu m is real.

00:59:16.830 --> 00:59:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So we can also take the complex
conjugate of this equation.

00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:28.997 align:middle line:84%
So that means that, since gamma
mu m equal to gamma mu m star,

00:59:28.997 --> 00:59:31.080 align:middle line:84%
but if we take complex
conjugate of that equation,

00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:35.370 align:middle line:84%
means that the C star
gamma mu, C minus 1 star

00:59:35.370 --> 00:59:40.770 align:middle line:84%
is equal to C gamma
mu, C minus 1.

00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:42.960 align:middle line:90%
And now, again, you just--

00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:43.815 align:middle line:90%
sorry.

00:59:43.815 --> 00:59:46.020 align:middle line:90%
This would be star, OK?

00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:48.750 align:middle line:84%
So, now, if we put all
the C to this side,

00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:56.280 align:middle line:84%
and then we find
gamma mu star is

00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:01.050 align:middle line:84%
just equal to B gamma
mu, B minus 1, OK?

01:00:01.050 --> 01:00:03.180 align:middle line:84%
So you just put
this to this side.

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Then you just--
so this becomes B,

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and then this becomes
B minus 1, OK?

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:13.950 align:middle line:90%
So, now, we see that B--

01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:15.740 align:middle line:90%
this actually makes sense.

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:20.530 align:middle line:84%
This is actually the matrix we
take gamma mu to gamma mu star,

01:00:20.530 --> 01:00:22.430 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:25.735 align:middle line:84%
So B is the matrix
to take star, OK?

01:00:25.735 --> 01:00:31.830 align:middle line:90%


01:00:31.830 --> 01:00:32.330 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:33.970 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

01:00:33.970 --> 01:00:35.432 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:00:35.432 --> 01:00:38.610 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
this is [INAUDIBLE]..

01:00:38.610 --> 01:00:39.870 align:middle line:90%
What group to they belong to?

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:44.400 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Well, they're just
general, nonsingular matrices.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:49.295 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just 4-by-4
nonsingular matrices.

01:00:49.295 --> 01:00:53.480 align:middle line:90%


01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:57.225 align:middle line:84%
They often can be
chosen to be unitary.

01:00:57.225 --> 01:00:58.600 align:middle line:84%
But, in principle,
you don't have

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:00.324 align:middle line:90%
to choose them to be unitary.

01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:05.100 align:middle line:90%


01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:08.790 align:middle line:90%
OK, so, now, let's double check.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:12.450 align:middle line:84%
So let's call this
equation star star.

01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:17.550 align:middle line:90%
So let's check that star star--

01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:21.030 align:middle line:84%
so we show that, here,
in this representation,

01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:23.520 align:middle line:84%
this is compatible with
Lorentz transformation, OK?

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So we still need
to check star, star

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:36.150 align:middle line:84%
is compatible with
Lorentz transformation.

01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:41.340 align:middle line:90%


01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So what do we mean by this
is compatible with Lorentz

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.740 align:middle line:90%
transformation?

01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:51.220 align:middle line:84%
We mean that, if
we take a psi which

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:52.630 align:middle line:90%
satisfies this condition--

01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:58.860 align:middle line:90%


01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:04.070 align:middle line:84%
take a psi which
satisfies star star,

01:02:04.070 --> 01:02:06.560 align:middle line:84%
and then we make a
Lorentz transformation psi

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:15.860 align:middle line:84%
prime equal to S lambda psi,
and then psi prime should also

01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:17.614 align:middle line:90%
satisfy that condition--

01:02:17.614 --> 01:02:21.570 align:middle line:90%


01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:22.440 align:middle line:90%
star star, OK?

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:24.982 align:middle line:84%
So that means this is compatible
with Lorentz transformation.

01:02:24.982 --> 01:02:29.070 align:middle line:84%
It means that the
psi prime star should

01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:34.740 align:middle line:84%
be equal to the same
as B psi prime, OK?

01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:42.080 align:middle line:84%
So it means that psi prime star
should satisfy that equation.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.910 align:middle line:90%
So, now, let's check that.

01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:44.870 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's check this.

01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:49.110 align:middle line:90%


01:02:49.110 --> 01:02:53.283 align:middle line:84%
So from here-- so
before checking that,

01:02:53.283 --> 01:02:54.700 align:middle line:84%
do you have any
questions on this?

01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:58.750 align:middle line:90%


01:02:58.750 --> 01:02:59.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:02:59.250 --> 01:03:30.450 align:middle line:90%


01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:33.080 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.850 align:middle line:84%
So, first, from this
equation-- let's

01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:36.095 align:middle line:90%
call this star, star, star.

01:03:36.095 --> 01:03:39.740 align:middle line:90%


01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:42.830 align:middle line:84%
From this star cube
equation, so we

01:03:42.830 --> 01:03:56.780 align:middle line:84%
can find the B when you
act on sigma mu B minus 1.

01:03:56.780 --> 01:04:01.790 align:middle line:84%
So that gives you minus
sigma mu, nu, star, OK?

01:04:01.790 --> 01:04:08.030 align:middle line:84%
So this is obvious because
sigma mu, nu has i there.

01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:10.010 align:middle line:84%
So the minus sign
comes from the i.

01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And, otherwise, the B takes each
gamma matrices there into star,

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:18.080 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And then that means
that the S star, lambda,

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:30.635 align:middle line:84%
which is given by exponential
1/2 omega mu, nu, sigma star--

01:04:30.635 --> 01:04:33.930 align:middle line:90%


01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:38.675 align:middle line:84%
sigma mu, nu star,
now this is equal to--

01:04:38.675 --> 01:04:45.310 align:middle line:90%


01:04:45.310 --> 01:04:47.815 align:middle line:90%
yeah, you can just plug this in.

01:04:47.815 --> 01:04:50.910 align:middle line:90%


01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:53.620 align:middle line:84%
It just becomes
exponential minus i

01:04:53.620 --> 01:05:06.480 align:middle line:84%
omega mu, nu, B
sigma B minus 1, OK?

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:07.850 align:middle line:90%
So let me just--

01:05:07.850 --> 01:05:11.850 align:middle line:84%
yeah-- B sigma mu,
nu, B minus 1, OK?

01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:14.640 align:middle line:84%
So I just inserted the
sigma mu, nu, star.

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.440 align:middle line:84%
It's equal to minus
that here, OK?

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:19.740 align:middle line:90%


01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:23.670 align:middle line:84%
So, now, you can see that this
B minus 1 is in the exponential.

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:25.980 align:middle line:84%
You can immediately
take it down.

01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:33.295 align:middle line:84%
So that is just equal to
B S lambda B minus 1, OK?

01:05:33.295 --> 01:05:36.970 align:middle line:90%


01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:39.750 align:middle line:84%
So because when you expand
this in power series, B and B

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:43.710 align:middle line:84%
minus 1 always cancel, except
the first one and the last one.

01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:46.830 align:middle line:84%
So we have used this
trick many times.

01:05:46.830 --> 01:05:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and then so we get
a very nice relation that,

01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:56.220 align:middle line:84%
under Lorentz transformation--
so the Lorentz transformation

01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:58.230 align:middle line:84%
matrix on the
complex conjugation,

01:05:58.230 --> 01:06:03.660 align:middle line:84%
again, is generated by this
B, related by this B matrix.

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:05.415 align:middle line:84%
And, now, it's
just immediate, OK?

01:06:05.415 --> 01:06:09.360 align:middle line:90%


01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And now just immediate, so when
you have the psi prime equal

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:20.560 align:middle line:84%
to that, let's just take the
star of this equation, OK?

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:36.770 align:middle line:84%
So psi prime star just equal
to S star, lambda psi star, OK?

01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So that is equal to B S
lambda B minus 1 and B S--

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:48.590 align:middle line:90%
B psi, OK?

01:06:48.590 --> 01:06:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So this is equal to
B S lambda psi, OK?

01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So this is equal
to B psi prime--

01:06:58.190 --> 01:06:59.780 align:middle line:84%
precisely what we
were trying to show.

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:09.420 align:middle line:90%


01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:09.920 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:10.930 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

01:07:10.930 --> 01:07:17.110 align:middle line:90%


01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:19.710 align:middle line:84%
OK, so, now, let me give
you an explicit example

01:07:19.710 --> 01:07:28.320 align:middle line:90%
of this matrix B in the--

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.480 align:middle line:84%
so for this Majorana
representation,

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:32.760 align:middle line:84%
the B is just equal
to identity, OK?

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:37.170 align:middle line:84%
So B is just equal to identity
in this representation.

01:07:37.170 --> 01:07:39.772 align:middle line:84%
And, now, let's try to give
you an example of the B

01:07:39.772 --> 01:07:42.330 align:middle line:90%
in the other representation.

01:07:42.330 --> 01:07:46.240 align:middle line:84%
So suppose, in the
chiral representation,

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:50.160 align:middle line:90%
which I wrote down before--

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:54.630 align:middle line:84%
so, yeah, I should
not have erased it.

01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:56.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, anyway.

01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So in the chiral representation
I wrote down before,

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.350 align:middle line:84%
so if you stare at
that expression,

01:08:01.350 --> 01:08:07.185 align:middle line:84%
you find that gamma 0,
gamma 1, and gamma 2--

01:08:07.185 --> 01:08:12.330 align:middle line:84%
or gamma 0, gamma 1, and gamma
3 are imaginary, pure imaginary.

01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:17.880 align:middle line:90%


01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:20.040 align:middle line:90%
And the gamma 2 is real.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:22.800 align:middle line:90%


01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:27.720 align:middle line:90%
Gamma 2 is real, OK?

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:32.370 align:middle line:84%
So this pure imaginary means,
when you take the star of them,

01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:34.210 align:middle line:90%
you get the minus sign.

01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:35.850 align:middle line:84%
So this one, you take
the star of them,

01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:40.160 align:middle line:90%
you just get back to itself.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:48.790 align:middle line:84%
So, now, if we look
at this equation,

01:08:48.790 --> 01:08:52.840 align:middle line:84%
so if this is pure
imaginary, you get the star.

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:55.290 align:middle line:90%
You get the minus itself.

01:08:55.290 --> 01:08:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And then, essentially,
you get the minus self

01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:02.680 align:middle line:84%
means the B actually
anticommutes with gamma mu, OK?

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Because you can just bring
B minus 1 to this side,

01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:10.600 align:middle line:84%
so it just becomes gamma mu
star B equal to B gamma mu.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So if this is minus
gamma mu, that

01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:16.270 align:middle line:84%
means B should anticommute
with gamma mu, OK?

01:09:16.270 --> 01:09:22.109 align:middle line:84%
But if gamma is real, that means
B will commute with mu, OK?

01:09:22.109 --> 01:09:25.560 align:middle line:84%
If mu is real, then that means
B should commute with mu.

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:30.990 align:middle line:84%
So, now, in this chiral basis,
these three are pure imaginary.

01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:34.580 align:middle line:84%
That means B needs to
anticommute with them.

01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:35.399 align:middle line:90%
But this is real.

01:09:35.399 --> 01:09:37.770 align:middle line:84%
It means B needs to
commute with this guy.

01:09:37.770 --> 01:09:39.410 align:middle line:90%
Then what is B?

01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:40.400 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Gamma 2.

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.346 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Hmm?

01:09:41.346 --> 01:09:42.240 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Gamma 2.

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:43.050 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Exactly.

01:09:43.050 --> 01:09:47.005 align:middle line:84%
So B, in this case, can
only be gamma 2, OK?

01:09:47.005 --> 01:09:50.380 align:middle line:90%


01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And then we can work
out, what is the Majorana

01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:54.384 align:middle line:90%
condition in this basis--

01:09:54.384 --> 01:09:59.600 align:middle line:90%


01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.280 align:middle line:90%
so, essentially, this condition.

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:04.710 align:middle line:90%


01:10:04.710 --> 01:10:15.890 align:middle line:84%
So that means that the psi star
should be equal to gamma 2 psi,

01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:16.910 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's the Majorana
condition here.

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:22.400 align:middle line:84%
So, now, remember,
in the chiral basis,

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:26.870 align:middle line:84%
we can write psi in terms
of the psi L and psi R.

01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:28.910 align:middle line:84%
So, essentially, we
have this condition.

01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:35.860 align:middle line:90%


01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:38.210 align:middle line:90%
So I erased my gamma 2.

01:10:38.210 --> 01:10:40.160 align:middle line:90%
So I saw the gamma 2--

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.290 align:middle line:90%
let me write it here explicitly.

01:10:42.290 --> 01:10:54.670 align:middle line:84%
It's minus i gamma 2, 0 minus i
sigma 2 and sigma 2, here, OK?

01:10:54.670 --> 01:10:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So, now, if you look
at this condition,

01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:00.460 align:middle line:84%
this means that no longer
psi L and psi R are no longer

01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:02.060 align:middle line:90%
independent of each other.

01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:08.680 align:middle line:84%
So psi L star should be equal
to minus i sigma 2 psi R

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:14.280 align:middle line:84%
or, equivalently, psi R
equal to i sigma 2 psi L--

01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:17.340 align:middle line:90%


01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:20.550 align:middle line:90%
or L star, OK?

01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:25.340 align:middle line:84%
So, in this case, the psi,
then, have the following form--

01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:30.450 align:middle line:84%
psi L i sigma 2
psi L. So sigma R

01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:35.010 align:middle line:84%
just can be expressed
in terms of sigma L.

01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:41.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is the Majorana spinor
in the chiral basis, OK?

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:44.550 align:middle line:84%
You see, there are only four
independent, real components

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:48.270 align:middle line:84%
because each psi L is two
complex components, OK?

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:51.950 align:middle line:90%


01:11:51.950 --> 01:11:52.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:54.038 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So why
do you [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:54.038 --> 01:11:58.023 align:middle line:84%
that psi and psi star are
not independent [INAUDIBLE]??

01:11:58.023 --> 01:11:58.606 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Hmm?

01:11:58.606 --> 01:11:59.380 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Why are they--

01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:00.255 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: No, no, no.

01:12:00.255 --> 01:12:03.360 align:middle line:84%
No, here, we are imposing
this condition, right?

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.610 align:middle line:90%
We are imposing this condition.

01:12:05.610 --> 01:12:06.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:07.568 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this is
Majorana condition we

01:12:07.568 --> 01:12:09.040 align:middle line:90%
want to impose in this basis.

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:12.005 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: And this is now
independent of massless

01:12:12.005 --> 01:12:12.880 align:middle line:90%
or massive particles?

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.030 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:15.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, this is-- yeah.

01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:18.730 align:middle line:90%


01:12:18.730 --> 01:12:20.140 align:middle line:90%
Good?

01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:24.100 align:middle line:84%
So this concludes our discussion
of the Majorana spinor.

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
questions on this?

01:12:26.670 --> 01:12:27.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:33.200 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So is the
orthogonal component of psi--

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:36.240 align:middle line:84%
the Majorana
fermion [INAUDIBLE]??

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:37.020 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry?

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:38.437 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: The
orthogonal component

01:12:38.437 --> 01:12:41.800 align:middle line:90%
of this Majorana species--

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:44.740 align:middle line:84%
like, possible--
in the chiral one,

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:47.060 align:middle line:84%
like, psi L, and
then you [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:50.265 align:middle line:84%
and then psi R. [INAUDIBLE]
two components of psi.

01:12:50.265 --> 01:12:50.890 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:12:50.890 --> 01:12:52.180 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: So we are--

01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:54.910 align:middle line:84%
we have one component
of psi, and there

01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:57.080 align:middle line:90%
should be another one, right?

01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:57.705 align:middle line:90%
So is that one?

01:12:57.705 --> 01:12:58.372 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry.

01:12:58.372 --> 01:13:00.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't quite understand
your question.

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:01.607 align:middle line:90%
Say it again-- what?

01:13:01.607 --> 01:13:02.690 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK, [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:02.690 --> 01:13:03.950 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: OK, OK.

01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:04.670 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:13:04.670 --> 01:13:05.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:07.580 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So, I guess, related
to an earlier question,

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:09.470 align:middle line:84%
how do we consider
handedness here

01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:13.792 align:middle line:84%
for a massless particle that's
also the Majorana, which psi L

01:13:13.792 --> 01:13:17.070 align:middle line:90%
and psi R are [INAUDIBLE]?

01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:18.150 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Right.

01:13:18.150 --> 01:13:24.982 align:middle line:90%
So for the-- yeah, if we--

01:13:24.982 --> 01:13:26.440 align:middle line:84%
for massless
particle, you can just

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:30.850 align:middle line:84%
direct it because then you don't
have to think about the psi R,

01:13:30.850 --> 01:13:34.510 align:middle line:84%
and this, you just have the
same number degrees of freedom

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:35.620 align:middle line:90%
as a massless particle.

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:40.330 align:middle line:90%


01:13:40.330 --> 01:13:42.160 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:42.660 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:45.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:46.320 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:49.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's now go
to the next topic.

01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:52.160 align:middle line:84%
We only have a few minutes,
so we can only just

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:53.285 align:middle line:90%
make some general comments.

01:13:53.285 --> 01:14:01.260 align:middle line:90%


01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:03.450 align:middle line:84%
So so far, mostly,
we have been talking

01:14:03.450 --> 01:14:05.430 align:middle line:90%
about continuous symmetries.

01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:09.060 align:middle line:90%


01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:14.635 align:middle line:84%
But there are also
discrete symmetries, OK?

01:14:14.635 --> 01:14:17.960 align:middle line:90%


01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:25.930 align:middle line:84%
So, by definition,
discrete symmetries

01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:33.505 align:middle line:84%
are symmetries, which don't
have continuous parameters, OK?

01:14:33.505 --> 01:14:37.780 align:middle line:90%


01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So continuous symmetries
are symmetries, which--

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:43.450 align:middle line:90%


01:14:43.450 --> 01:14:46.390 align:middle line:84%
yeah, which the
transformation dependence

01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:48.520 align:middle line:90%
on continuous parameter.

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Discrete symmetries,
you just don't, OK?

01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:53.740 align:middle line:84%
You don't have
continuous parameter.

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:58.690 align:middle line:84%
So simple example-- say,
let's imagine we have--

01:14:58.690 --> 01:15:01.555 align:middle line:84%
so this real scalar theory--
we can see that before.

01:15:01.555 --> 01:15:11.410 align:middle line:90%


01:15:11.410 --> 01:15:15.150 align:middle line:84%
So this theory has a discrete
symmetry because this

01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:16.950 align:middle line:90%
is invariant under phi.

01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:20.940 align:middle line:90%
It goes to minus phi, OK?

01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So because you see all
the terms are even,

01:15:23.790 --> 01:15:27.150 align:middle line:84%
so it's invariant under
phi go to minus phi.

01:15:27.150 --> 01:15:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And this transformation is
no continuous parameter, OK?

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:33.190 align:middle line:90%
So this is a discrete symmetry.

01:15:33.190 --> 01:15:35.940 align:middle line:90%
And so this is--

01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:37.873 align:middle line:84%
if you do it twice,
you go back to itself.

01:15:37.873 --> 01:15:39.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is often
called the Z2 symmetry.

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:43.500 align:middle line:90%


01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.330 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is called
the Z2 symmetry.

01:15:45.330 --> 01:15:48.480 align:middle line:90%


01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And there are also spacetime
discrete symmetries, OK?

01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:55.940 align:middle line:84%
So this is an internal discrete
symmetry-- have nothing

01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:57.740 align:middle line:90%
to do with spacetime, OK?

01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:00.170 align:middle line:84%
There are also spacetime
discrete symmetries.

01:16:00.170 --> 01:16:14.640 align:middle line:90%


01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:18.350 align:middle line:84%
So spacetime discrete symmetries
including, say, if we consider

01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:19.850 align:middle line:90%
Minkowski spacetime--

01:16:19.850 --> 01:16:27.610 align:middle line:90%


01:16:27.610 --> 01:16:30.820 align:middle line:84%
so you can have t
goes to minus t.

01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:38.300 align:middle line:84%
So you can have
so-called time reversal,

01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:44.110 align:middle line:84%
which corresponding to your
t, x goes to minus t, x, OK?

01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:47.050 align:middle line:90%
You just transform the time.

01:16:47.050 --> 01:16:49.095 align:middle line:84%
You can also have
the so-called parity.

01:16:49.095 --> 01:16:52.500 align:middle line:90%


01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:53.640 align:middle line:90%
You take t.

01:16:53.640 --> 01:17:00.315 align:middle line:84%
Then you revert all the
spatial direction, OK?

01:17:00.315 --> 01:17:09.000 align:middle line:90%


01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So comment that you
can ask why we actually

01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:16.230 align:middle line:90%
reverse all three directions.

01:17:16.230 --> 01:17:18.690 align:middle line:84%
How about if I just
reverse one direction

01:17:18.690 --> 01:17:21.060 align:middle line:90%
or reverse two directions, OK?

01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:23.910 align:middle line:84%
That seems also to be
a discrete symmetry.

01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:25.270 align:middle line:90%
And indeed.

01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you just change
the directions,

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:32.220 align:middle line:84%
say, in the x direction, that's
also a discrete symmetry.

01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you only
change the direction

01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:35.640 align:middle line:84%
in both x and the
y direction, that's

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:37.690 align:middle line:90%
also a discrete symmetry.

01:17:37.690 --> 01:17:42.510 align:middle line:90%
But if you change--

01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:46.870 align:middle line:84%
if you do the reflection
in two directions,

01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:49.840 align:middle line:84%
that's equivalent to
a 90-degree rotation--

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:57.670 align:middle line:84%
a 180-degree rotation
in that plane, OK?

01:17:57.670 --> 01:18:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And so it's part of the
continuous symmetries,

01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:06.200 align:middle line:84%
so it's not independent
discrete symmetry.

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And now, when you change all
three directions compared

01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:13.580 align:middle line:84%
to change one direction,
you differ only

01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:15.390 align:middle line:90%
by changing two directions.

01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:17.240 align:middle line:84%
So that means changing
all three directions

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:18.907 align:middle line:84%
and changing one
direction-- they differ

01:18:18.907 --> 01:18:21.380 align:middle line:90%
by 180-degree rotation, OK?

01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:23.060 align:middle line:84%
So that means that
when you change--

01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:29.040 align:middle line:84%
this is the only independent
discrete symmetry

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:33.150 align:middle line:84%
from the spatial
reflection point of view.

01:18:33.150 --> 01:18:35.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:40.030 align:middle line:90%
So for a complex scalar field--

01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:42.060 align:middle line:84%
so if you consider
complex scalar field--

01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:48.630 align:middle line:90%


01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:52.320 align:middle line:84%
if you can see the
complex scalar field,

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:57.380 align:middle line:84%
then this is no longer
a discrete symmetry

01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:01.220 align:middle line:84%
because, remember, we can
rotate phi by a phase.

01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:02.900 align:middle line:84%
When you rotate
the phi by a phase,

01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:04.970 align:middle line:84%
if you take that
phase to be pi--

01:19:04.970 --> 01:19:08.630 align:middle line:84%
say, exponential i pi-- and
then you take to be minus phi.

01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And so, in that
case, this is part

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.890 align:middle line:84%
of the continuous
symmetry, so it's no longer

01:19:12.890 --> 01:19:15.500 align:middle line:90%
independent discrete symmetry.

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.090 align:middle line:84%
But, here, there's,
nevertheless,

01:19:17.090 --> 01:19:19.910 align:middle line:90%
another discrete symmetry.

01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Can you see what is the other
independent discrete symmetry

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:23.880 align:middle line:90%
here?

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:25.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:19:25.690 --> 01:19:26.230 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:19:26.230 --> 01:19:30.430 align:middle line:84%
You can take phi
to phi star, OK?

01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:33.640 align:middle line:84%
You can exchange
phi to phi star, OK?

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:35.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a complex conjugation.

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is often called
charge conjugation.

01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:44.360 align:middle line:90%


01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:44.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:48.460 align:middle line:84%
This is often called charge
conjugation because, remember,

01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:53.270 align:middle line:84%
heuristically, we can
think of phi as create--

01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:55.270 align:middle line:84%
yeah, it's just one of
them create the particle,

01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and the other create
the antiparticle.

01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And they have
opposite charge, OK?

01:19:59.770 --> 01:20:01.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's called a
charge conjugation.

01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:05.470 align:middle line:84%
So, this, will give
a symbol called T--

01:20:05.470 --> 01:20:09.610 align:middle line:84%
script T. And, this, we give
a symbol called P-- script P.

01:20:09.610 --> 01:20:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And, this, we give a
symbol called script C. So,

01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:16.420 align:middle line:84%
altogether, they are
called CPT symmetry, OK?

01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:16.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let's stop here.

01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:23.000 align:middle line:90%
