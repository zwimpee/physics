00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.890 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: So let's start.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.680 align:middle line:84%
So let me just
clarify one question,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.570 align:middle line:90%
which was asked last time.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So when we calculate the
total cross-section for, say,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.730 align:middle line:84%
for this e plus e minus
to mu plus, mu minus,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.369 align:middle line:84%
then we find that
there's a funny fact --

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.430 align:middle line:90%
yeah, let me just write down--

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.820 align:middle line:84%
so then there's a
factor like this.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:48.140 align:middle line:84%
m prime square E squared
divided by m square e square

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.120 align:middle line:90%
and then times something else.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.300 align:middle line:90%
OK, so times something else.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And so there's funny feature
that this factor seems to blow

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.350 align:middle line:90%
up when the E is equal to m.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you decrease E
to the value of m--

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.660 align:middle line:84%
and then this
seemingly blows up, OK.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.530 align:middle line:84%
But of course this never
happens in the real situation

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.300 align:middle line:84%
because this mass is much
larger than this mass.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.270 align:middle line:84%
So the upstairs will go
to 0 before this blows up.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.110 align:middle line:84%
So that's why people never cared
about it, OK, including myself.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:84%
But you can ask the
question-- suppose

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.660 align:middle line:84%
the electron is more
massive than the muon

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.170 align:middle line:84%
and then you will reach
the 0s of this first

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.880 align:middle line:90%
before you reach the 0 of this.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And then you will see
something blows up.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.320 align:middle line:90%
OK, then it's curious.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.860 align:middle line:84%
There's a very simple
mathematical reason for this.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is that the
cross section is defined--

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.480 align:middle line:84%
remember, the cross
section is defined

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.160 align:middle line:84%
to be defined to be the
divided 1 over the flux.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.865 align:middle line:84%
And the flux is
proportional to 1 --

00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:03.600 align:middle line:84%
it is the density
times the velocity.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.640 align:middle line:90%
And the density is the same.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.370 align:middle line:84%
It's just one
particle per volume.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.180 align:middle line:90%
And then the velocity goes to 0.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.020 align:middle line:84%
This precisely comes when the
velocity goes to 0 because when

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.820 align:middle line:84%
the velocity becomes
very, very slow,

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.830 align:middle line:84%
then your flux become
very slow and small.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.900 align:middle line:90%
Then this becomes big.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.520 align:middle line:84%
So mathematically,
that's the reason

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.520 align:middle line:84%
why this becomes very big, OK,
when the velocity goes to 0.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.170 align:middle line:84%
But still it is a little
bit funny, I should admit.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.440 align:middle line:84%
So when the velocity equal
to 0, of course, it's

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.190 align:middle line:84%
unphysical because
when the velocity is 0,

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.680 align:middle line:90%
they just never scatter, OK.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So this divergence
is never an issue.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.040 align:middle line:84%
But you can ask the question
why physically somehow

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.080 align:middle line:84%
when you decrease the v and
somehow the cross section

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.700 align:middle line:90%
should become bigger and bigger?

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And the mathematically it's due
to the flux just due to the way

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.340 align:middle line:90%
the cross section is defined.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.660 align:middle line:84%
But I also mentioned before
that the cross section

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.240 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to measure
the effective area

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.410 align:middle line:90%
of the interaction.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And then why should that
depend on the velocity, OK?

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And so this aspect that I don't
have a very good explanation--

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.350 align:middle line:84%
but this is the
mathematical reason for it.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.280 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this is just
clarify the question

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.260 align:middle line:90%
over the last time.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, so then we talk
about crossing symmetry.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.960 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.380 align:middle line:90%
So let's consider two process.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.560 align:middle line:84%
One is the e plus e minus
goes to mu plus mu minus

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:84%
as we just discussed
with the Feynman diagram

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.030 align:middle line:90%
going like this.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.380 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.510 align:middle line:90%
So this is the--

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.390 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is the
e minus e plus.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.795 align:middle line:90%
This is mu minus mu plus, OK.

00:04:08.795 --> 00:04:12.210 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.910 align:middle line:90%
So there's also another process.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.645 align:middle line:84%
Let's consider another
process, which is e minus--

00:04:18.645 --> 00:04:21.230 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.650 align:middle line:84%
with mu minus going to
e minus plus mu minus.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.385 align:middle line:84%
And the Feynman diagram
for this is given by this.

00:04:29.385 --> 00:04:36.720 align:middle line:90%


00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is the
e minus and mu minus

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.280 align:middle line:90%
are at the initial state now.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:90%
And this is e minus.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.010 align:middle line:90%
And this is mu minus.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.260 align:middle line:84%
OK, again, only one
diagram contributes.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.420 align:middle line:90%


00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.620 align:middle line:84%
So if you compare a and
b, you can see that b--

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.070 align:middle line:84%
the diagram for b is
essentially the diagram for a

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.500 align:middle line:90%
if you view it sideways.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.260 align:middle line:84%
OK, if you view it
sideways-- and then you see

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.590 align:middle line:90%
this goes to that.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And then this
becomes final state.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And the final state
coming out e plus

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.010 align:middle line:90%
essentially becomes e minus.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.910 align:middle line:90%
And this just becomes that, OK.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.665 align:middle line:84%
So the difference between
these two is that the e plus--

00:05:21.665 --> 00:05:24.490 align:middle line:90%


00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:34.780 align:middle line:84%
so e plus in initial
state of a then

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:46.860 align:middle line:84%
goes to e minus in final state
of b, OK, in final state of B.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:06:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, the mu plus in
the final state of a then

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:16.166 align:middle line:84%
become the mu minus in
the initial state of b.

00:06:16.166 --> 00:06:19.290 align:middle line:90%


00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:24.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so essentially, mu plus--

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.680 align:middle line:84%
essentially, you take the e
plus going to the other side

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.290 align:middle line:90%
become e minus and then take--

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.680 align:middle line:84%
mu plus going to this
side become mu minus, OK.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So essentially you
just exchange that.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:42.400 align:middle line:84%
So now let's label
the quantum numbers.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.890 align:middle line:90%
Let's call this p1, r1.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.410 align:middle line:90%


00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:90%
So this is-- call it p2, r2.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.885 align:middle line:90%
And call this one--

00:06:57.885 --> 00:07:01.680 align:middle line:90%


00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.910 align:middle line:90%
Call this k1, s1.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.800 align:middle line:90%
So these are the polarization.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:90%
And this is k2, s2.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And now similarly I
label here by p1, r1.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.280 align:middle line:90%
Label this one by p2, r2 bar.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.550 align:middle line:90%
So this is for the antiparticle.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:30.900 align:middle line:90%
And so this one would be k1, s1.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.755 align:middle line:84%
And then this will
be k2, s2 bar, OK.

00:07:34.755 --> 00:07:39.270 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:51.972 align:middle line:84%
So now if we look at this map,
so it's like in the process A,

00:07:51.972 --> 00:07:59.860 align:middle line:84%
we take this to be
initial state, p2, r2.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:05.980 align:middle line:84%
If we replace it
by minus k2, s2--

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.990 align:middle line:90%
OK, minus k2 means that the--

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.060 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so this one e plus
now becomes the final state.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.410 align:middle line:90%
So this is the--

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.980 align:middle line:84%
so from the momentum direction,
this is the going in.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.280 align:middle line:90%
And this will be going out.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.190 align:middle line:90%
So we need to change the sign.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:25.270 align:middle line:84%
OK, we to change the
sign and, similarly,

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:40.919 align:middle line:84%
the k2 for s2 for k2, s2 bar
and then go to minus p2, r2.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:44.610 align:middle line:90%


00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:50.932 align:middle line:84%
If you make this placement,
then we get the process b, OK.

00:08:50.932 --> 00:08:52.620 align:middle line:90%
You get the process b.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.410 align:middle line:84%
So you just make
the replacement.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And then the process in a will
go through the process in b.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:02.370 align:middle line:90%


00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.250 align:middle line:84%
So suppose you forget
about those polarizations.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:10.620 align:middle line:84%
If we consider how we're
talking about the scalar

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.510 align:middle line:84%
particles-- so there's
no polarization.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.210 align:middle line:90%
And then this just trivially--

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:18.370 align:middle line:84%
so for scalar, then we
just have trivially--

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:25.130 align:middle line:90%


00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:26.900 align:middle line:90%
We can just do the replacement.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:33.870 align:middle line:84%
You can trivially see that
the amplitude for the process

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:43.820 align:middle line:84%
a with p1 minus k2
and the k1 minus p2

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.580 align:middle line:84%
then will be just equal to
the amplitude for the process

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:52.520 align:middle line:90%
b with p1, p2, k1, k2.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:59.300 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we just rename your
momentum of your process a.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And then you will just get
essentially the amplitude

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.200 align:middle line:84%
for two p because the
only thing you need to do

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.140 align:middle line:84%
is just exchange the
name of the momentum, OK.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.450 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So then we'll be
trivially the same.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:24.770 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:35.620 align:middle line:84%
But for fermions, we
should worry about--

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:41.130 align:middle line:90%


00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:48.915 align:middle line:84%
also look at the wave function
associated with external legs.

00:10:48.915 --> 00:11:01.575 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.575 --> 00:11:04.550 align:middle line:90%
OK, so in a--

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.760 align:middle line:84%
let me just write down those
wave function explicitly.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:16.400 align:middle line:84%
So in a, so the p2, r2 bar
are associated with the wave

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:22.590 align:middle line:90%
function is to be v bar r2, p2.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.185 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this is for the e plus.

00:11:24.185 --> 00:11:28.940 align:middle line:90%


00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And the k2, s2 bar are
related to v s2, k2.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is related
to the mu plus.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:43.880 align:middle line:84%
OK, so according to
our previous rule--

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:50.650 align:middle line:84%
but in b the wave
function for these two--

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:58.350 align:middle line:84%
so the k2, s2, so the
corresponding one is--

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:04.200 align:middle line:84%
the one you want to
exchange is u s2 bar, k2.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:10.980 align:middle line:84%
This is corresponding to
e minus and the p2, r2.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's corresponding
to u r2, p2, mu minus.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:23.250 align:middle line:84%
So now you see even when
you make the label change--

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:27.460 align:middle line:84%
suppose you make the label
replacement from here

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.050 align:middle line:90%
to replace by that.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:33.400 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to change
the wave function from v to u.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.620 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the wave function
actually is different.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:41.260 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.240 align:middle line:90%
So similarly this does not--

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.775 align:middle line:84%
so this does not work if
you have fermions, OK,

00:12:45.775 --> 00:12:48.820 align:middle line:84%
if I have fermions, because
the function changes.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:54.430 align:middle line:84%
It changes from v to u, in
this case here again also

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:55.720 align:middle line:90%
v to u, OK.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.300 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.080 align:middle line:84%
But actually this
is another problem

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:07.070 align:middle line:84%
if we consider the unpolarized
spin sum actually still works,

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:10.520 align:middle line:90%
OK, for unpolarized.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an
unpolarized situation--

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:18.290 align:middle line:90%


00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.330 align:middle line:84%
remember, we need to
sum over all the spins.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:24.050 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:28.275 align:middle line:84%
And consider M squared,
sum of all the spins, OK.

00:13:28.275 --> 00:13:31.290 align:middle line:90%


00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.960 align:middle line:84%
so we will involve
this y sum with itself.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.460 align:middle line:84%
For example, when you
sum of all the r2s,

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.160 align:middle line:84%
then we will have
something like this.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.830 align:middle line:90%


00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:46.200 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, we
need to sum over r2,

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:51.835 align:middle line:84%
then we will have a
combination like v, r2, p2--

00:13:51.835 --> 00:13:53.800 align:middle line:84%
that's the calculation
we did before--

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.390 align:middle line:90%
and v, r2, bar, p2, OK.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And then this one will give
you just minus i p2, slash,

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:12.090 align:middle line:90%
plus m of the electron, OK.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.085 align:middle line:84%
And now you can just
do the replacement.

00:14:16.085 --> 00:14:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Let's just do what
was written --

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:21.390 align:middle line:90%
the p2 replace it by minus k2.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:23.340 align:middle line:84%
So if you do the
replacement, then that

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:32.590 align:middle line:84%
goes to minus i, slash, k2 plus
still the electron mass, OK.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And then this is the same as the
sum s2, u, s2, k2, u, s2, bar,

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.840 align:middle line:90%
k2, OK.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So despite that the wave
function are different, OK--

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.400 align:middle line:90%
so the wave function.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.190 align:middle line:84%
But after you do the spin
sum, OK, they actually

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:01.820 align:middle line:90%
get the same answer, OK.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:05.480 align:middle line:84%
So this is the same
as the minus this one.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:10.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, so in this case after
you do the spin sum--

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:20.100 align:middle line:84%
so each replacement
of momentum--

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:27.890 align:middle line:84%
so in this case just
give us a minus sign,

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:34.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, when you calculate
this spin sum, m squared.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:39.240 align:middle line:84%
But now since we need to
replace two of them, OK--

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.905 align:middle line:84%
so 2 minus sine is
a positive sign.

00:15:40.905 --> 00:15:48.200 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.200 --> 00:16:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So we conclude that the sum
over spin Ma squared evaluated

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:09.760 align:middle line:84%
at p1 minus k2
and k1 minus p2 is

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:15.820 align:middle line:84%
the same as the sum over spin,
the amplitude for b squared

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:21.640 align:middle line:90%
divided p1, p2, k1, k2, OK.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:26.290 align:middle line:84%
So there's a simple relation
between the amplitude square

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:29.230 align:middle line:84%
when you do the spin
sum, and we just

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.110 align:middle line:90%
need to rename the momentum, OK.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:33.250 align:middle line:90%
Rename the momentum.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:39.170 align:middle line:90%


00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.080 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.670 align:middle line:90%
So for unpolarized amplitude--

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.220 align:middle line:84%
so we still have this
very nice relation

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:90%
between these two process, OK.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.268 align:middle line:84%
If you calculated
one of them, then you

00:16:57.268 --> 00:16:58.685 align:middle line:84%
don't need to
calculate the other.

00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:01.160 align:middle line:84%
You can just immediately
get the answer.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.510 align:middle line:84%
You just change a few momenta,
change a couple momenta.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:08.770 align:middle line:90%


00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:13.100 align:middle line:84%
But if you consider the
polarized amplitude--

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:24.640 align:middle line:90%


00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.180 align:middle line:84%
So the story is now
is much simpler.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Now you do have a problem
because now the wavefunction

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.410 align:middle line:90%
are different, OK.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:41.815 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, you can
choose a different basis, OK.

00:17:41.815 --> 00:17:44.710 align:middle line:90%


00:17:44.710 --> 00:18:10.542 align:middle line:84%
By choosing appropriate basis,
you can still directly relate

00:18:10.542 --> 00:18:12.110 align:middle line:90%
--

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:13.505 align:middle line:90%
equate the amplitudes, OK.

00:18:13.505 --> 00:18:21.690 align:middle line:90%


00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.540 align:middle line:84%
You can still recreate
the amplitude.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, so, yeah, I will
not go into there, OK.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:33.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's possible, say,
you choose a basis of v2

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:38.780 align:middle line:84%
and the u2 and u and then
somehow you can relate them

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.190 align:middle line:90%
to each other, OK.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:48.861 align:middle line:84%
So this relation between
the amplitude of a and b--

00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:52.170 align:middle line:84%
so this is called
crossing symmetry.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let me just
call this star.

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So star is called
crossing symmetry.

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:04.200 align:middle line:90%


00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.440 align:middle line:84%
So calling it
symmetry is actually

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle line:84%
a misnomer because this
is not a symmetry, OK.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.330 align:middle line:84%
This is just a relation
between the amplitudes

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:16.710 align:middle line:90%
of different process.

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:19.410 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this is not a symmetry.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:22.980 align:middle line:84%
So the symmetry should
be put as quotes, OK.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.740 align:middle line:84%
So this just express the
relation of one amplitude

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.690 align:middle line:84%
to the relation of
another amplitude.

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just relation between
the amplitude of one

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:35.690 align:middle line:84%
process to the amplitude
of another process.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And the relation come
from a fundamental fact,

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:43.685 align:middle line:90%
come from a very simple fact--

00:19:43.685 --> 00:19:56.380 align:middle line:90%


00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.680 align:middle line:84%
OK, so if we consider this
fermionic field, psi--

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:05.090 align:middle line:90%


00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:07.880 align:middle line:90%
so psi can play two role.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:14.825 align:middle line:90%
It can either annihilate--

00:20:14.825 --> 00:20:22.620 align:middle line:90%


00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:29.230 align:middle line:84%
remember psi is called
a plus b dagger, OK.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:32.840 align:middle line:90%
It's called a plus b dagger.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:37.120 align:middle line:84%
So you can either annihilate
an initial particle--

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:43.520 align:middle line:90%


00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.875 align:middle line:90%
so that's the a part--

00:20:44.875 --> 00:20:47.620 align:middle line:90%


00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:56.020 align:middle line:84%
or can create an
initial antiparticle

00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:00.250 align:middle line:90%
or create, sorry, a final--

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.050 align:middle line:90%
sorry, an antiparticle.

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:90%


00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:14.070 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let me just elaborate.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:20.171 align:middle line:84%
So if we have a, when
you act on this side--

00:21:20.171 --> 00:21:24.276 align:middle line:84%
when you act on this
side, you only have--

00:21:24.276 --> 00:21:26.310 align:middle line:84%
if you have a particle
in the initial state,

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:29.560 align:middle line:84%
then a can annihilate
that particle.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.860 align:middle line:84%
But if a acts on the
left, act on the left,

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.380 align:middle line:90%
a becomes a dagger.

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.537 align:middle line:84%
And then that creates
an antiparticle.

00:21:38.537 --> 00:21:45.330 align:middle line:90%


00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so in such a process,
X plus a goes to Y.

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:56.310 align:middle line:90%
And then you can just--

00:21:56.310 --> 00:22:00.490 align:middle line:84%
so this relates to-- the X
and Y are some combination,

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:01.950 align:middle line:90%
some combination of particles.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:03.780 align:middle line:90%
And then this just relates to--

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:13.510 align:middle line:90%


00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:19.585 align:middle line:90%
X goes to Y plus a bar, OK.

00:22:19.585 --> 00:22:24.770 align:middle line:90%


00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:29.200 align:middle line:84%
So here just X and Y, some
collection of particles.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:49.270 align:middle line:90%


00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, a's just some particle,
OK OK, so just confirm that, OK.

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:02.850 align:middle line:90%


00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:03.350 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:04.685 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:23:04.685 --> 00:23:05.185 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:05.185 --> 00:23:10.090 align:middle line:90%


00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.370 align:middle line:90%
e minus all mu.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:16.090 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just say you
have one field for e.

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:17.220 align:middle line:90%
You have one field for mu.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.140 align:middle line:90%


00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:20.860 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.775 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:23.775 --> 00:23:37.937 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.937 --> 00:23:38.645 align:middle line:90%

00:23:38.645 --> 00:23:41.660 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.205 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Sorry, say it again.

00:23:43.205 --> 00:23:50.210 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: The process, like
for y, can we think of it as--

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:54.890 align:middle line:84%
first, X to Y and
a bar then a bar,

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:57.230 align:middle line:84%
like annihilate or do
something like that?

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.360 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
heuristically you may--

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.530 align:middle line:90%
but it's simpler than that.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:04.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's simpler than that.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.200 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Just regarding
energy conservation.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you can keep
doing that can't we just

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:16.423 align:middle line:84%
say that like out of nothing
comes Y plus a bar plus X bar.

00:24:16.423 --> 00:24:17.840 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so that's why you

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.540 align:middle line:90%
have to change the momentum.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:25.700 align:middle line:84%
So some momentum
for this process.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Corresponding to some
momentum for that process.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we have to switch the
initial and final momentum.

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's not to say these
two processes are the same.

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.860 align:middle line:84%
It's just that this process
for one set of momentum

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:45.520 align:middle line:84%
have the same amplitude
as the other process

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.637 align:middle line:90%
for some other set of momentum.

00:24:47.637 --> 00:24:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's a
relation between them.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:55.210 align:middle line:90%


00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:58.020 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:04.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now let's consider
another important process

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:06.170 align:middle line:90%
called Compton scattering.

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:12.050 align:middle line:90%


00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:15.710 align:middle line:84%
So Compton scattering
played a very important role

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:22.610 align:middle line:84%
in the early days of physics and
in showing that actually this

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:25.490 align:middle line:84%
is one of the early
experiments to show

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:28.100 align:middle line:84%
that the macroscopic
world is governed

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:31.930 align:middle line:84%
by quantum mechanics rather
than classical mechanics.

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:37.615 align:middle line:84%
So now let's consider
how to calculate

00:25:37.615 --> 00:25:40.510 align:middle line:90%
the physics for this process.

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:41.950 align:middle line:84%
So Compton scattering
is a process

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:46.420 align:middle line:84%
you have a photon
hit the electron.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.790 align:middle line:90%
And then you get another photon.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
another electron, OK.

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And so we can draw the
Feynman diagram for it.

00:25:57.450 --> 00:25:59.160 align:middle line:84%
So one Feynman diagrams
is the following.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's just imagine you have
a fermionic trajectory.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:08.350 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine at some point
there's a photon coming in.

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:11.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is
the electron line.

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:14.658 align:middle line:84%
So the electron line, the
arrow is the charge line.

00:26:14.658 --> 00:26:16.950 align:middle line:84%
So the photon line, the arrow
should be understood just

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:18.150 align:middle line:90%
as a momentum, OK.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And then you emit another
photon as a final state, OK.

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is the simplest Feynman
diagram for this process.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:37.230 align:middle line:84%
But actually there are two
diagrams because you can also--

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:45.330 align:middle line:84%
for this electron line, you
can also first emit a photon

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and then absorb a photon
can also have that, OK.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:52.960 align:middle line:90%
So you have two.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:58.855 align:middle line:84%
And these two processes
are not the same, OK.

00:26:58.855 --> 00:27:07.070 align:middle line:84%
So now let me put some
label on the diagram.

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:10.960 align:middle line:84%
So, again, the
fermion is p1, r1.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:14.800 align:middle line:84%
So electron, initial
state, and let's

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.150 align:middle line:84%
put its final
state to be k1, s1.

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:20.060 align:middle line:90%


00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And the photon, let's put its
initial state to be p2, alpha.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:31.880 align:middle line:84%
So alpha now is a
polarization for the photon.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.910 align:middle line:90%
And so call it alpha 1.

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And then this one is
called k2, alpha 2.

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And then label this index
to be nu and this index

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:53.900 align:middle line:84%
to be mu, OK, because
the photon carry a vector

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.930 align:middle line:84%
index because the polarization
carry a vector index.

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:58.530 align:middle line:90%
So there's mu here.

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:02.420 align:middle line:90%


00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.700 align:middle line:84%
So I always imagine
the momentum is

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.430 align:middle line:84%
coming in for the initial
state and the momentum come out

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:10.130 align:middle line:90%
for the final states, OK.

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And for this diagram,
it's the same thing.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.730 align:middle line:90%
So I have p1.

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:16.430 align:middle line:90%
So I label the p1, r1.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:20.890 align:middle line:90%
So this is the p2 alpha 1.

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:24.010 align:middle line:90%
And so this is k1, s1.

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:27.700 align:middle line:90%
And this is k2, alpha 2.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:32.440 align:middle line:84%
The only difference is the
role of mu and nu is switched.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.640 align:middle line:90%
So for the out leg is mu.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.780 align:middle line:90%
So mu now is here.

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:39.470 align:middle line:90%
And this one is nu here, OK.

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So nu is associated polarization
of the incoming photon.

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And the mu is the
polarization associated

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.840 align:middle line:90%
with the outgoing photon.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.350 align:middle line:90%
So this is my Feynman diagram.

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:54.800 align:middle line:90%


00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So this process
compared to the one

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:02.340 align:middle line:84%
we considered, this
e plus, e minus 1.

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.170 align:middle line:90%
So these have some new elements.

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:14.825 align:middle line:84%
So that's why this is a
good example to look at.

00:29:14.825 --> 00:29:17.550 align:middle line:90%


00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:20.070 align:middle line:90%
There are two new elements.

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:23.850 align:middle line:84%
First, in this
example, we have--

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.220 align:middle line:84%
so this propogator
is a fermionic one.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:31.140 align:middle line:84%
So now we have a intermediate
fermionic propagator, OK.

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.100 align:middle line:90%
And the momentum for this one--

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:42.160 align:middle line:84%
so let's call it q1
equal to k1 plus k2.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.810 align:middle line:90%
So this is p1 plus p2.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:49.020 align:middle line:90%


00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.872 align:middle line:84%
But this one will have
a different momentum.

00:29:51.872 --> 00:29:56.390 align:middle line:90%
So here let's call it q2.

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:58.060 align:middle line:84%
So what's the
momentum for this one?

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:04.110 align:middle line:90%


00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:08.870 align:middle line:84%
If I draw the momentum
going to the up?

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:12.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so let me put it here.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So what would be the
momentum this one?

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:17.220 align:middle line:90%
Let's go with q2.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.270 align:middle line:90%


00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:23.477 align:middle line:84%
Can you read the momentum
of this intermediate line

00:30:23.477 --> 00:30:24.185 align:middle line:90%
from the diagram?

00:30:24.185 --> 00:30:27.340 align:middle line:90%


00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's p1 minus k2 because
we have p1 coming in and then

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.090 align:middle line:90%
k2 come out.

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:36.460 align:middle line:90%
So that's the momentum, OK.

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.290 align:middle line:90%
So in this one, you have p1.

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the p2 coming in.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.500 align:middle line:90%
And so this is p1 plus p2.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:47.460 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the new
element is that now we

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.925 align:middle line:84%
have a fermionic propagator
as an intermediate state.

00:30:50.925 --> 00:30:57.060 align:middle line:90%


00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And the second
new element is now

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.355 align:middle line:84%
we have photon in
the external state.

00:31:02.355 --> 00:31:10.040 align:middle line:90%


00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:13.213 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is a new element
compared to this e plus,

00:31:13.213 --> 00:31:13.880 align:middle line:90%
e minus example.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:18.650 align:middle line:90%


00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:21.080 align:middle line:84%
But still using
our previous rule,

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:25.470 align:middle line:84%
we can immediately write
down the amplitude, OK.

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:27.255 align:middle line:84%
I think I may not
have enough space.

00:31:27.255 --> 00:31:30.630 align:middle line:90%


00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:32.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let me try--

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.810 align:middle line:90%
so let me start from here.

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:36.330 align:middle line:90%


00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:42.210 align:middle line:84%
So the amplitude,
again, the i times the--

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:44.340 align:middle line:90%
this i is not important.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:50.070 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, let
me just write it down.

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:54.310 align:middle line:90%
So the amplitude is given by--

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:59.410 align:middle line:84%
so we follow-- you see we
follow the fermionic line.

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:02.790 align:middle line:84%
So here there's one
fermionic line, OK.

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And so we should follow
that fermionic line.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And then we also have
the photon polarization.

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:13.770 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's first write
down the photon polarization.

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:16.890 align:middle line:84%
So for this photon final
state, then we just

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:30.870 align:middle line:84%
have epsilon, mu, alpha
2, star, so k2, OK.

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:33.420 align:middle line:84%
So, remember, for the
photon in the final state,

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.880 align:middle line:90%
we need to put the star.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And also, remember, the mu
is associated with the photon

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:41.470 align:middle line:90%
in the final state.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And then we have epsilon
nu for the initial state

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:48.920 align:middle line:90%
of the photon, alpha 1, then k1.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is the photon one,
OK, photon polarization factor.

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And now we need to
write down the--

00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:00.500 align:middle line:84%
so these two factors are
the same for both processes.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, for both processes
we are not changing

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:05.150 align:middle line:90%
the external photon state, OK.

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So these two factors
are the same, OK.

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:11.150 align:middle line:90%


00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:14.020 align:middle line:90%
And now the rest--

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:15.820 align:middle line:84%
so now let's look
at this diagram

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.680 align:middle line:90%
and follow this fermionic line.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:22.680 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we start with here
and then going backwards.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So we just have u, bar,
s1, k1 for this electron

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.050 align:middle line:90%
in the final state.

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:33.810 align:middle line:90%
And then we have fermionic--

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:40.515 align:middle line:84%
and then we have this vertex
should be minus ie, gamma mu.

00:33:40.515 --> 00:33:43.410 align:middle line:84%
All this order is important
because they are all matrices,

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:43.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.730 align:middle line:90%
They all have spinner indices.

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:47.310 align:middle line:90%
And so this is a matrix.

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And then we have this fermionic
propagator, which is minus 1,

00:33:54.990 --> 00:34:01.400 align:middle line:90%
i q1 slash.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So I just write down
the fermionic propagator

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:08.590 align:middle line:90%
minus m plus i epsilon, OK.

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:13.940 align:middle line:84%
So I did the final state,
intermediate propagator,

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:19.280 align:middle line:90%
and then I have another vertex.

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.440 align:middle line:90%
And now it's nu.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.880 align:middle line:90%
And then I have the final.

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:30.210 align:middle line:90%


00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:35.989 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's that diagram.

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:37.260 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's the diagram.

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And now for this diagram,
we do the same thing.

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:42.670 align:middle line:90%


00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:44.590 align:middle line:84%
So the final state,
again, is the same.

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:47.270 align:middle line:90%


00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:54.170 align:middle line:90%
It's the u, s1, bar, k1.

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:56.670 align:middle line:84%
But now here you
have ie gamma nu.

00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:59.360 align:middle line:90%


00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:04.440 align:middle line:90%
So now the order changed, OK.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.400 align:middle line:90%
And then you have the photon--

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.780 align:middle line:84%
then you have this
fermionic propagator,

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:14.010 align:middle line:84%
which is i q2 slash
plus m minus epsilon.

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:16.640 align:middle line:90%


00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And then you have minus
i e gamma mu from here.

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
final state u r1, p1, OK.

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:35.258 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:35:35.258 --> 00:35:37.550 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Where did you get
these two Feynman diagrams,

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:42.345 align:middle line:84%
by doing [INAUDIBLE] which
one gets absorbed or--

00:35:42.345 --> 00:35:43.845 align:middle line:84%
but if we were
working with photons.

00:35:43.845 --> 00:35:45.060 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't it matter.

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:48.750 align:middle line:84%
This seems like the
real difference is not

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:52.530 align:middle line:84%
the kinematic difference
of which one gets absorbed.

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:55.620 align:middle line:84%
It's the fact that we
have this vector that

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:58.440 align:middle line:84%
describes with this polarization
through the photons, right?

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.260 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, these are
just two inequivalent Feynman

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:04.090 align:middle line:90%
diagrams, inequivalent.

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:09.802 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: But that's because of
mu and nu, because they don't--

00:36:09.802 --> 00:36:12.420 align:middle line:84%
when you were writing
down the Feynman diagram.

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:17.250 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, no,
no, even not for--

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:21.030 align:middle line:84%
even they are not vectors, still
they are inequivalent diagrams.

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Because the momentum
here is different.

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:26.530 align:middle line:90%
The momentum here is different.

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So they're still an
inequivalent diagram.

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.690 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:35.420 align:middle line:90%
So these are the amplitude.

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:38.980 align:middle line:84%
So again, we look at
unpolarized cross section.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:37:07.270 align:middle line:90%


00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:09.205 align:middle line:90%
So unpolarized cross section.

00:37:09.205 --> 00:37:13.230 align:middle line:90%


00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:17.850 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the
unpolarized situation.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:21.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, so, again, we need to
average over the initial spin

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:24.050 align:middle line:90%
and sum over the final spin.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:26.060 align:middle line:84%
So here now the
difference is now

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:30.470 align:middle line:84%
we need to average also over
sum over the index for alpha

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:33.260 align:middle line:90%
and for alpha 1 and alpha 2.

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So alpha 1 and alpha 2, they
only have two polarization.

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:42.170 align:middle line:84%
So, again, when you
average over the alpha 1,

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:44.090 align:middle line:90%
you get a factor of 1/2, OK.

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:52.080 align:middle line:84%
So still we get just a factor
of 1 quarter sum over all

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.290 align:middle line:90%
the spins of M squared.

00:37:55.290 --> 00:38:03.970 align:middle line:84%
So this is just the same as sum
over, say, alpha 1, alpha 2,

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:09.160 align:middle line:90%
r1, r2, OK, M squared.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And each index take value 1 and
2, OK, because the photon also

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.027 align:middle line:90%
only have two polarizations.

00:38:16.027 --> 00:38:19.370 align:middle line:90%


00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:23.630 align:middle line:84%
So now I will not do a
complete calculation of this.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:26.530 align:middle line:90%
OK, so you just square it.

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:28.350 align:middle line:90%
So you use the trick.

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:30.900 align:middle line:90%
And you just square it.

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And then you just
try to calculate it.

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.670 align:middle line:90%
And now you calculate this guy.

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Now we need to use
some more tricks, OK.

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So I will just explain what
are the new tricks needed

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.450 align:middle line:90%
to compute this guy.

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:47.615 align:middle line:84%
And we will not actually
do a calculation, OK.

00:38:47.615 --> 00:38:50.330 align:middle line:90%
I'll do a general calculation.

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:52.190 align:middle line:84%
So the new elements
we need to use--

00:38:52.190 --> 00:39:00.160 align:middle line:90%


00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:11.620 align:middle line:84%
so a few new tricks in order to
do this, to do the calculation.

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:17.600 align:middle line:90%


00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.600 align:middle line:84%
So the first trick
is how you treat

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.850 align:middle line:90%
this fermionic propagator.

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:25.530 align:middle line:90%


00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:27.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, so how you treat the
fermionic propagator.

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:30.650 align:middle line:90%


00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:33.530 align:middle line:90%
So we can just rewrite--

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:37.770 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so this is the
inverse of a matrix.

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:40.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, so we can just do the--

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:49.700 align:middle line:84%
we say maybe has a propagator
like this, i k slash,

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:53.120 align:middle line:90%
plus m, plus epsilon.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:57.065 align:middle line:84%
This will not worry about
epsilon because the downstairs

00:39:57.065 --> 00:40:02.130 align:middle line:84%
neighbor 0-- so this is the
same as i k slash plus m,

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:06.790 align:middle line:90%
k squared plus m squared, OK.

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:09.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just because of
the familiar relation

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:16.360 align:middle line:84%
we used before that ik slash
plus m and ik slash minus m is

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:20.510 align:middle line:84%
equal to minus k
squared minus m squared.

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:22.090 align:middle line:90%
OK, so you can just--

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:25.780 align:middle line:84%
then the inverse of this matrix
is just given by this matrix.

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, I think here
should be minus sign.

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:36.050 align:middle line:84%
The inverse of this matrix
is given by that matrix, OK.

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:40.060 align:middle line:84%
So then you can use
this to simplify.

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Then you can use to simplify
that expression a little bit,

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:44.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:47.660 align:middle line:90%
So this is the first thing used.

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.490 align:middle line:90%
And the second thing used--

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:52.900 align:middle line:90%


00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:54.150 align:middle line:90%
is when doing the spin sum.

00:40:54.150 --> 00:41:02.060 align:middle line:90%


00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So for fermions, for spinors
we use the same trick

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:23.270 align:middle line:84%
as before as the one we
used for the last example.

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:26.800 align:middle line:84%
But for photons, there
are some new elements, OK.

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.975 align:middle line:84%
So now let's discuss how
we treat the photons.

00:41:28.975 --> 00:41:33.640 align:middle line:90%


00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:34.900 align:middle line:90%
So now I treat photons.

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And the way to treat
the photons actually

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:39.310 align:middle line:90%
involves some important physics.

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:44.270 align:middle line:84%
So let me explain a
little bit how we do that.

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:45.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:51.030 align:middle line:84%
So now if you look at the
structure of this amplitude--

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:53.820 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's focus on
one of the photons.

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:59.460 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the
final photon, OK.

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:03.728 align:middle line:84%
So the polarization
has the following form.

00:42:03.728 --> 00:42:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this just look
at one of the photons.

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.350 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Say, let's look at this
one, initial photon.

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And then the amplitude--
then you have this.

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Then the whole
amplitude is scalar.

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:21.140 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the amplitude
then has the structure.

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:25.090 align:middle line:90%


00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:28.350 align:middle line:90%
They have epsilon nu star --

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:33.270 align:middle line:90%
nu alpha -- times M nu.

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:35.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, just say this
is the polarization.

00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And the rest I just call it
M nu because the index has

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:43.910 align:middle line:90%
to be contracted, OK.

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:45.535 align:middle line:90%
So now I do the spin sum.

00:42:45.535 --> 00:42:48.750 align:middle line:90%


00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:58.500 align:middle line:84%
So if I now some of nu to
the spin sum over the alpha,

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:02.910 align:middle line:84%
and then I just have alpha
equal to 1, 2 to the spin

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:04.440 align:middle line:90%
sum relevant for the alpha.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.000 align:middle line:90%
I just have alpha 1, 2.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And then I have epsilon nu alpha
star, alpha nu alpha, alpha

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:26.930 align:middle line:84%
mu star, alpha nu, alpha,
and then I have M mu star

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:28.700 align:middle line:90%
and have M nu.

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.590 align:middle line:84%
OK, I just take
the square of it.

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:36.150 align:middle line:90%


00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:39.210 align:middle line:84%
So now to do the spin sum,
we looked at this object.

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:44.050 align:middle line:90%


00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:45.520 align:middle line:84%
OK, I need to look
at this object.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:52.690 align:middle line:90%


00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:56.350 align:middle line:84%
So do you remember what
is the sum of this object?

00:43:56.350 --> 00:44:02.940 align:middle line:90%


00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, exactly, the
transverse projector.

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:11.430 align:middle line:84%
OK, because of the physical
photon polarization

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:16.320 align:middle line:84%
is projected to the
transverse space, OK.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:20.020 align:middle line:84%
So this gives you the
transverse projector.

00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:22.150 align:middle line:90%
But now I claim--

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:34.480 align:middle line:84%
OK, so if you do the alpha
1, 2, mu, alpha star,

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:37.930 align:middle line:84%
nu, alpha-- so this gives
you the transverse projector.

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:41.720 align:middle line:90%


00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.310 align:middle line:90%
But now the claim--

00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:46.220 align:middle line:84%
but transverse projector
is a little bit

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:47.930 align:middle line:90%
awkward to work with, OK.

00:44:47.930 --> 00:45:01.050 align:middle line:84%
But the claim, you
said actually I

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:11.390 align:middle line:84%
can replace the sum of alpha
equal to 1, 2 by actually sum

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:19.190 align:middle line:84%
over alpha for all
polarizations, OK.

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:24.080 align:middle line:84%
So now when I sum of
all polarizations--

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:30.592 align:middle line:84%
so if I sum of all alpha,
then now do what is this?

00:45:30.592 --> 00:45:31.800 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember what is this?

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:38.660 align:middle line:90%


00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:40.970 align:middle line:90%
You just get eta mu nu.

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:44.000 align:middle line:84%
OK, and this one
is much simpler.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.200 align:middle line:90%
So now the claim--

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:52.510 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now the claim is that
we can just simply replace

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:55.560 align:middle line:90%
this sum by eta mu nu.

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.704 align:middle line:84%
OK, we can replace
this by eta mu nu.

00:45:57.704 --> 00:46:03.710 align:middle line:90%


00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:06.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so this is the claim.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this amounts
to the following.

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:13.380 align:middle line:90%


00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So this is equivalent
to the following.

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:21.640 align:middle line:90%


00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:24.820 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at the
difference between these two--

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.320 align:middle line:84%
so now if you look
at the difference

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:29.740 align:middle line:84%
between the alpha equal to
sum over 1, 2 and the alpha

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:32.250 align:middle line:90%
sum over all here--

00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:34.295 align:middle line:84%
so the difference
in other words--

00:46:34.295 --> 00:46:46.160 align:middle line:90%


00:46:46.160 --> 00:47:02.880 align:middle line:84%
we claim that sum
alpha equal to 0

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:16.470 align:middle line:84%
and 3 epsilon alpha
star mu and alpha nu

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:21.900 align:middle line:90%
alpha M mu M nu to be 0, OK.

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:24.550 align:middle line:90%


00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So the difference between the
2 is just from sum 0 to 3, OK.

00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:30.610 align:middle line:90%
So in other words--

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:33.910 align:middle line:84%
so if I write down
this explicitly--

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:35.960 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this corresponding to--

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:39.650 align:middle line:90%


00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:47.990 align:middle line:84%
so this corresponding to 0,
epsilon mu, 0, M mu squared

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:57.240 align:middle line:84%
is equal to epsilon
mu 3 M mu squared, OK.

00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:00.270 align:middle line:90%


00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:04.420 align:middle line:84%
So this claim, you see
equivalent to this claim.

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:09.240 align:middle line:84%
OK, so these two will
cancel each other.

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:12.300 align:middle line:84%
The equal here is
because the signature,

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.535 align:middle line:84%
the zeroth component,
there's a minus sign, OK.

00:48:14.535 --> 00:48:17.820 align:middle line:90%


00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:19.710 align:middle line:84%
So it tells you that
the sum of these two

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:23.640 align:middle line:84%
actually will cancel
each other, OK.

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:27.980 align:middle line:84%
So now let me remind
you how we choose the--

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:32.180 align:middle line:84%
yeah, now let me try
to prove this fact.

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:37.380 align:middle line:84%
OK, turns out this fact is
actually very important.

00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:40.100 align:middle line:90%


00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:43.490 align:middle line:84%
It contains very important
physics here, OK.

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So do you have any
questions before I do that?

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:51.830 align:middle line:90%


00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:54.310 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So now let me try to
show this is true, OK.

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So let me just remind
you of a convention

00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:10.630 align:middle line:84%
is that epsilon mu 0 is equal
to just 0, just 1, 0 and mu

00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:18.250 align:middle line:84%
3 is equal to 0 and then
in the direction of the k.

00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:21.040 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's in the
direction of the k.

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:25.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, and the epsilon mu 1, 2 will
be orthogonal to both of them,

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:28.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Be orthogonal to
both of them, OK.

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.810 align:middle line:84%
So now to see this
equation, let me

00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:39.220 align:middle line:90%
call this equation star, star.

00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:49.250 align:middle line:90%


00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:52.850 align:middle line:84%
So let's consider just a
general physical process.

00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:55.570 align:middle line:90%


00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:58.750 align:middle line:84%
We can actually make
a general statement,

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:02.240 align:middle line:84%
OK, not just restricted
to that particular example

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:03.290 align:middle line:90%
we have here.

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:07.640 align:middle line:84%
So let's just consider
some general process.

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:13.000 align:middle line:84%
So you have a bunch of initial
states and some final states,

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:18.040 align:middle line:84%
But imagine one of the
initial state is a photon.

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:20.120 align:middle line:84%
It's the one we are
interested here,

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:25.130 align:middle line:84%
this polarization k alpha,
polarization k alpha.

00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:27.650 align:middle line:90%


00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And so now the
amplitude just become mu

00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:44.000 align:middle line:84%
and then this is the
same as the-- you

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.650 align:middle line:90%
have some final state.

00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
some initial state.

00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:56.240 align:middle line:84%
But within the initial state,
there's a k alpha state, OK.

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Then the k alpha state
corresponding to the photon.

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:03.800 align:middle line:90%


00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:08.770 align:middle line:84%
But now, remember, which we
discuss in your homework,

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:12.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's the purpose
to put it in your homework.

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:19.320 align:middle line:84%
The final state
for k alpha, which

00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:22.510 align:middle line:84%
defined by transverse
polarization,

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:35.730 align:middle line:84%
it's only a representative
in the equivalence class

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:36.230 align:middle line:90%
of states.

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:50.120 align:middle line:90%


00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And within this
equivalence class,

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:56.765 align:middle line:84%
they are related by these
called null states, OK.

00:51:56.765 --> 00:52:04.790 align:middle line:90%


00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:11.610 align:middle line:84%
So we can shift it
by our null state

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:12.985 align:middle line:84%
and the physics
will be the same.

00:52:12.985 --> 00:52:17.870 align:middle line:90%


00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:20.230 align:middle line:84%
So, now, remember
the last state--

00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:22.980 align:middle line:84%
it's like a gauge
transformation.

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:25.130 align:middle line:84%
So the last state
corresponding to--

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:29.150 align:middle line:84%
and this process corresponding
to you change your initial--

00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:35.470 align:middle line:84%
you change your polarization
to that corresponding

00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:37.510 align:middle line:90%
to a null state.

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And null state, the feature
is that it's polarization is

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:45.030 align:middle line:90%
proportional to the momentum.

00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:47.580 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's how we are--

00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:49.140 align:middle line:90%
remember, we showed that--

00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:51.800 align:middle line:84%
because this is a
gauge transformation.

00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:55.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is like a
gauge transformation.

00:52:55.660 --> 00:53:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And we also discussed the reason
this is a equivalence class

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:04.640 align:middle line:84%
because when you
shift by a null state,

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:09.650 align:middle line:84%
the overlap between the null
state to any state is 0, OK,

00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:10.910 align:middle line:90%
to any state is 0.

00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And so you can shift
by a null state.

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.200 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that
you can shift this

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:23.330 align:middle line:84%
by a null state, your
physics is the same.

00:53:23.330 --> 00:53:25.315 align:middle line:84%
So now you see this
equation 2 here.

00:53:25.315 --> 00:54:02.270 align:middle line:90%


00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:11.090 align:middle line:84%
So this implies that M
mu k mu must be zero.

00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:15.610 align:middle line:90%


00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:20.530 align:middle line:90%
k mu must be 0, OK.

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
important identity.

00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:31.330 align:middle line:84%
This is called the Ward
identity because this

00:54:31.330 --> 00:54:37.090 align:middle line:84%
is a very important
feature, which can simplify

00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:38.580 align:middle line:90%
your calculation a lot, OK.

00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:42.180 align:middle line:90%


00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:45.300 align:middle line:84%
So the M mu must
satisfy the feature

00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:48.090 align:middle line:84%
that when it contract
with k mu you get 0.

00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:50.750 align:middle line:90%


00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:59.730 align:middle line:84%
So now remember the k
mu, you just equal to--

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:05.955 align:middle line:84%
so this is on-shell
external state, or minus.

00:55:05.955 --> 00:55:09.160 align:middle line:90%


00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:13.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is the
on-shell external state.

00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:15.660 align:middle line:90%
And then this is just given by--

00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:19.650 align:middle line:84%
if I take a factor
k out and this is

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:21.870 align:middle line:90%
given by minus 1 and then k--

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:25.110 align:middle line:90%


00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:28.410 align:middle line:84%
and this is a fact I think
you also used in your pset--

00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:29.580 align:middle line:90%
and this is the--

00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:36.330 align:middle line:84%
and this thing is just
the same as the difference

00:55:36.330 --> 00:55:44.060 align:middle line:84%
between the zeroth polarization
vector and the third one

00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:46.340 align:middle line:90%
from what we wrote here.

00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:50.400 align:middle line:90%
I think I get the sign.

00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the sign does not
matter very much here.

00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:54.575 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just make sure.

00:55:54.575 --> 00:55:59.140 align:middle line:90%


00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, for my sign
this would be--

00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:03.523 align:middle line:90%
yeah, it's minus epsilon.

00:56:03.523 --> 00:56:04.315 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's right.

00:56:04.315 --> 00:56:07.440 align:middle line:90%


00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And then this equation just
implies that epsilon mu 0 M mu

00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:21.020 align:middle line:90%
is equal to epsilon mu 3 M mu.

00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:25.940 align:middle line:84%
So that tells you
that epsilon mu 0 M mu

00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:32.810 align:middle line:84%
squared is equal to
epsilon mu 3 M mu squared.

00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:34.835 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is the one
we wanted to prove.

00:56:34.835 --> 00:56:37.437 align:middle line:90%


00:56:37.437 --> 00:56:39.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is the one
we wanted to prove.

00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:42.650 align:middle line:90%


00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:44.680 align:middle line:90%
So this simplifies life a lot.

00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:47.980 align:middle line:90%


00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:52.520 align:middle line:84%
So now we show that we can
actually make this replacement

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:54.890 align:middle line:84%
because the 0 and
the 3 component

00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:57.520 align:middle line:84%
add together become
actually a null vector.

00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And that actually
does not contribute.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:08.300 align:middle line:84%
So now this amplitude we
have two external photons.

00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:10.310 align:middle line:90%
So we can write it as--

00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:12.680 align:middle line:90%
OK, so for simplicity--

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:22.160 align:middle line:84%
so for our amplitude,
so back to Compton case,

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.360 align:middle line:90%
to the Compton story.

00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And then the amplitude
then have the form--

00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:30.430 align:middle line:90%
so we have 2.

00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:36.270 align:middle line:84%
So I have epsilon mu, alpha 2,
star, and epsilon mu alpha 1.

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And then this will
multiply some T mu nu.

00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:42.110 align:middle line:90%
OK, so I call the rest T mu nu.

00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:42.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:47.080 align:middle line:90%


00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:59.870 align:middle line:84%
So now when I do the
spin sum, M squared,

00:57:59.870 --> 00:58:06.640 align:middle line:84%
then I can just use this
twice for each epsilon.

00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:07.750 align:middle line:90%
And then I just get--

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:11.620 align:middle line:90%


00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:15.070 align:middle line:90%
essentially I just get--

00:58:15.070 --> 00:58:17.830 align:middle line:90%
let me just write one more step.

00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:25.080 align:middle line:84%
I will get alpha 1,
alpha 2 equal to 1 and 2.

00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Then I have epsilon mu alpha 2
star, epsilon lambda alpha 2.

00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:38.060 align:middle line:90%


00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:45.280 align:middle line:84%
So epsilon nu, alpha 1,
epsilon rho, alpha one star.

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I have T mu
nu, T lambda rho star.

00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:54.580 align:middle line:90%
OK, just the square of this guy.

00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And now I can replace
this by eta mu lambda,

00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:00.100 align:middle line:90%
I can replace by eta mu rho.

00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:06.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, and then this just become
equal to eta mu, lambda, eta

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:14.411 align:middle line:84%
mu, rho, T mu, nu,
T lambda, rho, OK.

00:59:14.411 --> 00:59:27.120 align:middle line:90%


00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:32.420 align:middle line:84%
So this just makes
life much easier, OK.

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:36.440 align:middle line:90%
Makes life much easier.

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so essentially these
are the two important tricks

00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:44.570 align:middle line:84%
which one need to do in the
photon in this Compton case

00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:46.620 align:middle line:90%
compared with this story.

00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:48.620 align:middle line:90%
And once you have these--

00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and this part will be just
the spin sum for the fermions.

00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And then that we can
just use the same trick

00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:58.190 align:middle line:90%
as we did last time, OK.

00:59:58.190 --> 01:00:00.200 align:middle line:90%
So we will not repeat that, OK.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.320 align:middle line:84%
So now let me just write
down your final answer, OK.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And now we can just write
down the final answer.

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.540 align:middle line:84%
So before writing
down the final answer,

01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:11.460 align:middle line:90%
let me just define the frame.

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:13.250 align:middle line:84%
So for the Compton
scattering, it's

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:18.180 align:middle line:84%
often convenient to consider
the reat frame of the electron.

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:20.360 align:middle line:84%
So we consider photon
because there's

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.220 align:middle line:90%
no rest frame for photon, OK.

01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's often
convenient to consider

01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:26.560 align:middle line:90%
the rest frame of the electron.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.485 align:middle line:84%
So let's just
consider the picture.

01:00:28.485 --> 01:00:54.310 align:middle line:90%


01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:56.800 align:middle line:84%
When you consider the rest
frame of the electron, --

01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:01.350 align:middle line:90%


01:01:01.350 --> 01:01:11.050 align:middle line:84%
so this is often the way roughly
often also experiment is done.

01:01:11.050 --> 01:01:13.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you can essentially
consider the, say,

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:17.540 align:middle line:84%
electron in the matter, which
they don't have much velocity.

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And then you can have
a photon come in.

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:24.260 align:middle line:84%
So imagine you have
an electron here

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:25.690 align:middle line:90%
and you have a photon come in.

01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:28.990 align:middle line:90%


01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:31.100 align:middle line:90%
OK, you have a photon come in.

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:35.950 align:middle line:84%
So let's call this, the
incoming axis, to be the z-axis.

01:01:35.950 --> 01:01:40.650 align:middle line:84%
OK, and then after
scattering the photon,

01:01:40.650 --> 01:01:44.650 align:middle line:84%
say will be scattered
into this direction.

01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:46.290 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's call
this direction theta.

01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:49.750 align:middle line:90%


01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:50.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:53.270 align:middle line:90%


01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:56.270 align:middle line:90%
So in this setup--

01:01:56.270 --> 01:02:00.950 align:middle line:84%
so then the momentum
of the electron

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:06.200 align:middle line:84%
is just the m, 0, OK, just
the mass of the momentum.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.560 align:middle line:90%
Or I labeled the momentum.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And the momentum of the
photon, incoming photon, p2,

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:18.110 align:middle line:90%
would be just omega 0, 0, omega.

01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:20.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, so only have the
momentum in the z direction.

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:24.390 align:middle line:90%


01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Then the final momentum of
the electron is k mu, k1.

01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:30.660 align:middle line:90%
So this can be something--

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:32.760 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's not worry about it.

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:36.540 align:middle line:90%
Then for the photon--

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:39.430 align:middle line:84%
so photon momentum,
final photon momentum--

01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:43.300 align:middle line:84%
so let's call it--
yeah, so this is k2.

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:49.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, so k2 we can parameterize
it by omega prime.

01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And then omega prime then going
into the spatial direction,

01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:00.030 align:middle line:84%
the unit vector in the
spatial direction for k2--

01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:01.050 align:middle line:90%
let's call it n.

01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:04.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is the
direction of n,

01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:07.920 align:middle line:84%
which is the theta angle of
respect to the z direction, OK.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:10.910 align:middle line:90%


01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And then the k1
just can be obtained

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:16.730 align:middle line:84%
by momentum conservation
from these quantities, OK.

01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:19.720 align:middle line:90%


01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:26.440 align:middle line:84%
So k1 would be just
p1 plus p2 minus k2.

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:29.850 align:middle line:90%


01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:32.880 align:middle line:84%
So from the fact
that the electron

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:38.295 align:middle line:84%
have a static mass
minus m squared, OK.

01:03:38.295 --> 01:03:42.230 align:middle line:90%


01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:44.610 align:middle line:90%
And then this relation--

01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:49.670 align:middle line:84%
then the p1 plus p2 minus k2
should satisfy the constraint

01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:55.818 align:middle line:84%
that this should be equal
to minus m squared, OK.

01:03:55.818 --> 01:03:58.730 align:middle line:84%
It should satisfy
the constraint --

01:03:58.730 --> 01:04:03.590 align:middle line:84%
from this equation, you can
actually solve omega prime

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:05.210 align:middle line:90%
in terms of omega.

01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:08.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we will not write down
this equation explicitly.

01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:11.420 align:middle line:90%
You can easily check yourself.

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:13.160 align:middle line:90%
You can easily check yourself.

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:16.670 align:middle line:84%
So you find the omega
prime is equal to omega

01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:23.370 align:middle line:84%
divided by 1 plus omega m
and the 1 minus cosine theta.

01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:26.640 align:middle line:90%


01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:34.940 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is the final
frequency of the photon,

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:39.270 align:middle line:84%
expressed in terms of initial
frequency of the photon

01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:42.660 align:middle line:84%
and the mass of the
electron and then

01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:44.160 align:middle line:90%
this scattering angle, theta.

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:48.640 align:middle line:90%


01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:52.220 align:middle line:84%
So now let me just write
down the final answer,

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:53.720 align:middle line:90%
with this set up.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And then you find in the
rest frame of the electron,

01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:01.780 align:middle line:84%
the differential cross
section can be written.

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:06.970 align:middle line:84%
So again the phi direction
would be symmetric, OK.

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And so this only worry
about the theta direction.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:16.310 align:middle line:84%
So this can be written
as pi alpha square, so

01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:19.190 align:middle line:84%
alpha against the fine
structure constant divided

01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:25.930 align:middle line:84%
by m squared and then given by
omega prime, the final momentum

01:05:25.930 --> 01:05:29.650 align:middle line:84%
frequency for the
photon divided by omega

01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:35.260 align:middle line:84%
squared and omega prime divided
by omega and omega, omega

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:39.950 align:middle line:90%
prime minus sine squared.

01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:41.375 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this is the final answer.

01:05:41.375 --> 01:05:45.500 align:middle line:90%


01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:48.213 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is the final answer
for the Compton scattering

01:05:48.213 --> 01:05:49.130 align:middle line:90%
and the cross section.

01:05:49.130 --> 01:05:51.710 align:middle line:90%


01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:56.100 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this formula actually
contains a lot of physics,

01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:58.090 align:middle line:90%
contains a lot of physics.

01:05:58.090 --> 01:06:00.990 align:middle line:84%
So let me just describe
some of the physics here.

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:11.090 align:middle line:90%


01:06:11.090 --> 01:06:12.970 align:middle line:84%
So let's first
consider the regime

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:15.700 align:middle line:84%
that the photons
have very low energy.

01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:19.450 align:middle line:84%
OK, just low energy
photons, shining some light,

01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:20.590 align:middle line:90%
shining on the--

01:06:20.590 --> 01:06:23.410 align:middle line:90%


01:06:23.410 --> 01:06:27.100 align:middle line:84%
so suppose the photon
have very low frequency.

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:31.030 align:middle line:84%
They're much smaller
than the electron mass.

01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:34.100 align:middle line:84%
So now if you look
at this formula--

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:36.320 align:middle line:84%
so if the initial
photon is much,

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:39.370 align:middle line:84%
much smaller than the
mass and then this factor

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:44.080 align:middle line:84%
is approximately 0, then
you find in this regime

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:47.170 align:middle line:84%
that omega prime is
actually approximately

01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:51.520 align:middle line:90%
equal to the omega.

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:55.030 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you find in this
regime the frequency actually

01:06:55.030 --> 01:07:02.430 align:middle line:84%
does not change when the photon
scatter away from the electron,

01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:05.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And then now omega
prime equal to omega.

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:08.970 align:middle line:90%
So this factor becomes 1.

01:07:08.970 --> 01:07:11.550 align:middle line:84%
This factor become 1
and 1 minus sine theta

01:07:11.550 --> 01:07:13.020 align:middle line:90%
equal to cosine square theta.

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:14.700 align:middle line:90%
And this becomes one.

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And there you find
then d sigma, d

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:23.150 align:middle line:84%
cosine theta just
equal to pi alpha

01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:30.390 align:middle line:84%
squared divided by m squared
then plus 1 cosine squared

01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:32.520 align:middle line:90%
theta.

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:47.330 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is a famous
formula, more than 100 years ago

01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:50.060 align:middle line:90%
or even more.

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:54.110 align:middle line:90%
Because this is the classical--

01:07:54.110 --> 01:07:56.480 align:middle line:84%
so this is called the
Thompson cross-section.

01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:06.640 align:middle line:90%


01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, so these are
Thomson cross-section

01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:13.390 align:middle line:84%
derived from the
classical electrodynamics.

01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:16.779 align:middle line:84%
OK, and so this is a
result already known

01:08:16.779 --> 01:08:22.580 align:middle line:84%
in the 19th century from the
classical electrodynamics.

01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:25.580 align:middle line:84%
So how people
derived this formula

01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:29.550 align:middle line:84%
in the classical
electrodynamics--

01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:33.134 align:middle line:84%
so in classical electrodynamics,
you do it this way.

01:08:33.134 --> 01:09:01.020 align:middle line:90%


01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:03.020 align:middle line:84%
So in classical
electrodynamics--

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:08.029 align:middle line:90%


01:09:08.029 --> 01:09:13.149 align:middle line:84%
so light is believed to be a
wave, electromagnetic wave, OK.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:15.500 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, it's an
electromagnetic wave.

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:18.984 align:middle line:84%
So this electron, or
this electric field,

01:09:18.984 --> 01:09:23.660 align:middle line:84%
so with a polarization,
and then the magnitude.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:25.729 align:middle line:90%
And then it's a wave, OK.

01:09:25.729 --> 01:09:26.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a plane wave.

01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:31.529 align:middle line:90%


01:09:31.529 --> 01:09:32.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So from the classical
electrodynamics,

01:09:35.250 --> 01:09:37.170 align:middle line:90%
the light is just a wave, OK.

01:09:37.170 --> 01:09:39.540 align:middle line:84%
When you shine the
light on the material,

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:42.069 align:middle line:90%
the light will scatter.

01:09:42.069 --> 01:09:44.890 align:middle line:84%
Under the physical
description of the light

01:09:44.890 --> 01:09:46.420 align:middle line:90%
scatter is the following.

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:54.410 align:middle line:90%


01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is an oscillating
electric field.

01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:02.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a charged
particle like electron,

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:05.840 align:middle line:84%
then it will
oscillate because it

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:22.990 align:middle line:84%
has a charge under
such an E. So you

01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:25.030 align:middle line:84%
can approximate the
electron in the matter

01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:27.580 align:middle line:84%
just by a forced
harmonic oscillator.

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:31.070 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's the forced oscillation.

01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:32.711 align:middle line:90%
It's a forced oscillation.

01:10:32.711 --> 01:10:35.870 align:middle line:90%


01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:41.510 align:middle line:84%
So you should have
learned in 8.03

01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:47.150 align:middle line:84%
that under a forced
oscillation, essentially

01:10:47.150 --> 01:10:52.190 align:middle line:84%
the electron velocity electron
will have acceleration

01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:55.655 align:middle line:84%
essentially given by
the given by this.

01:10:55.655 --> 01:10:56.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let me just--

01:10:56.750 --> 01:11:02.290 align:middle line:84%
proportional through the
exponential i omega T plus i

01:11:02.290 --> 01:11:04.980 align:middle line:90%
kx.

01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:09.770 align:middle line:84%
OK, essentially just the force
acceleration were like this.

01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And then from classical
electrodynamics because this

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:14.390 align:middle line:90%
is accelerated motion.

01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:16.370 align:middle line:90%
This is accelerated charge.

01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And accelerated oscillators in
the classical electrodynamics

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:22.910 align:middle line:90%
will emit waves.

01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:26.400 align:middle line:84%
OK, we emit
electromagnetic wave.

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.170 align:middle line:90%
So this will radiate.

01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:33.575 align:middle line:84%
So this will lead to radiation
with frequency omega.

01:11:33.575 --> 01:11:39.320 align:middle line:90%


01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:43.820 align:middle line:84%
So essentially controlled
by this acceleration, OK.

01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
classical result in

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:48.260 align:middle line:84%
the classical electrodynamics
that such a oscillator

01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:51.810 align:middle line:84%
will emit the light
with frequency omega.

01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:54.950 align:middle line:84%
So that's the scattering
process from the classical point

01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:56.630 align:middle line:90%
of view.

01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:57.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:11:57.530 --> 01:11:59.750 align:middle line:84%
From a classical point of
view, drive the oscillator,

01:11:59.750 --> 01:12:01.880 align:middle line:90%
the oscillator will emit, OK.

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you go from this
process, then you precisely

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.130 align:middle line:90%
find this formula, OK.

01:12:09.130 --> 01:12:11.650 align:middle line:84%
You precisely find
this formula, OK.

01:12:11.650 --> 01:12:14.220 align:middle line:90%


01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:15.540 align:middle line:90%
So in this case--

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:21.980 align:middle line:90%


01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:39.400 align:middle line:84%
so regarding this,
the value of omega,

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:43.450 align:middle line:84%
the omega prime, the
emitted photon always--

01:12:43.450 --> 01:12:45.370 align:middle line:84%
so in this story,
omega prime always

01:12:45.370 --> 01:12:49.450 align:middle line:84%
equal to omega, OK, because
it's a driven oscillation, OK.

01:12:49.450 --> 01:12:57.470 align:middle line:90%


01:12:57.470 --> 01:13:00.360 align:middle line:84%
So classically, you
always have this.

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:04.890 align:middle line:84%
So you always have
elastic scattering.

01:13:04.890 --> 01:13:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So the photon frequency
does not change.

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:09.860 align:middle line:90%


01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:13.800 align:middle line:90%
And then the equation--

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:20.540 align:middle line:84%
so let me call this equation
1 and the equation 1 holds.

01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:24.980 align:middle line:84%
OK, yeah, and then
equal this a and b.

01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:26.550 align:middle line:90%
And equation 1 holds.

01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So the classical,
very robust prediction

01:13:31.690 --> 01:13:34.780 align:middle line:84%
is that you always have
elastic scattering when you

01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:38.020 align:middle line:90%
shine light on this Compton.

01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And then the equation, you have
this Thomson cross-section.

01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:46.660 align:middle line:84%
But then now in the early
part of the 20th century,

01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:50.030 align:middle line:84%
when Compton did
this experiment--

01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:51.770 align:middle line:90%
and then he said--

01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:56.600 align:middle line:84%
then he observed actually the
frequency can be smaller, OK.

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:59.090 align:middle line:84%
So in this formula,
generically omega prime

01:13:59.090 --> 01:14:01.700 align:middle line:90%
is smaller than omega.

01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:03.290 align:middle line:90%
OK, but in quantum mechanics--

01:14:03.290 --> 01:14:09.040 align:middle line:90%


01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:14.530 align:middle line:84%
But in quantum mechanics, we see
that omega prime is generically

01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:19.900 align:middle line:84%
smaller than omega big because
this is 1 plus a factor, which

01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:22.325 align:middle line:90%
is greater than 1, OK.

01:14:22.325 --> 01:14:25.200 align:middle line:90%


01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And in particular,
this deviation

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.500 align:middle line:84%
will become more
obvious when omega

01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:35.130 align:middle line:84%
become comparable to m when
omega become comparable to m.

01:14:35.130 --> 01:14:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this is the
quantum mechanics.

01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So you will always have
inelastic scattering.

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:48.300 align:middle line:90%


01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:56.420 align:middle line:84%
So this makes sense because
just for momentum conservation

01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:58.760 align:middle line:90%
in actual--

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:02.240 align:middle line:84%
if some photon hit the electron,
electron needs to move.

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:03.920 align:middle line:90%
The electron need to move.

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Then, of course, the
energy will increase.

01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:08.113 align:middle line:84%
And then the energy
will increase,

01:15:08.113 --> 01:15:09.530 align:middle line:84%
in the omega prime
of course, have

01:15:09.530 --> 01:15:11.480 align:middle line:90%
to be smaller than omega, OK.

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:17.190 align:middle line:84%
So in the rest frame, an
electron always gain energy.

01:15:17.190 --> 01:15:19.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's why in
quantum mechanics

01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:23.680 align:middle line:90%
always inelastic scattering, OK.

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And then the star under this
equation 1 no longer holds OK.

01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:36.470 align:middle line:90%


01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:40.190 align:middle line:90%
So in the early days--

01:15:40.190 --> 01:15:45.860 align:middle line:84%
so in the early days, this
just cannot be explained using

01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:47.220 align:middle line:90%
classical electrodynamics.

01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:54.490 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is decisive
evidence that actually photon--

01:15:54.490 --> 01:15:58.600 align:middle line:84%
the light behaves very
different quantum mechanically

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:01.510 align:middle line:90%
from classical wave, OK.

01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:05.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this simple fact
can be just explained

01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:08.050 align:middle line:84%
by treating a photon
as a particle.

01:16:08.050 --> 01:16:09.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is the
decisive support

01:16:09.910 --> 01:16:12.220 align:middle line:84%
that the photon actually
behave like a particle,

01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:13.885 align:middle line:90%
OK, behave like a particle.

01:16:13.885 --> 01:16:17.110 align:middle line:90%


01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:20.930 align:middle line:84%
So leads to the particle
picture of photon, OK.

01:16:20.930 --> 01:16:33.360 align:middle line:90%


01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:37.660 align:middle line:90%
OK, so we are out of time soon.

01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So let me just mention one
simple application of this.

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:49.040 align:middle line:90%


01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:54.430 align:middle line:84%
So in particular, let me just
mention two small things.

01:16:54.430 --> 01:17:00.250 align:middle line:84%
So one thing is that if omega
is much, much greater than m,

01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:04.600 align:middle line:84%
then omega prime divided
by n becomes very small.

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:13.480 align:middle line:90%


01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:23.000 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this actually becomes
much, much smaller than 1,

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.310 align:middle line:84%
except for theta
equal to zero, OK.

01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:33.060 align:middle line:90%


01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:37.200 align:middle line:84%
So if the initial photon
momentum energy is very big,

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:41.220 align:middle line:84%
then actually most of the energy
will go to the electron, OK.

01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And then the final
frequency is actually

01:17:42.990 --> 01:17:46.480 align:middle line:84%
become much, much smaller
than initial frequency.

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:48.760 align:middle line:90%
This is one remark.

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And another remark-- so this
is in the electron rest frame.

01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:02.380 align:middle line:84%
But in a different
frame, you will actually

01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:04.610 align:middle line:90%
get a very different answer.

01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:08.590 align:middle line:84%
So now let's imagine
we have a frame--

01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:12.080 align:middle line:84%
So in this frame the
electron just sits here.

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:15.170 align:middle line:84%
The photon comes
in the z direction.

01:18:15.170 --> 01:18:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine we boost the system
in the negative z direction,

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.560 align:middle line:90%
the negative z direction.

01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:24.160 align:middle line:84%
So the result of this boost
is that the photon energy

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:25.810 align:middle line:90%
becomes very small.

01:18:25.810 --> 01:18:27.670 align:middle line:84%
And the electron
energy will become

01:18:27.670 --> 01:18:29.620 align:middle line:84%
bigger and bigger when
you increase the boost,

01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:32.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, because the boost is
opposite to the direction

01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:35.830 align:middle line:84%
of the photon so
that you boost more.

01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:38.440 align:middle line:84%
The photon energy will become
smaller and smaller, OK.

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So now imagine you
go to a frame, which

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:45.410 align:middle line:84%
photons have a very small
energy compared to electron.

01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:46.880 align:middle line:90%
And then this is a very--

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:50.165 align:middle line:84%
then in that frame will be
a very fast electron heat

01:18:50.165 --> 01:18:52.550 align:middle line:90%
of a very low energy photon.

01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:55.640 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is called the
inverse Compton scattering.

01:18:55.640 --> 01:19:07.530 align:middle line:90%


01:19:07.530 --> 01:19:12.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, so in this case,
then the energy

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:15.560 align:middle line:84%
in-- then the energy in the--
initial energy in the electron

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:19.490 align:middle line:84%
then can be transferred
into the photon.

01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you have a very fast,
very high energy electron

01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:24.830 align:middle line:90%
hit a a low energy photon.

01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Then you just give a
big kick to the photon.

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And the photon can
have very high energy.

01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:32.220 align:middle line:90%
So this is a very simple effect.

01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:39.990 align:middle line:84%
But it can have very important
astrophysical applications.

01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:42.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is called the important
application in this called

01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:45.630 align:middle line:90%
the Sunyaev--Zeldovich effect.

01:19:45.630 --> 01:19:54.540 align:middle line:90%


01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:59.960 align:middle line:84%
So essentially they have the
simple observation like this.

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.985 align:middle line:84%
So in the universe,
we have the--

01:20:01.985 --> 01:20:04.970 align:middle line:90%


01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:08.120 align:middle line:84%
we have microwave
background radiation.

01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:10.448 align:middle line:84%
OK, the microwave background
radiation, the photon

01:20:10.448 --> 01:20:12.740 align:middle line:84%
is very low energy because
the temperature is very low.

01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:17.700 align:middle line:90%


01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:20.100 align:middle line:90%
But around a galaxy--

01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:23.160 align:middle line:84%
so if you're near
the galaxy center,

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.440 align:middle line:90%
so near the galaxy cluster--

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.870 align:middle line:84%
and the galaxy cluster,
some of the electrons,

01:20:27.870 --> 01:20:29.830 align:middle line:90%
they can have very high energy.

01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And when they scatter and
the microwave background

01:20:33.710 --> 01:20:37.310 align:middle line:84%
photon and then they can
give those microwave photon

01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:41.240 align:middle line:90%
a big kick, and then they will--

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:44.220 align:middle line:84%
then the photon will
get a very high energy.

01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So then by looking at the
photon spectrum in the sky,

01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:50.810 align:middle line:90%
look for this kind of hotspot.

01:20:50.810 --> 01:20:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And then this is a way to
detect the galaxy cluster.

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:58.730 align:middle line:84%
OK, then you can just use this
inverse Compton scattering

01:20:58.730 --> 01:21:03.830 align:middle line:84%
that detects the location
of the galaxy cluster.

01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:07.220 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very cool--

01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:10.210 align:middle line:90%
it's a very cool application.

01:21:10.210 --> 01:21:12.000 align:middle line:90%
