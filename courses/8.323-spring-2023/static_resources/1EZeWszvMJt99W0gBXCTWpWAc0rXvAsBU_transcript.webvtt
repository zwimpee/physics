00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.570 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Good.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:18.220 align:middle line:84%
So last lecture, we
discussed Noether's theorem.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.510 align:middle line:84%
For every symmetry, for
every continuous symmetry,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.540 align:middle line:90%
there's a conserved current.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And then we also started talking
about relativistic quantum

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.780 align:middle line:90%
mechanics.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.370 align:middle line:84%
How we want to unify
special relativity

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.990 align:middle line:90%
in quantum mechanics.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.840 align:middle line:84%
So the most immediate
idea for that

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.770 align:middle line:84%
is what's called the
relativistic quantum mechanics.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And the most immediate
generalization

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.560 align:middle line:90%
of the Schrodinger equation--

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.480 align:middle line:90%
so if you have--

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.110 align:middle line:90%


00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.950 align:middle line:84%
so at the end of
last lecture, we

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.950 align:middle line:84%
talked about, say, the most
immediate generalization

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.010 align:middle line:84%
of the Schrodinger
equation, which--

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.830 align:middle line:84%
so if I have E equal to,
say, p squared divided by 2m,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.410 align:middle line:84%
and then you go to
non-relativistic quantum

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.985 align:middle line:90%
mechanics Schrodinger equation.

00:01:17.985 --> 00:01:22.070 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And now if you have
E squared equal to p

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.240 align:middle line:84%
squared plus m squared
for relativistic particle,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.790 align:middle line:84%
and then you get what's called
the Klein-Gordon equation.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.610 align:middle line:90%


00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And again, this side
has the implication

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.580 align:middle line:90%
of the wave function.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.620 align:middle line:84%
So this describe--
and then this--

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.100 align:middle line:84%
so as a generalization
of this, then

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.395 align:middle line:84%
this means to
describe the quantum

00:01:53.395 --> 00:01:59.250 align:middle line:84%
mechanics of relativistic
free particle, say, of mass m,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.470 align:middle line:90%
of mass m.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So here, the psi pi t,
x is the wave function

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.249 align:middle line:90%
of a relativistic particle.

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:17.150 align:middle line:90%


00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.550 align:middle line:90%
Relativistic particle of mass m.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:30.240 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And we also notice that
this equation actually

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.560 align:middle line:84%
is the same as the simplest
field theory equation.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.320 align:middle line:84%
So we also talked about a
simplest scalar field theory.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.980 align:middle line:90%
Classical.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.460 align:middle line:90%
So here is a simple--

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.505 align:middle line:84%
a classic simplest
scalar field theory.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:56.640 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.385 align:middle line:84%
So this theory you can write
down the action of the form.

00:03:02.385 --> 00:03:09.850 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So this is the simplest
theory you can write down.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And then relativistic
environment theory.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And then the equation
of motion of this--

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.250 align:middle line:84%
so this is-- you view
this as a classical field.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And again, this has
the equation of motion

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.550 align:middle line:84%
have exactly the same
form as this equation.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.590 align:middle line:84%
But now, here, phi, again,
is a function of t, x.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Now has a completely different
physical interpretation.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.895 align:middle line:84%
So here is-- this is
a classical field.

00:03:41.895 --> 00:03:44.440 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.140 align:middle line:90%
So this is a classical field.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.880 align:middle line:84%
So in this case,
the interpretation

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
of the x in here, and in
here, it's very different.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.030 align:middle line:84%
So not only phi and the psi,
the physical interpretation

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.045 align:middle line:90%
are different.

00:04:01.045 --> 00:04:03.420 align:middle line:84%
The physical interpretation
of x also here are different.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.400 align:middle line:90%
Here, x is just a label.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Is a label for the
location in the space which

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.070 align:middle line:90%
we define this field.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.820 align:middle line:84%
But here, the x
is the eigenvalue

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.640 align:middle line:84%
of the position operator for
this relativistic particle.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And so they have very different
physical interpretation.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And so let me just
label this equation by 1

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.290 align:middle line:84%
and label this by 2
and this by 2 prime.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.470 align:middle line:90%


00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.490 align:middle line:84%
So we also mentioned
that this one has--

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.070 align:middle line:84%
the interpretation of
this as the wave function

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.230 align:middle line:90%
for relativistic-- yeah, for--

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.660 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so the equation for
relativistic quantum mechanics

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.160 align:middle line:90%
has a number of difficulties.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:58.040 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:06.040 align:middle line:84%
So the first is that, as you
will show in your pset 2,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.170 align:middle line:90%
there's no sensible--

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:23.840 align:middle line:84%
no sensible way to define a
positive definite probability

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.370 align:middle line:90%
density.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to interpret
this as a wave equation,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.492 align:middle line:90%
then you must have a wave--

00:05:34.492 --> 00:05:36.200 align:middle line:84%
then you must have a
probability density,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.390 align:middle line:84%
because in quantum
mechanics, probability

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.560 align:middle line:90%
should be conserved.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And the second difficulty is
that there's a negative energy

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.570 align:middle line:90%
state because of the square.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
take the square root,

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.370 align:middle line:84%
then you get the minus sign, and
then there's a negative energy

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:01.540 align:middle line:84%
state, which you cannot avoid
in quantum mechanics even though

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.260 align:middle line:84%
classically you can just
throw them away by hand.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing we
mentioned at the end,

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.670 align:middle line:84%
we said for a relativistic
wave equation,

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:23.660 align:middle line:84%
you can describe a fixed
number of particles.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:29.320 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.050 align:middle line:84%
So the particle
number cannot change.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.930 align:middle line:84%
So this equation describe
a single particle.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to
describe two particles,

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.110 align:middle line:84%
then you need to write
down a separate equation

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.000 align:middle line:90%
for a different wave function.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.240 align:middle line:84%
So this is for the
two-particle wave function will

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.760 align:middle line:90%
be like this and et cetera.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.480 align:middle line:84%
But this does not
really make sense

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.480 align:middle line:84%
in the relativistic
system because we

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.710 align:middle line:84%
know that in the relativistic
system, E equal to mc square,

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.730 align:middle line:84%
in any case, you
have enough energy,

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.150 align:middle line:84%
then you should be able
to create particles.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And then that means the number
of particles in the given

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.890 align:middle line:90%
process is not conserved.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.670 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to use your
quantum mechanics to describe

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.950 align:middle line:90%
a process, and then that--

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.220 align:middle line:84%
you cannot have a formalism,
which the number of particles

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.070 align:middle line:84%
is fixed, which
you cannot change.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And so this is actually the
most fundamental difficulty,

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.890 align:middle line:84%
is that you cannot change
the number of particles.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And related to this difficulty
is this interpretation.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Here, we say-- now
if you want to--

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.980 align:middle line:84%
we're saying here, there's
a fundamental asymmetry

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.990 align:middle line:90%
between the t and x.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.820 align:middle line:84%
Also, yeah, maybe
let me put it as 4,

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.340 align:middle line:90%
there's also fundamental--

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.040 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.890 align:middle line:84%
an additional
difficulty, there's

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:08.055 align:middle line:84%
a fundamental asymmetry
between t and x.

00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:11.780 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.930 align:middle line:84%
So here, in the wave
equation, t is just

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:20.010 align:middle line:84%
a parameter, which will be
describing the evolution,

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:28.110 align:middle line:84%
but the x is the eigenvalue
of quantum operators--

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.750 align:middle line:84%
eigenvalues of
quantum operators.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Say, corresponding to, say, hat.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.030 align:middle line:84%
By putting a hat, we denote
the corresponding a quantum

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:37.530 align:middle line:90%
operator.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this is the eigenvalue
of position operators.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And this asymmetry become
even more pronounced, say,

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.630 align:middle line:84%
if you can see
the two particles.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.055 align:middle line:84%
You have two x's here,
but the only one t.

00:08:48.055 --> 00:08:48.555 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:48.555 --> 00:08:52.270 align:middle line:90%


00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:56.650 align:middle line:84%
So those-- because of those
fundamental difficulties--

00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:05.580 align:middle line:84%
so if you connect this
i to iv, so we conclude

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:13.630 align:middle line:84%
that the relativistic quantum
mechanics defined in the sense

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.640 align:middle line:84%
that you write down
a wave equation,

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and for wave
function, don't even--

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.736 align:middle line:90%
it does not-- that's not--

00:09:23.736 --> 00:09:31.338 align:middle line:84%
cannot be the
fundamental description.

00:09:31.338 --> 00:09:33.130 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, but relativistic
quantum mechanic

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.880 align:middle line:84%
just refers to this
kind of wave equation.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:43.930 align:middle line:90%


00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:84%
So at most, this can be
approximated approximation

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.050 align:middle line:90%
at most.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.980 align:middle line:90%


00:09:54.980 --> 00:10:08.510 align:middle line:84%
This is approximate
description in situations, say,

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:16.280 align:middle line:84%
there's no particle
creation or annihilation.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:22.360 align:middle line:90%


00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So in case which your
particle number is fixed,

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:84%
and then you can use
this as approximation,

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.740 align:middle line:84%
but it cannot be a
fundamental description.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.860 align:middle line:84%
For example, later we will talk
about the fermionic version

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.130 align:middle line:90%
of this wave equation.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.970 align:middle line:84%
So this will describe a
particle without spin.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.300 align:middle line:84%
So later we will describe
the analogous equation

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.260 align:middle line:84%
for electrons for spin
half, and then that

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.010 align:middle line:84%
can indeed be used to describe
the electron in a hydrogen atom

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:57.220 align:middle line:84%
as far as you don't create
new electrons, et cetera.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so relativistic
quantum mechanics

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.590 align:middle line:84%
can only be described
as some kind of--

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.170 align:middle line:84%
considered as an
approximate description.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:11.830 align:middle line:84%
But now if you want to unify
special relativity and quantum

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.560 align:middle line:84%
mechanics together, it turns
out that the right formulation

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.390 align:middle line:90%
is just quantum field theory.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:24.750 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out that
the quantum field theory

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.420 align:middle line:90%
addresses these difficulties.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:37.130 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:38.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:43.600 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out
that the right way--

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.560 align:middle line:84%
so if we want to describe
quantum mechanics,

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.950 align:middle line:84%
say, of relativistic
particles of mass m--

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:55.080 align:middle line:84%
so we want to do here, it turns
out, the proper thing to do,

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.500 align:middle line:84%
which is a little bit
unintuitive at first sight,

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.400 align:middle line:84%
is to start with this field
theory, which seemingly have

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.260 align:middle line:84%
nothing to do with
relativistic particles,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.900 align:middle line:84%
but to start with this
classical field theory

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.420 align:middle line:90%
and then quantize it.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:12.800 align:middle line:84%
It turns out, once you treat
this theory as a quantum field

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.560 align:middle line:84%
theory, and this
becomes a theory

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.380 align:middle line:84%
of arbitrary number of
relativistic particles

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.390 align:middle line:90%
of mass m.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
non-intuitive part,

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:27.410 align:middle line:84%
and that's one of the miracle,
say, of the field theory,

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:31.820 align:middle line:84%
is that automatically gives
you a formalism for treating

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:35.090 align:middle line:90%
arbitrary number of particles.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:36.965 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:41.100 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.350 align:middle line:90%
And also, in field theory--

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:47.550 align:middle line:84%
so both t and x are
parameters even though x only

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:51.070 align:middle line:90%
labels your location.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.700 align:middle line:84%
So both t and x are
parameters, and so you

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.760 align:middle line:84%
can easily to make them
to be on equal ground

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.778 align:middle line:84%
to be compatible with
special relativity.

00:12:59.778 --> 00:13:01.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.925 align:middle line:90%
So any questions on this?

00:13:04.925 --> 00:13:09.360 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:09.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.020 align:middle line:84%
So we will see that the right
framework is quantum field

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:13.520 align:middle line:90%
theory.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:19.640 align:middle line:84%
So finally, as a last motivation
for quantum field theory,

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.210 align:middle line:90%
we quickly describe the last--

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:33.020 align:middle line:84%
so the field theory can
also arise at the limit

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:90%
of discrete systems.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:44.410 align:middle line:90%


00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:49.613 align:middle line:84%
And this is the most relevant
for condensed matter physics.

00:13:49.613 --> 00:13:50.155 align:middle line:90%
For example--

00:13:50.155 --> 00:13:53.360 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So let's just
consider, say, some--

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.290 align:middle line:84%
yeah, let's consider
8.03 example.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So let's imagine you have
this number of particles,

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:09.650 align:middle line:84%
a number of the atoms,
say, on the chain.

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And then they're connected
by some springs between them.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.960 align:middle line:90%


00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.750 align:middle line:90%
So this is the--

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.330 align:middle line:84%
yeah, consider this
to be infinite.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And the spacing between
them, say, is a.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:29.910 align:middle line:84%
So atom, I fixed on
some lattice points.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.930 align:middle line:90%
And the lattice spacing is a.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:38.080 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, so we can label the--

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.470 align:middle line:84%
say, each particle
by their position.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:45.220 align:middle line:84%
For example, this is x0, this
is x1, this is x2, et cetera.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:45.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And and the typical
particle is xn.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:54.470 align:middle line:84%
At the location of a
n-th particle is xn.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And so we can also
introduce the deviation

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.950 align:middle line:84%
between the equilibrium
position of each particle.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:04.250 align:middle line:90%
So let's call it eta n.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.440 align:middle line:84%
So now let's
consider the dynamics

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.420 align:middle line:90%
of eta n for this theory.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And so this is just a
deviation of the n-th particle

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.720 align:middle line:90%
from its equilibrium position.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.620 align:middle line:84%
So eta n 0 is
equilibrium position.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:21.150 align:middle line:84%
So now so now if you write down
the Lagrangian for this system,

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.630 align:middle line:84%
so we can easily do, you
just write T minus V.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:29.550 align:middle line:84%
So T is the kinetic energy
and V is the potential energy.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So we can just write it as
sum over n over all particles.

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And then let's assume
they have the same mass,

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.590 align:middle line:90%
let's write mu eta n dot square.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:84%
So this is a kinetic
term, so the mu

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.760 align:middle line:90%
is the mass for each particle.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And then their potential-- yeah,
let's assume at each point,

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.400 align:middle line:90%
there is also--

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.156 align:middle line:84%
yeah, let's just--
yeah, then there's

00:15:55.156 --> 00:15:58.310 align:middle line:84%
a interaction because each
particle are connected

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:03.020 align:middle line:84%
by the spring, and so
they are a harmonic force

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:08.260 align:middle line:90%
between neighboring particles.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And now let's
imagine also there's

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:15.400 align:middle line:84%
a harmonic potential which
trap this particle itself

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.950 align:middle line:90%
at each location.

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very simple spring
and the particle problem which

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.900 align:middle line:90%
you encounter, say, in 8.03.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.900 align:middle line:90%
Is this problem clear?

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:29.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.460 align:middle line:84%
I assume most of you have
seen this problem before.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And your task in
8.03 is actually

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:42.400 align:middle line:84%
to find the local modes,
say, of this system.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And in 8.03, you also
described that we can--

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.320 align:middle line:90%
and a go to zero limit.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.530 align:middle line:84%
So if the lattice
spacing is very small.

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And if we are only
interested in the behavior

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.410 align:middle line:84%
of the system at a
very large distance,

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.870 align:middle line:84%
say the distance is much
larger than a equals to--

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:02.020 align:middle line:84%
much larger than a, then you can
essentially treat this system

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:02.950 align:middle line:90%
as a continuum.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:05.690 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to resolve
individual particles.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.150 align:middle line:90%
And so we can just--

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.740 align:middle line:90%
equal to newer limit.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:17.970 align:middle line:84%
So it can be true to the chain
as a continuum of particles.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:28.030 align:middle line:90%


00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And so each eta n t, you
replace it by eta x, t.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:40.090 align:middle line:90%
So x label is position.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:43.420 align:middle line:84%
So x label is position,
t describe the dynamics.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.500 align:middle line:84%
So eta is the deviation
at the location x,

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.090 align:middle line:90%
and it's depend on t.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:51.280 align:middle line:90%
So this is the oscillator.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And then sum over n
in the Lagrangian,

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:02.480 align:middle line:84%
then we can replace it
by integral over dx.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And now you just treat this as
a one-dimensional continuum.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.930 align:middle line:90%
So integration over dx.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.430 align:middle line:84%
But of course, here, there's
a label-- a lattice spacing,

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:18.740 align:middle line:84%
so the so the infinitesimal
here, the element is a.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:23.560 align:middle line:84%
The a times the sum over n,
you can replace it by dx.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.250 align:middle line:90%


00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:28.530 align:middle line:90%
That is the lattice spacing.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And now you can just
write this Lagrangian

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.160 align:middle line:90%
in terms of continuum theory.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Now you can write
this Lagrangian

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:84%
in terms of continuum theory,
and then let's just do it.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.540 align:middle line:84%
So we can write it-- yeah, let
me just write one more step.

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.720 align:middle line:84%
So you can write
it as sum over a.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.930 align:middle line:84%
We take the a factor out
because the a factor out has

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.900 align:middle line:90%
to be changing to integration.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you have 1/2
mu divided by a eta n

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:01.410 align:middle line:90%
squared minus 1/2 lambda a.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:06.930 align:middle line:90%


00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:14.910 align:middle line:84%
So I just slightly
rewrite this Lagrangian

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:18.180 align:middle line:84%
so that it's easy to
take the continuum limit.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:23.780 align:middle line:84%
So we have taken the factor
of a out, but for this term,

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.210 align:middle line:84%
because this concerns the
difference between the two,

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:29.240 align:middle line:84%
and we also divided by
a in the downstairs,

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.340 align:middle line:84%
and then we need to
multiply a upstairs,

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:90%
and then there's a in the front.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.143 align:middle line:84%
And now the continuum
limit, you can just

00:19:37.143 --> 00:19:38.310 align:middle line:90%
replace this by an integral.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:41.880 align:middle line:90%
And now I just--

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.890 align:middle line:90%


00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:50.230 align:middle line:84%
can just write it as 1/2
mu tilde eta dot squared.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:55.680 align:middle line:84%
So now eta n just
replaced by eta x, t.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And here, let me
call it lambda tilde.

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.150 align:middle line:90%
Partial x eta square.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And this term, you
can just replace it

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.600 align:middle line:90%
by the derivative of eta.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And then this has just become
1/2 sigma tilde eta square.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:90%


00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And the mu tilde, of
course, is mu divided by a.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:21.500 align:middle line:90%
Lambda tilde is lambda times a.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And sigma tilde, this
is sigma divided by a.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:32.920 align:middle line:84%
So the continuum limit is that
this quantity has to be fixed.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.940 align:middle line:84%
The tilde, the quantity
has to be fixed.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And then we have a
continuum Lagrangian.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And then we have a
classical field theory.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And this theory is essentially
the same as that theory.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:52.230 align:middle line:84%
So if you take this
factor mu tilde out,

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:56.560 align:middle line:84%
if we take this
vector mu tilde out--

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.370 align:middle line:84%
so let me just take
this factor of mu

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:02.210 align:middle line:84%
tilde out in the front,
just up to a wall factor.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And here is lambda tilde
divided by mu tilde.

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.700 align:middle line:84%
We call it-- let's
call it v square.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And this becomes sigma
tilde divided by mu tilde,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.030 align:middle line:90%
let's call it m squared.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:20.510 align:middle line:84%
So the V squared is equal to
mu tilde is equal to the lambda

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:27.530 align:middle line:84%
tilde divided by mu tilde, and
m squared is equal to sigma

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:29.180 align:middle line:90%
tilde squared by mu tilde.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.960 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And then this is
just essentially

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:39.790 align:middle line:84%
identical to that theory
when V equal to 1.

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:47.900 align:middle line:84%
So when V equal to 1,
become the same, is just 2,

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.833 align:middle line:90%
the equation 2.

00:21:49.833 --> 00:21:51.500 align:middle line:84%
So we could do, of
course, corresponding

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.810 align:middle line:84%
to relativistic
case, speed of light,

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:57.560 align:middle line:84%
but in general, this
describe-- can-- yeah.

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:02.000 align:middle line:84%
This can describe--
but in general, this

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.610 align:middle line:84%
is a non-relativistic--
in general,

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:05.360 align:middle line:84%
this can be just a
long relativistic field

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.620 align:middle line:90%
theory for other values of V.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:15.770 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- so even though
this example is very simple,

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:21.170 align:middle line:84%
but this is actually a very
general way that we can treat

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:25.370 align:middle line:84%
many condensed matter systems,
which often involve a lattice,

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:28.910 align:middle line:84%
say, because the solid, you
can imagine all the atoms are

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:30.390 align:middle line:90%
on the lattice, et cetera.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you're only interested in
the very macroscopic behavior,

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:39.260 align:middle line:84%
then you can treat
solid as a continuum.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And now you can now if you're
interested in the mechanics

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:45.650 align:middle line:84%
of such a system, then the
quantum field theory then

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:46.670 align:middle line:90%
naturally arises.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:47.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:50.580 align:middle line:90%


00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:51.080 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.915 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this example?

00:22:52.915 --> 00:22:56.620 align:middle line:90%


00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:57.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:01.960 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So that, it goes
to 1 is the same as lambda

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.680 align:middle line:90%
and mu being comparable?

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.513 align:middle line:84%
So what does that, I
guess, physically mean?

00:23:06.513 --> 00:23:07.180 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.350 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: So the limit--

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:09.785 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:09.785 --> 00:23:12.155 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Like, the same
lambda as the same as mu?

00:23:12.155 --> 00:23:13.030 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.738 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So what is
that physically mean?

00:23:14.738 --> 00:23:16.145 align:middle line:90%
Like, the strength of--

00:23:16.145 --> 00:23:17.020 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:22.090 align:middle line:84%
This goes right into
the case that the--

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.180 align:middle line:84%
yeah, it just tells you that the
relativistic limit is special.

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.200 align:middle line:90%
Happens at very special point.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.847 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: But I guess, why
is that the relativistic--

00:23:29.847 --> 00:23:31.930 align:middle line:84%
To me, lambda is like the
strength of your spring,

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:32.380 align:middle line:90%
and then--

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:32.830 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:33.872 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: --use your mass.

00:23:33.872 --> 00:23:34.660 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Right.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.000 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Without that being
comparable, how does that--

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.300 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.038 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Because it's
not the same thing

00:23:38.038 --> 00:23:38.530 align:middle line:90%
as the relativistic--

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:38.740 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.660 align:middle line:84%
There's not much you
can read from here.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.280 align:middle line:84%
It's just like when you choose
some special parameters,

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:50.730 align:middle line:84%
then you can have a
relativistic limit, yeah.

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:51.470 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:52.322 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:23:52.322 --> 00:23:53.780 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Yeah, so
you said that you

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.072 align:middle line:84%
could use this to treat some
condensed matter problems?

00:23:56.072 --> 00:23:56.700 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.980 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Yeah, so these
are all scalars, right?

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.660 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: You can also have--

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.800 align:middle line:90%
you can also-- you mean--

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.170 align:middle line:84%
you can also have
tensors or vectors, yeah.

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:07.670 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: OK.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:08.810 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:11.495 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So like what
would you treat with this?

00:24:11.495 --> 00:24:12.242 align:middle line:90%
Like phonons.

00:24:12.242 --> 00:24:13.700 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Oh, you
can treat-- yeah.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.410 align:middle line:84%
For example, you
can treat phonons.

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:19.170 align:middle line:84%
You can also treat spins
and say, for example,

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:22.940 align:middle line:84%
if you have an Ising model, just
consider the lattice of spins,

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and then the average
spin, and then you

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:27.217 align:middle line:84%
can treat it as a
scalar field, and then

00:24:27.217 --> 00:24:29.008 align:middle line:84%
again, you can write
down the field theory.

00:24:29.008 --> 00:24:29.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the breakthrough
of the phase transition

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:38.660 align:middle line:84%
in condensed matter
physics to understand

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.550 align:middle line:84%
what phase transition
is really about

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:43.190 align:middle line:84%
and describe the behavior
of the phase transition,

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:46.850 align:middle line:84%
and precisely coincided with
the development of field theory.

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, actually,
increased our understanding

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:51.420 align:middle line:90%
of quantum field theory, yeah.

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:54.270 align:middle line:90%


00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:55.500 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.340 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.880 align:middle line:90%


00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.430 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Just to summarize what
we have discussed so far,

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:16.300 align:middle line:90%
all paths leads to QFT.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:19.990 align:middle line:84%
So we have described
three paths,

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:21.550 align:middle line:90%
but they are pretty general.

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:23.930 align:middle line:84%
First is that the
quantum dynamics--

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:30.200 align:middle line:84%
we often interested
in quantum dynamics

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:39.630 align:middle line:84%
of some classical fields,
say, such as, say,

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:43.350 align:middle line:84%
electric magnetic field
or spacetime metric

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:50.440 align:middle line:84%
if you are interested
in gravity, et cetera.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:54.950 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, we already
have the classical field theory,

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:56.740 align:middle line:84%
but we know the world
is quantum and we

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:59.510 align:middle line:84%
want to understand what's
the quantum version of it.

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And the second is that it
unifies special relativity

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.930 align:middle line:90%
plus quantum mechanics.

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:10.820 align:middle line:84%
So you need the field
theory to unify them.

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And the third way is that it's
the large distance description

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.490 align:middle line:90%
of these grid systems.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:33.840 align:middle line:90%


00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:40.190 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, just combining all
three elements together,

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:42.735 align:middle line:84%
they cover many, many
areas of physics.

00:26:42.735 --> 00:26:44.360 align:middle line:84%
They cover many, many
areas of physics.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:48.520 align:middle line:90%


00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.020 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:53.660 align:middle line:84%
So now we can say a
little bit about the plan

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:57.000 align:middle line:90%
for the whole semester.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.330 align:middle line:90%
So here is the plan.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:04.740 align:middle line:84%
So this is like just rephrase
of the outline, which--

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:12.450 align:middle line:90%


00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:16.110 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing we do
in chapter 2-- so here

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.890 align:middle line:90%
is chapter 1.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Chapter 2, we discussed the
simplest field theory just

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:30.330 align:middle line:90%
to squash this equation 2.

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.190 align:middle line:90%
The theory of 2.

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:34.800 align:middle line:90%
2 and 2 prime.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Prime is its equation of motion.

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:40.110 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, we-- in
physics, we always

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:42.330 align:middle line:90%
start with the simplest example.

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:44.440 align:middle line:84%
We always start with
the simplest example.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And so that is the one
we will start with.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.820 align:middle line:84%
So what we will see is
that this describes--

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:55.720 align:middle line:90%


00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.690 align:middle line:84%
that field theory
describe spin is,

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:04.270 align:middle line:90%
is both free massive particles.

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:09.980 align:middle line:90%


00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we will see, when,
we quantize that theory 2,

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:17.480 align:middle line:84%
and then we get the
theory of free massless--

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.060 align:middle line:90%
free spinless massive particles.

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.830 align:middle line:84%
So you say, oh, that's
a little bit boring

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:25.530 align:middle line:84%
because in this series, free--
the particle-- but free means

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:26.940 align:middle line:90%
they don't interact.

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.220 align:middle line:84%
The particle, they
just don't interact.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And then in chapter 3,
we will add interactions.

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:45.410 align:middle line:84%
We will describe how
to treat interactions.

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:49.400 align:middle line:84%
So we going to introduce
interactions and tell you

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.740 align:middle line:84%
how to treat the interactions
between those particles.

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:55.950 align:middle line:90%


00:28:55.950 --> 00:29:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Then in chapter 4, we
go to the real physics.

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:04.520 align:middle line:84%
So the scalar
fields is also real.

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:08.212 align:middle line:84%
Say, for example, it can be used
to describe the Higgs boson.

00:29:08.212 --> 00:29:09.920 align:middle line:84%
But the Higgs boson
maybe is a little bit

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:13.470 align:middle line:84%
far from what we
normally think about.

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So in chapter 4, we will go to
something which is much closer.

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.342 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about the
theory of electron.

00:29:20.342 --> 00:29:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So this is called
the Dirac theory.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.620 align:middle line:90%


00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:31.820 align:middle line:84%
So this theory describes
free spin half particles.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:35.380 align:middle line:90%


00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.250 align:middle line:84%
So this is a theory
of electrons.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:39.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.440 align:middle line:84%
When we neglect
these interactions.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:47.620 align:middle line:84%
So this is the free
spin half particles.

00:29:47.620 --> 00:30:06.715 align:middle line:84%
And then we move on
to the Maxwell theory.

00:30:06.715 --> 00:30:12.940 align:middle line:90%


00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
theory of the quantum

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.950 align:middle line:90%
electric and magnetic field.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:19.650 align:middle line:90%


00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So when you quantize the Maxwell
theory, say, without source,

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:28.440 align:middle line:84%
the vacuum Maxwell theory,
and you find you get free--

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:32.280 align:middle line:90%
again, there's no interaction--

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:38.350 align:middle line:90%
massless spin 1 particle.

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:41.200 align:middle line:84%
The theory of massless
spin 1 particle.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.820 align:middle line:90%


00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So this is what we
call the photon.

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:51.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is a quantum for
electromagnetic fields.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:57.320 align:middle line:90%
And then-- sorry.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Did I-- so this should
be chapter 5 now.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.820 align:middle line:90%
I think I lost my count.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:06.850 align:middle line:84%
So now go to chapter 6, we
combine the 4 and the five

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:15.450 align:middle line:90%
together, combine electrons.

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:20.090 align:middle line:84%
So photon normally
we denote by gamma.

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Combine the theory of
electron and the photon

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:29.480 align:middle line:84%
together, and then plot the
interactions between them.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And then we get the so-called
quantum electrodynamics.

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:38.620 align:middle line:90%


00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:39.715 align:middle line:90%
So this is called QED.

00:31:39.715 --> 00:31:42.580 align:middle line:90%


00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.065 align:middle line:90%
So QED is very general.

00:31:44.065 --> 00:31:49.210 align:middle line:84%
It essentially covers all
the quantum phenomena--

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:52.450 align:middle line:84%
yeah, a macroscopic phenomenon
up to, say, weak interactions

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:53.450 align:middle line:90%
and strong interactions.

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:57.871 align:middle line:84%
If you don't go
inside the nucleus

00:31:57.871 --> 00:32:00.250 align:middle line:84%
or don't go to
very high energy, I

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:05.830 align:middle line:84%
think that covers essentially
most of the physics.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:07.820 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And then we will
describe how to-- yeah,

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:16.370 align:middle line:84%
and then that will be
the end of this course.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So do you have any
questions on this?

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:21.090 align:middle line:90%


00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:21.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:23.060 align:middle line:90%
So this is a road map.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.142 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:32:24.142 --> 00:32:25.850 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Do these
chapters correspond off

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:27.200 align:middle line:84%
of those chapters
in the textbook

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.760 align:middle line:84%
or just chapters in
the lecture notes?

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.802 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: The chapter in
the lecture notes, yeah.

00:32:30.802 --> 00:32:31.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:32.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:33.090 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:34.170 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:34.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.960 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: I'm just
curious if gluon's

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.030 align:middle line:84%
included in the free
massless spin 1 particles?

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:41.092 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:44.235 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Gluons included in the
free massless spin 1 particles

00:32:44.235 --> 00:32:44.860 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Gluon is also massless spin
1, but gluon, actually, they

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:52.130 align:middle line:90%
interact with themselves.

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:53.870 align:middle line:90%
And so gluon is a different.

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:56.110 align:middle line:84%
So gluon-- to
describe gluons, you

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:58.480 align:middle line:84%
have to wait for
quantum field theory 2.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the thing
about the photon

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:03.290 align:middle line:84%
is that the photon don't
interact with itself,

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:05.500 align:middle line:84%
but the gluons
interact with itself.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so essentially, we treat
everything except gluons.

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:11.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:14.520 align:middle line:90%


00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.660 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.410 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:19.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:22.768 align:middle line:84%
So now we can just
move to chapter 2.

00:33:22.768 --> 00:33:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Now we are talking
about this theory.

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:24.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So actually, I
should not erase it.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.120 align:middle line:84%
So now we talk
about this theory.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.820 align:middle line:90%


00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Because this theory
describe free particles,

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:37.890 align:middle line:84%
so we call it a free
scalar field theory.

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:47.530 align:middle line:90%


00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:52.010 align:middle line:84%
So this is the theory
we are interested in.

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:54.520 align:middle line:84%
So now we will describe how
to quantize this theory.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:34:04.670 align:middle line:90%


00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:05.780 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So first, we will quickly
go through the quantization

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:16.090 align:middle line:84%
of harmonic oscillator,
which you should already

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:18.880 align:middle line:90%
have done in your Pset.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And so we can do
it relatively fast.

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:32.469 align:middle line:84%
So the quantization
of harmonic oscillator

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:33.730 align:middle line:90%
in the Heisenberg picture.

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:38.510 align:middle line:90%


00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:40.850 align:middle line:84%
So we will see that
once we understand

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:45.219 align:middle line:84%
this example in the
right way, and then

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:48.429 align:middle line:84%
quantizing this field
theory becomes trivial.

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And quantizing this field
theory becomes trivial.

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:56.139 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's start with
quantum harmonic oscillator.

00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:59.020 align:middle line:90%


00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.780 align:middle line:84%
For simplicity, I
take the mass to be 1,

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:03.790 align:middle line:84%
and to take the
frequency to be 1.

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:06.360 align:middle line:90%


00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:06.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let me put the
frequency here, omega.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:10.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's take the mass to be 1.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.250 align:middle line:90%
And so for this series--

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:18.170 align:middle line:84%
so this is a simple
harmonic oscillator,

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:25.420 align:middle line:84%
which you have seen it maybe for
most of your intellectual life.

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.360 align:middle line:90%
And so P will be x dot.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a momentum-- the
conjugate momentum is x dot.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And so the Hamiltonian is the
P squared divided by 2 plus 1/2

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.470 align:middle line:90%
omega squared x squared.

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And the equation of motion
is x dot --double dot--

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:46.510 align:middle line:90%
equal to x squared.

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:middle line:90%


00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.927 align:middle line:90%
So let's first look at this--

00:35:58.927 --> 00:36:01.010 align:middle line:84%
look at harmonic oscillator
as a classical theory.

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:13.190 align:middle line:90%


00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:17.920 align:middle line:84%
So for classical theory, we
know how to solve this equation.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.720 align:middle line:84%
We just need to
solve this equation.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.880 align:middle line:90%
So classical solution.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:26.560 align:middle line:90%


00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Is given by x t equal to A
cosine omega t plus B sine

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:36.310 align:middle line:90%
omega t.

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And A and B, just some
integration constant.

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:41.490 align:middle line:90%


00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And for convenience, I can also
write it in the complex form.

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Right here is following equal
to a exponential minus i omega

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:55.490 align:middle line:84%
t plus a star
exponential i omega t.

00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:58.640 align:middle line:90%
And a is some complex constant.

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's an
integration constant,

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.760 align:middle line:84%
I just rewrite the integration
constants slightly differently.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.830 align:middle line:90%


00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:10.870 align:middle line:84%
So these are just
integration constants.

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:14.330 align:middle line:84%
So now-- yeah, so this
is a complete solution

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:16.340 align:middle line:90%
of the problem.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.465 align:middle line:90%
So now let's go to quantum.

00:37:17.465 --> 00:37:21.690 align:middle line:90%


00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:26.590 align:middle line:84%
So when we go to
quantum, and then we

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:29.800 align:middle line:84%
replace this classical
dynamical variable,

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:34.540 align:middle line:84%
then become the
Heisenberg operator,

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.430 align:middle line:90%
become the quantum operator.

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:40.800 align:middle line:84%
In particular, in the
Heisenberg picture, and then

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.170 align:middle line:84%
this operator will
depend on time.

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And now this equation
become operator equation.

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So now let's-- maybe I
should label my equation.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.765 align:middle line:84%
So now this star become
an operator equation.

00:37:58.765 --> 00:38:02.324 align:middle line:90%


00:38:02.324 --> 00:38:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Now star is the operator
equation for x hat.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:09.782 align:middle line:84%
So you have exactly
the same equation

00:38:09.782 --> 00:38:11.990 align:middle line:84%
as the classical equation,
but now the interpretation

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:13.600 align:middle line:90%
is different.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.160 align:middle line:90%
Now the x hat becomes the--

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.019 align:middle line:84%
now the x become the
operator equation.

00:38:18.019 --> 00:38:22.330 align:middle line:90%


00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:26.140 align:middle line:90%
So now the solution--

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:27.520 align:middle line:90%
now let me call this star star.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:30.150 align:middle line:90%


00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So this still solves
that equation.

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:34.930 align:middle line:90%


00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:38.380 align:middle line:84%
So this still solves
that equation, except--

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.080 align:middle line:84%
so these are just C numbers,
because this is a function

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:43.660 align:middle line:90%
of t, these are C numbers.

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:45.730 align:middle line:90%
But now x becomes--

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:50.260 align:middle line:84%
so now quantum mechanically,
so these have become now,

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.610 align:middle line:90%
become the quantum solution.

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:55.640 align:middle line:90%


00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:57.320 align:middle line:90%
So now I have hat.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.508 align:middle line:84%
So this still
solves the equation.

00:38:59.508 --> 00:39:01.550 align:middle line:84%
The quantum mechanic
equation just becomes a hat.

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:07.230 align:middle line:90%


00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And so this still
solves that equation,

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:12.330 align:middle line:90%
but these are C numbers.

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:14.430 align:middle line:84%
The left-hand side
is the operator,

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:17.850 align:middle line:84%
and it can only be that A
hat and B hat are operators.

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:20.340 align:middle line:90%
And also, a must be operators.

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And the star we
replace it by dagger.

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:31.760 align:middle line:84%
So now, say-- now a,
you just go to a hat

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.060 align:middle line:90%
and a star goes to a dagger.

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:36.200 align:middle line:90%
A hat dagger.

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:40.520 align:middle line:84%
OK, now these are
integration constants

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.660 align:middle line:90%
for the operator equations.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:43.790 align:middle line:90%
So they are just--

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:46.850 align:middle line:84%
now they become
constant operators.

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:51.440 align:middle line:84%
So they are just constant
quantum operators.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.010 align:middle line:90%


00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:55.790 align:middle line:90%
They're just quantum operators.

00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:59.770 align:middle line:84%
So they are integration
constants for your quantum

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:01.980 align:middle line:90%
operator equations.

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:04.810 align:middle line:90%
So now the solution--

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:08.360 align:middle line:84%
so now the-- yeah, so now
this is your quantum solution.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:12.280 align:middle line:90%


00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:16.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is the form
we will often use.

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.740 align:middle line:84%
You can also use that
form, but the equivalent,

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:22.520 align:middle line:84%
but this is the form
we will often use.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.600 align:middle line:84%
You can also, from here,
you take the derivative,

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.543 align:middle line:84%
you can find the P.
So again, this will

00:40:26.543 --> 00:40:27.710 align:middle line:90%
become an operator equation.

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:29.283 align:middle line:84%
You take the
derivative of x hat--

00:40:29.283 --> 00:40:32.630 align:middle line:84%
x, and then you
find p, et cetera.

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:36.150 align:middle line:90%


00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:42.767 align:middle line:84%
So you-- p hat t, you
just take the derivative.

00:40:42.767 --> 00:40:46.260 align:middle line:90%


00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.410 align:middle line:90%
Then you can just work it out.

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:49.035 align:middle line:90%
It's very easy.

00:40:49.035 --> 00:40:52.430 align:middle line:90%


00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:57.680 align:middle line:90%
So now-- so this equation just--

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.200 align:middle line:84%
so we already solved
the quantum problem

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.600 align:middle line:84%
because we find the full
evolution-- full solution

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.900 align:middle line:84%
to the quantum
operator equation.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Except that we
still need to impose

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:13.620 align:middle line:84%
the canonical
quantization condition.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.490 align:middle line:90%
So this is just equal to i.

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:21.980 align:middle line:84%
So the standard-- so if you
plug in the expression for x

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.120 align:middle line:90%
and the t--

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:31.960 align:middle line:84%
and the p into here, and then
you find that a and a dagger,

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.520 align:middle line:90%
the commutator is equal to 1.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:38.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is your familiar
creation and annihilation

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:42.400 align:middle line:84%
operator for
harmonic oscillator.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.600 align:middle line:90%
For harmonic oscillator.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And now, we can also use the
a to build the Hilbert space

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:55.020 align:middle line:84%
because a are the-- yeah,
because all your operator now--

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:57.150 align:middle line:90%
because x and p--

00:41:57.150 --> 00:42:00.210 align:middle line:84%
x and the p are expressed
in terms of a and a dagger.

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:02.730 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, any
operator of this theory

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:04.950 align:middle line:84%
can all be expressed in
terms of a and a dagger.

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:12.010 align:middle line:90%


00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And then you can just use a and
a dagger because a and a dagger

00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:15.820 align:middle line:90%
essentially--

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:18.580 align:middle line:84%
they are fundamental
building block

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.200 align:middle line:90%
of your full quantum theory.

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And then you can also use that
to build the Hilbert space.

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:28.480 align:middle line:84%
So the Hilbert space is
defined by the lowest

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:42.940 align:middle line:84%
state is annihilated by a,
and then the higher state

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:49.170 align:middle line:84%
obtained by acting a
dagger on the ground state.

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:52.020 align:middle line:90%
So this is your full theory.

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:54.510 align:middle line:90%
So this is your full theory.

00:42:54.510 --> 00:43:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And so now, now you can
compute anything in this theory

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:04.390 align:middle line:84%
just with those knowledge,
just with those knowledge.

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:06.340 align:middle line:84%
So any questions
on this regarding

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:09.710 align:middle line:90%
the harmonic oscillator?

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:10.385 align:middle line:90%
Good, OK.

00:43:10.385 --> 00:43:12.890 align:middle line:90%


00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:16.720 align:middle line:90%
So let me just summarize.

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is very, very
familiar, but let's summarize

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:22.780 align:middle line:90%
the rule we have been using.

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Summarize the steps in context
of the harmonic oscillator.

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And then the same
steps can be used

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:38.750 align:middle line:90%
to quantize the field theory.

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:41.380 align:middle line:90%
Steps of quantization.

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:46.070 align:middle line:90%


00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:48.540 align:middle line:90%
So we make it a general.

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:54.920 align:middle line:84%
So first-- so the 0 step is
that the classical equation

00:43:54.920 --> 00:44:00.175 align:middle line:84%
of motion becomes a
quantum operator equation.

00:44:00.175 --> 00:44:03.040 align:middle line:90%


00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Then the first step is to find
the most general solution--

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:17.050 align:middle line:90%


00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:35.950 align:middle line:84%
to find the most
general solution

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:38.925 align:middle line:84%
to classical
equation of motion--

00:44:38.925 --> 00:44:40.300 align:middle line:84%
yeah, just to
equation of motion.

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:43.150 align:middle line:90%


00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And then you go to
quantum, and then you

00:44:50.760 --> 00:45:01.764 align:middle line:84%
just promote the
integration constants

00:45:01.764 --> 00:45:08.030 align:middle line:84%
in your classical
solution in 1, in step 1

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:11.690 align:middle line:90%
to constant operators--

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:14.360 align:middle line:90%


00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:15.960 align:middle line:90%
constant quantum operators.

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.510 align:middle line:90%


00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:21.580 align:middle line:90%
So this gives the--

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:31.470 align:middle line:84%
then you have the full-time
evolution at the quantum level.

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:37.210 align:middle line:90%


00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Now you know how the
quantum operator evolves.

00:45:42.680 --> 00:46:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And then you impose canonical
quantization conditions.

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:07.870 align:middle line:90%


00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:10.930 align:middle line:84%
So that will tell
you the commutators

00:46:10.930 --> 00:46:15.790 align:middle line:84%
between those integration
constant operators

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:19.210 align:middle line:90%
just as we do here.

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And then constant
operators in 2,

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:48.020 align:middle line:84%
now you know also the
commutation relation

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:48.830 align:middle line:90%
between them--

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:50.930 align:middle line:84%
among them, and
then now can be used

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:58.250 align:middle line:90%
to generate the Hilbert space.

00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:09.310 align:middle line:90%


00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:10.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:15.120 align:middle line:84%
So this step 1 to
4 are very general.

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you can do it, and then
you can essentially do it--

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:23.320 align:middle line:90%
apply it to any system.

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.612 align:middle line:84%
Say one-- harmonic oscillator
is one degree of freedom,

00:47:25.612 --> 00:47:28.112 align:middle line:84%
you can apply it two degrees
freedom, three degrees freedom.

00:47:28.112 --> 00:47:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And also to field theory,
infinite number degrees

00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:31.970 align:middle line:90%
of freedom.

00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And now we will apply
these to field theory.

00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:34.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:37.130 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Do you get the finite
dimensional Hilbert spaces

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:39.020 align:middle line:90%
from this procedure?

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:42.230 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: For this
procedure, you cannot,

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:45.458 align:middle line:84%
but you can get the
finite dimension-- yeah,

00:47:45.458 --> 00:47:47.750 align:middle line:84%
because the finite dimensional
Hilbert space don't have

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:49.130 align:middle line:90%
the classical analog.

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:51.470 align:middle line:84%
So here, we start with
a classical system,

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:52.820 align:middle line:90%
and then we quantize it.

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And the quantum system is a
finite dimensional Hilbert

00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:59.420 align:middle line:90%
space.

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:01.640 align:middle line:84%
They're essentially
intrinsically quantum.

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:03.410 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:04.370 align:middle line:90%
Like spin.

00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Spin is an intrinsic
in quantum, so yeah.

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:08.428 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:48:08.428 --> 00:48:10.970 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: This question is to do
with spin operators, the fact

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:15.450 align:middle line:84%
that there are no finite
dimensional representations

00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:17.620 align:middle line:90%
for these dagger operators.

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:18.205 align:middle line:90%
Any dagger.

00:48:18.205 --> 00:48:19.080 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:21.493 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's just because
they don't have-- yeah--

00:48:21.493 --> 00:48:23.160 align:middle line:84%
yeah, the reason is
just they don't have

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.590 align:middle line:90%
classical counterparts, yeah.

00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:27.100 align:middle line:90%


00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:27.827 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:48:27.827 --> 00:48:30.160 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: It is it always true
that the constant operator

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.285 align:middle line:84%
is sufficient to generate
the entire Hilbert space?

00:48:32.285 --> 00:48:35.410 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, because if
you think about it this way--

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:38.730 align:middle line:84%
that's a very good
question, because--

00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:40.970 align:middle line:84%
let's just look at this
harmonic oscillator,

00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:44.180 align:middle line:84%
and then you can try
to generalize it.

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Because they are integration
constant over the x and the p.

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Then any operator in
your theory can all

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:54.220 align:middle line:84%
be expressed in terms
of a and a dagger.

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And then and then your
Hilbert space must be--

00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:00.630 align:middle line:84%
you must be able to generate
the Hilbert space using them.

00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Because they are the building
block of your whole operator.

00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:05.282 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:49:05.282 --> 00:49:06.990 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: How do you
get the vacuum state?

00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Is there always a
generalization of vacuum state?

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:10.055 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:49:10.055 --> 00:49:11.910 align:middle line:84%
The vacuum state
here is based on--

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:16.080 align:middle line:90%
is coming from the energy.

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:19.590 align:middle line:84%
So once we solve x
and p, and then we

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:22.110 align:middle line:84%
can write the Hamiltonian
in terms of x and p,

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:24.602 align:middle line:84%
and then you just look for
the lowest energy state.

00:49:24.602 --> 00:49:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And then you find the
lowest energy state

00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:27.750 align:middle line:90%
that satisfy this equation.

00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:28.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, you
can find other states.

00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:32.315 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:49:32.315 --> 00:49:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the same
thing we are going

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:35.148 align:middle line:84%
to-- yeah, the same
strategy we are

00:49:35.148 --> 00:49:38.750 align:middle line:84%
going to use for the
quantum field theory.

00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:39.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:41.270 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.800 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.710 align:middle line:90%
So now it become a mechanical.

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:50.380 align:middle line:84%
We can just apply
this to this theory.

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:52.100 align:middle line:84%
We can just apply
this to this theory.

00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:53.960 align:middle line:90%
And now let me add here.

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:58.495 align:middle line:84%
So here, the canonical momentum
density conjugate to phi is--

00:49:58.495 --> 00:50:02.720 align:middle line:84%
I called it pi before, is just
the time derivative of phi.

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And the Hamiltonian density,
you can find it explicitly,

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:10.380 align:middle line:90%
is pi squared plus 1/2.

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:17.990 align:middle line:90%


00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And then this is the
classical equation of motion.

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:20.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:23.860 align:middle line:90%


00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:26.320 align:middle line:84%
So we can-- now let's just
solve this classical equation

00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:26.820 align:middle line:90%
of motion.

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:29.320 align:middle line:90%


00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:32.070 align:middle line:90%
So this equation can be--

00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:35.100 align:middle line:84%
so this equation is
easy to solve because

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:38.730 align:middle line:90%
of the translation symmetry.

00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:41.130 align:middle line:84%
You can just do a
Fourier transform.

00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:45.130 align:middle line:90%
So we can Fourier transform.

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:47.655 align:middle line:90%
So now let's do can--

00:50:47.655 --> 00:50:50.320 align:middle line:90%
you can Fourier transform.

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:56.810 align:middle line:90%
So 2 prime can be solved using--

00:50:56.810 --> 00:51:04.430 align:middle line:90%


00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:06.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:11.900 align:middle line:84%
So we can just write phi
x equal to exponential

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:16.730 align:middle line:90%
minus iEt plus i k dot x.

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:24.260 align:middle line:90%


00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:26.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:27.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you can see then
this just solves the--

00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:48.260 align:middle line:84%
so this is provide a basis
of solutions to 2 prime.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:50.630 align:middle line:84%
It's just a plane wave,
just a plane wave.

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:54.760 align:middle line:90%


00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:57.600 align:middle line:84%
So now when you plug
this into there,

00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:00.690 align:middle line:84%
then you just get the
dispersion relation.

00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Each square should be m
squared plus k squared.

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:11.790 align:middle line:84%
So we'll denote this
as omega k squared.

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:19.500 align:middle line:84%
So omega k is defined to be just
the k squared plus m squared.

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:26.540 align:middle line:90%


00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:29.450 align:middle line:84%
So E-- when you take
the square root of E--

00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:32.810 align:middle line:84%
so you can take
plus-minus omega k.

00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:34.670 align:middle line:90%
Can we plus-minus omega k?

00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So we normally
call the solution--

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:53.050 align:middle line:84%
we normally separate-- so
for historical reasons,

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:55.030 align:middle line:90%
we normally put--

00:52:55.030 --> 00:53:02.110 align:middle line:84%
define u k x to be exponential
minus i omega k t--

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:06.530 align:middle line:90%


00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:07.030 align:middle line:90%
x.

00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:11.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, now we have inserted
the positive root of E.

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:15.875 align:middle line:84%
So this is normally called
the positive energy solution.

00:53:15.875 --> 00:53:20.710 align:middle line:90%


00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Even though this-- even though
this name is a little bit

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:27.640 align:middle line:90%
misleading.

00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:33.490 align:middle line:84%
So actually, this-- we don't
define the energy actually--

00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:35.290 align:middle line:84%
yeah, later we will
see, this is not really

00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:38.710 align:middle line:90%
the energy of a particle.

00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And so this is just
a traditional name.

00:53:41.410 --> 00:53:43.210 align:middle line:90%
This is just a traditional name.

00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:44.650 align:middle line:90%
Conventional name.

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And then you can define
the complex conjugate of k.

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:51.010 align:middle line:90%
And now you have--

00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:57.035 align:middle line:84%
then corresponding, you have
a minus omega k in there.

00:53:57.035 --> 00:54:00.780 align:middle line:90%


00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:06.140 align:middle line:84%
So we take this
complex conjugate.

00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:08.265 align:middle line:84%
And so this is called the
negative energy solution.

00:54:08.265 --> 00:54:13.350 align:middle line:90%


00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:19.530 align:middle line:84%
So altogether, they form a
complete set of solutions.

00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:21.270 align:middle line:90%
So complete set of solutions.

00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:26.150 align:middle line:90%


00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:29.740 align:middle line:84%
So complete basis--
it's a complete set of--

00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:45.678 align:middle line:84%
complete basis is formed by u
k and the u k star for all k.

00:54:45.678 --> 00:54:48.860 align:middle line:90%


00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:50.590 align:middle line:90%
For all k.

00:54:50.590 --> 00:54:52.330 align:middle line:90%
So these are-- when you--

00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:54.370 align:middle line:84%
these are the complete
set of solutions

00:54:54.370 --> 00:54:55.900 align:middle line:90%
to that wave equation.

00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:58.420 align:middle line:90%
So that's just the--

00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:01.120 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:10.380 align:middle line:90%


00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:12.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is just like
a-- classically,

00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:13.880 align:middle line:90%
this is like a wave.

00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:15.990 align:middle line:90%
Just like a plane wave.

00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Which you should also
have seen in 8.03.

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:18.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:22.080 align:middle line:90%


00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:23.170 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:24.640 align:middle line:90%
So now we can find that--

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:27.010 align:middle line:84%
so now we can write
down the most general.

00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:28.100 align:middle line:90%
So this is a basis.

00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:31.020 align:middle line:90%


00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:34.100 align:middle line:84%
So these are the constant part
of the exponential plus-minus i

00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:36.800 align:middle line:90%
omega t here.

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.410 align:middle line:84%
So now we can write down
the most general solutions

00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:43.840 align:middle line:84%
by just putting in the
integration constants.

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:51.740 align:middle line:84%
So the most general
classical solutions.

00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:54.670 align:middle line:90%


00:55:54.670 --> 00:56:01.810 align:middle line:84%
So you can just write phi
x equal to integrate over

00:56:01.810 --> 00:56:06.820 align:middle line:84%
all possible value of k
because this is for all k,

00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:08.335 align:middle line:90%
so we just sum over all of them.

00:56:08.335 --> 00:56:10.850 align:middle line:90%


00:56:10.850 --> 00:56:13.720 align:middle line:90%
And so we so--

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.510 align:middle line:84%
so this factor is
just for convenience.

00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:17.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:18.700 align:middle line:90%
It's just a convention.

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:22.510 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to put it
here, it's just a convention.

00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And then we have a k u k
plus a k star u k star.

00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So this is just the most general
set of solutions with a k

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:41.170 align:middle line:84%
and a k star as
integration constants.

00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:51.020 align:middle line:90%


00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:53.375 align:middle line:84%
So this is a full set of
the integration constant.

00:56:53.375 --> 00:57:00.000 align:middle line:90%


00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:00.500 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:03.100 align:middle line:90%


00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:09.780 align:middle line:84%
So now when you go
to quantum level,

00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:12.620 align:middle line:84%
so now we can just
follow the rule.

00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:16.075 align:middle line:84%
We find the most general
classical solution.

00:57:16.075 --> 00:57:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And in the quantum
level, we just

00:57:17.450 --> 00:57:20.610 align:middle line:90%
promote this to be operator.

00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:25.490 align:middle line:84%
You just put the hat there
and change this to dagger.

00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:28.490 align:middle line:90%


00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:36.290 align:middle line:84%
So now this become the
basis of quantum operators.

00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:40.260 align:middle line:90%


00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:44.310 align:middle line:84%
So these are the full set of
constant quantum operators.

00:57:44.310 --> 00:57:47.740 align:middle line:90%


00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:50.730 align:middle line:90%
And this solves your theory on--

00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:53.380 align:middle line:90%


00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:56.837 align:middle line:84%
so this solves the
operator equation.

00:57:56.837 --> 00:57:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And this solves the
operator equation.

00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:01.240 align:middle line:90%


00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So now the next
thing is to impose

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:10.420 align:middle line:84%
the canonical
commutation relation.

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:19.220 align:middle line:90%


00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:20.990 align:middle line:90%
So first, we have to--

00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:25.050 align:middle line:84%
now we have to do a
little bit thinking.

00:58:25.050 --> 00:58:28.380 align:middle line:84%
So so far, it's just
straightforward,

00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:31.830 align:middle line:84%
but now we have to do
a little bit thinking.

00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So for finite, for
harmonic oscillator,

00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:44.350 align:middle line:84%
or for quantum systems
of a single variable,

00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:46.060 align:middle line:90%
you just have x--

00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:47.065 align:middle line:90%
you just have these.

00:58:47.065 --> 00:58:49.720 align:middle line:90%


00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:50.770 align:middle line:90%
You just have these.

00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And now we need to come up
with a generalization of these

00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:55.660 align:middle line:90%
to a field theory.

00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:58.840 align:middle line:90%


00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:02.620 align:middle line:84%
So we need to come up with a
generalization of that field

00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:08.550 align:middle line:90%
theory corresponding to phi x.

00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:12.310 align:middle line:84%
So now let me making
the time and the spatial

00:59:12.310 --> 00:59:14.500 align:middle line:90%
coordinates separate.

00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And its conjugate
momentum is phi--

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:19.540 align:middle line:90%
is pi.

00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:20.695 align:middle line:90%
Conjugate momentum density.

00:59:20.695 --> 00:59:24.990 align:middle line:90%


00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:26.615 align:middle line:84%
So we should do them
at the same time.

00:59:26.615 --> 00:59:29.820 align:middle line:90%


00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Remember, p is the same
evolution operator,

00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:36.160 align:middle line:84%
so they have to be
evaluated at the same time.

00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.720 align:middle line:90%
So it's equal time.

00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Canonical quantization
conditions

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:41.665 align:middle line:90%
always are the equal time.

00:59:41.665 --> 00:59:44.540 align:middle line:90%


00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:47.160 align:middle line:90%
But x is a label of operators.

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So x, they don't
have to be the same.

00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:51.780 align:middle line:84%
So hee, it can be x;
here, can be x prime.

00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:52.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:55.340 align:middle line:84%
So now we have to come up with
a generalization of what is

00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:57.020 align:middle line:90%
this quantity for field theory.

00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:00.390 align:middle line:90%


01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:03.580 align:middle line:84%
So now we just need to do
a little bit of guesswork.

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:04.950 align:middle line:90%
You can easily guess it.

01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:07.417 align:middle line:90%


01:00:07.417 --> 01:00:09.750 align:middle line:84%
So before we do that, do you
have any questions on this?

01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:10.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.590 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: x is already the
operator in this feature?

01:00:13.590 --> 01:00:15.390 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah,
yeah. x is always--

01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:19.140 align:middle line:84%
so x is always-- here,
it's always just the label

01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:21.060 align:middle line:90%
of the spatial location.

01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's a label
for the-- yeah, yeah,

01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:24.900 align:middle line:90%
it's your field theory label.

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:25.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:27.480 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So in this
procedure, I guess

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.640 align:middle line:84%
you always end up
with your operators

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.230 align:middle line:90%
as being constant in time.

01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Is there any way
that you can get them

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:36.510 align:middle line:84%
where it's like the evolution
is more complex rather

01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:39.335 align:middle line:84%
than just a constant
operator and phase factor?

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:39.960 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.570 align:middle line:84%
So normally, if you have
second-order differential

01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:45.600 align:middle line:84%
equation, you always have
some integration constant.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's it.

01:00:46.350 --> 01:00:46.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:49.440 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So that carries
forward all throughout?

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.090 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:51.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:54.300 align:middle line:90%


01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:57.280 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:57.977 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:00:57.977 --> 01:01:00.310 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Should it be obvious
why the classical equation

01:01:00.310 --> 01:01:02.620 align:middle line:84%
of motion translates
directly into the operator

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.573 align:middle line:90%
equation of motion?

01:01:03.573 --> 01:01:04.240 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Right.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:04.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:06.880 align:middle line:90%
So that's a very good--

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:11.120 align:middle line:90%
that's a very good question.

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's just an extension
of our usual procedure

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.750 align:middle line:90%
for the quantum mechanics.

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:19.300 align:middle line:84%
So the usual
procedure, when you--

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:20.920 align:middle line:84%
even just for the
harmonic oscillator

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.883 align:middle line:84%
for single-variable system,
you have this correspondence

01:01:23.883 --> 01:01:26.050 align:middle line:84%
between the classical system
and the quantum system.

01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:27.820 align:middle line:84%
When you quantize
the classical system,

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:29.362 align:middle line:84%
then the classical
equation of motion

01:01:29.362 --> 01:01:32.080 align:middle line:84%
become a quantum
operator equation.

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Here, we just use the same rule
because quantum field theory

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:38.110 align:middle line:84%
is just the theory of infinite
number of degrees freedoms.

01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:40.340 align:middle line:84%
We are not changing the
rule of quantum mechanics.

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:42.640 align:middle line:90%
And so that's why we just--

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:45.100 align:middle line:84%
again, just promote
the classical equation

01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:46.390 align:middle line:90%
into the operator equation.

01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:50.820 align:middle line:90%


01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:52.640 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:56.000 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: One way of
understanding the Heisenberg

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.790 align:middle line:84%
equations for the quantum
mechanics is really

01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:02.180 align:middle line:84%
the Poisson brackets for
the classical theory.

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:06.245 align:middle line:84%
Is there something like that
for field theory as well?

01:02:06.245 --> 01:02:06.898 align:middle line:90%
I guess the--

01:02:06.898 --> 01:02:08.690 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah,
yeah, there is, yeah.

01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So classically, you can
define the Poisson bracket

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:15.230 align:middle line:84%
between the classical
field variables.

01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And then quantum
mechanically, it just

01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:20.620 align:middle line:90%
become quantum commutators.

01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:23.120 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Is that how we could
come up with those commutation

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:23.668 align:middle line:90%
relations?

01:02:23.668 --> 01:02:25.460 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah,
you can also do that.

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:26.160 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:26.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:30.290 align:middle line:84%
So one way to come to this is
you first describe-- first,

01:02:30.290 --> 01:02:34.410 align:middle line:84%
you need to generalize
your standard Poisson

01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:38.490 align:middle line:84%
bracket for finite number equals
freedom to classical field

01:02:38.490 --> 01:02:42.040 align:middle line:84%
theory, and then you can just
generalize that to the quantum.

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, indeed.

01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:44.760 align:middle line:90%
That's one route of doing it.

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.390 align:middle line:90%


01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:50.530 align:middle line:90%
OK, other questions?

01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:51.190 align:middle line:90%
Good?

01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:53.290 align:middle line:90%
So we can just guess the answer.

01:02:53.290 --> 01:02:56.770 align:middle line:84%
The answer is very
easy to guess.

01:02:56.770 --> 01:03:10.920 align:middle line:84%
So remember-- so if you
have a single x and a p,

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.580 align:middle line:90%
that's what you have.

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:27.230 align:middle line:84%
But if you have more
than one particles,

01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:32.020 align:middle line:84%
if you have more than one
particles, say just hint.

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.840 align:middle line:90%


01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Say you have multiple particles
system in quantum mechanics,

01:03:44.110 --> 01:03:49.740 align:middle line:84%
and then you have x a and p
a as your dynamical variable.

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:55.460 align:middle line:84%
So a equal to 1 to, say, n,
say, the number of particles.

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And then your canonical
quantization condition

01:03:57.770 --> 01:04:08.134 align:middle line:84%
just become x a t p b
t equal to i delta a b.

01:04:08.134 --> 01:04:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And that different x a commute
and different p commute

01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:30.060 align:middle line:90%
given the p commute.

01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Some reason, let me
just put this out.

01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:40.560 align:middle line:90%


01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:45.360 align:middle line:84%
So now this a and
b are essentially

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:48.030 align:middle line:90%
just replaced by x and x prime.

01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:50.940 align:middle line:84%
So x and x prime are just
continuum version of those

01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:52.680 align:middle line:90%
a and b.

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Remember that we can't
emphasize the x and the x prime

01:04:55.110 --> 01:04:58.750 align:middle line:84%
are the labels of your
degrees of freedom.

01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:59.955 align:middle line:90%
So now you can just guess--

01:04:59.955 --> 01:05:03.040 align:middle line:90%


01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:08.160 align:middle line:84%
so we must have the
following scene.

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So from here, we must have
phi t, x phi t, x prime

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:22.560 align:middle line:90%
must be 0, and then pi t, x--

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:26.820 align:middle line:90%
so pi is the analog of p here.

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:30.000 align:middle line:90%
yeah, so those are operators.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.230 align:middle line:90%
t, x prime must be 0.

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And then phi t, x
with pi t, x prime

01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:46.370 align:middle line:84%
should be something--
can only be 0,

01:05:46.370 --> 01:05:50.020 align:middle line:84%
when x not equal to
x prime, can only

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:51.820 align:middle line:90%
be 0 when x equal to x prime.

01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:56.420 align:middle line:90%


01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:58.075 align:middle line:90%
OK, as a generalization of this.

01:05:58.075 --> 01:06:01.630 align:middle line:90%


01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And so you can-- now you can
guess, so what should this be?

01:06:06.130 --> 01:06:09.400 align:middle line:90%


01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.490 align:middle line:90%
So-- yeah?

01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:12.880 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: So direct delta?

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:15.790 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, this
should be just Dirac delta.

01:06:15.790 --> 01:06:17.230 align:middle line:84%
But now you can
ask the question,

01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:18.880 align:middle line:90%
why has to be direct delta?

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Maybe why should not be, say,
the derivatives of Dirac delta?

01:06:24.290 --> 01:06:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Say, why should not be,
say, 100th derivative

01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:middle line:90%
of Dirac delta?

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And that question
can be addressed just

01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:35.050 align:middle line:90%
by from dimensional analysis.

01:06:35.050 --> 01:06:36.990 align:middle line:90%
So here, we know--

01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:38.910 align:middle line:84%
somehow this must be
related to Dirac delta,

01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:41.250 align:middle line:90%
and now let's decide.

01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:43.950 align:middle line:84%
So now you can do the
dimension-- do a little bit

01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:47.020 align:middle line:90%
dimensional analysis.

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you just write
down the action--

01:06:50.490 --> 01:06:52.170 align:middle line:84%
yeah, the action I
have just erased.

01:06:52.170 --> 01:06:53.070 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

01:06:53.070 --> 01:06:55.320 align:middle line:84%
So if you look back
on the action--

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.630 align:middle line:84%
let me just outline
the idea because I'm

01:06:57.630 --> 01:07:00.280 align:middle line:84%
sure you can do dimensional
analysis yourself.

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:02.310 align:middle line:90%
So if you look at the action--

01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:04.710 align:middle line:84%
so the action is dimensionless
in the natural unit

01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:06.790 align:middle line:90%
we are using.

01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So from that, you can
deduce the dimension of phi

01:07:12.850 --> 01:07:17.900 align:middle line:84%
to be 1 over L-- so
1 over the length.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.150 align:middle line:90%
And from the fact that the pi--

01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:23.360 align:middle line:90%


01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:24.230 align:middle line:90%
where's pi?

01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I have also
erased-- is equal to phi dot,

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:32.450 align:middle line:84%
means pi should be dimension
1 over L squared because you

01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:34.520 align:middle line:84%
take the derivative on
time, and then there's

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:37.070 align:middle line:90%
another factor of L.

01:07:37.070 --> 01:07:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Then that means, on the
right-hand side here,

01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:44.180 align:middle line:84%
must be something
1 over L to a cube

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:46.790 align:middle line:84%
because there's no
other parameters here.

01:07:46.790 --> 01:07:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because here,
there should be an i.

01:07:50.570 --> 01:07:53.302 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a
dimension 1 over cube,

01:07:53.302 --> 01:07:55.010 align:middle line:84%
there can only be the
delta function, not

01:07:55.010 --> 01:07:59.120 align:middle line:84%
the 100th derivative
of delta functions.

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:01.130 align:middle line:84%
So this thing should be
just a delta function.

01:08:01.130 --> 01:08:04.970 align:middle line:90%


01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:08.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is the convention
that there should be i.

01:08:08.330 --> 01:08:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And then it should be just
the free delta function.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And this indeed have the
dimension of 1 over L cube.

01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:21.109 align:middle line:90%


01:08:21.109 --> 01:08:23.060 align:middle line:90%
Good?

01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:26.120 align:middle line:90%
So now, you can just plug--

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:30.220 align:middle line:84%
so you have the
expression for x, for phi.

01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:33.040 align:middle line:84%
You take the time
derivative of this,

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:36.970 align:middle line:84%
you get the expression
for pi, and now

01:08:36.970 --> 01:08:39.640 align:middle line:84%
you can just plug
them into here,

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:42.399 align:middle line:84%
you can just plug
them into here.

01:08:42.399 --> 01:08:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you can find the
commutation relation between

01:08:44.710 --> 01:08:46.630 align:middle line:90%
those a k's.

01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a slightly
tedious calculation,

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:54.590 align:middle line:84%
which is, however, a little
bit fun, which, of course,

01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:58.109 align:middle line:90%
I will leave you to do.

01:08:58.109 --> 01:09:02.779 align:middle line:84%
So if you just plug them in,
and then you can deduce that

01:09:02.779 --> 01:09:05.939 align:middle line:84%
the following commutation
relation between a's.

01:09:05.939 --> 01:09:09.439 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- I think
this is in Pset 2,

01:09:09.439 --> 01:09:11.420 align:middle line:90%
but I can still change my mind.

01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:14.479 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I wanted to put in Pset 2.

01:09:14.479 --> 01:09:18.920 align:middle line:84%
So you find the commutator
between a and the commutator

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:19.715 align:middle line:90%
between a dagger--

01:09:19.715 --> 01:09:23.010 align:middle line:90%


01:09:23.010 --> 01:09:25.800 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so now, we
will suppress the hat

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:29.250 align:middle line:84%
because if I write hat
I think over and over

01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:30.029 align:middle line:90%
will be too tired.

01:09:30.029 --> 01:09:33.760 align:middle line:90%


01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.189 align:middle line:90%
So these are 0.

01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:40.074 align:middle line:84%
So the commutation relation
between a and 0, and a--

01:09:40.074 --> 01:09:43.210 align:middle line:90%


01:09:43.210 --> 01:09:52.844 align:middle line:90%
between-- within a and a dagger.

01:09:52.844 --> 01:09:56.020 align:middle line:90%


01:09:56.020 --> 01:10:00.980 align:middle line:84%
So this gives you 2 pi
cube delta function in k.

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:03.630 align:middle line:90%


01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So this is a three
delta function k.

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:10.590 align:middle line:90%


01:10:10.590 --> 01:10:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is a
straightforward generalization,

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:18.200 align:middle line:84%
so if you have multiple
harmonic oscillators--

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.680 align:middle line:84%
so if you have considered the
multiple harmonic oscillators

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:23.950 align:middle line:84%
before, and then the a
between the different harmonic

01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:25.840 align:middle line:84%
oscillator because
k prime are just--

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.240 align:middle line:90%
here, just corresponding to--

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.860 align:middle line:90%
essentially you have-- yeah.

01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Here, this is-- essentially,
you have infinite number

01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:33.700 align:middle line:90%
of harmonic oscillators.

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And each one of
them labeled by a k.

01:10:36.610 --> 01:10:38.215 align:middle line:90%
So this is just like--

01:10:38.215 --> 01:10:40.465 align:middle line:84%
essentially we find-- yeah,
let me just write it here.

01:10:40.465 --> 01:10:44.360 align:middle line:90%


01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:48.160 align:middle line:84%
So from those
commutation relation,

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:59.450 align:middle line:84%
we conclude this theory,
when we quantize--

01:10:59.450 --> 01:11:13.060 align:middle line:84%
after we quantize it,
become an infinite number

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:15.580 align:middle line:84%
independent harmonic
oscillators,

01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:17.320 align:middle line:90%
decoupled harmonic oscillators.

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:21.720 align:middle line:90%


01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Harmonic oscillators labeled
by continuous parameter k.

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:34.130 align:middle line:90%


01:11:34.130 --> 01:11:35.720 align:middle line:90%
So k is-- yeah.

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:36.770 align:middle line:90%
k is the wave number.

01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:44.710 align:middle line:90%


01:11:44.710 --> 01:11:50.620 align:middle line:84%
So for each k,
there is a, and a--

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:54.880 align:middle line:84%
so between a themselves, it's
0; between a daggers, it's 0;

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:59.200 align:middle line:84%
but a, a dagger,
they not equal to 0.

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And so this is, again, the
continuum generalization of 1.

01:12:03.490 --> 01:12:06.160 align:middle line:84%
This is a continuum
generalization of 1

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:08.020 align:middle line:84%
because you have a
continuous variables.

01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:08.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:11.500 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So how about
the commutation relations

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:13.740 align:middle line:90%
of different times?

01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:15.960 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, then
you cannot say for sure.

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:18.810 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Like by
Lorentz invariance

01:12:18.810 --> 01:12:21.480 align:middle line:84%
x and t be on the same plane,
shouldn't we have the same--

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.460 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:27.270 align:middle line:84%
No, but you see the
quantization condition

01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:29.050 align:middle line:90%
is in quantum mechanics.

01:12:29.050 --> 01:12:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Quantum mechanics, t and x
are not on the same footing.

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.710 align:middle line:84%
You can require your
action to be-- x and t

01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:36.030 align:middle line:90%
to be on the same footing.

01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Once you start
quantize your theory,

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:42.030 align:middle line:84%
and then t will have
a pronounced role.

01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:43.710 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: OK, so
if I wanted to, I

01:12:43.710 --> 01:12:46.440 align:middle line:84%
couldn't write like the
commutation relation

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.570 align:middle line:90%
as functions of for vector x?

01:12:48.570 --> 01:12:49.112 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: No.

01:12:49.112 --> 01:12:49.945 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: --delta x--

01:12:49.945 --> 01:12:51.210 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: No, no, no, no, no.

01:12:51.210 --> 01:12:52.650 align:middle line:84%
The canonical
commutation relation

01:12:52.650 --> 01:12:54.630 align:middle line:84%
have to be imposed
at equal time.

01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:59.290 align:middle line:90%


01:12:59.290 --> 01:13:01.470 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:03.360 align:middle line:90%
Good?

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:08.200 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:12.220 align:middle line:90%
So essentially, we just get--

01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:13.990 align:middle line:90%
and now it's just trivial.

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:16.790 align:middle line:84%
So you can just build
up your Hilbert space.

01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, you just
have infinite number

01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:20.610 align:middle line:90%
of harmonic oscillators.

01:13:20.610 --> 01:13:22.960 align:middle line:84%
You just have infinite number
of harmonic oscillators.

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's no surprise,
you get infinite number

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:29.110 align:middle line:84%
of harmonic oscillators because
we mentioned that this field

01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:32.740 align:middle line:84%
theory can be actually
written as a continuum

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:37.150 align:middle line:84%
limit of these
particles on the chain,

01:13:37.150 --> 01:13:39.570 align:middle line:84%
which, in these 8.03
three examples, you know,

01:13:39.570 --> 01:13:41.730 align:middle line:84%
that's just a
harmonic oscillator.

01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Once you find the
lower modes, they're

01:13:44.610 --> 01:13:47.187 align:middle line:84%
all just a bunch of
harmonic oscillators.

01:13:47.187 --> 01:13:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is just a
three-dimensional version

01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:51.420 align:middle line:90%
of that.

01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:53.100 align:middle line:90%
And now we will--

01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:59.200 align:middle line:84%
yeah, today we are
running out of time.

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So next time, we will
see that each excitations

01:14:02.370 --> 01:14:05.640 align:middle line:84%
of the harmonic oscillator
can be interpreted

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:07.950 align:middle line:90%
as a spacetime particle.

01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:09.760 align:middle line:90%
So that's the cool thing of it.

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And now you have this infinite
number of harmonic oscillator,

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.230 align:middle line:90%
and now you can act--

01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:17.460 align:middle line:84%
now you can define the vacuum,
and then act this creation

01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:18.840 align:middle line:90%
operators on the vacuum.

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And now you find each excitation
actually corresponding

01:14:21.150 --> 01:14:24.690 align:middle line:90%
to a particle and has the--

01:14:24.690 --> 01:14:26.460 align:middle line:84%
corresponding to a
relativistic particle.

01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you can have
actually arbitrary number

01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:31.920 align:middle line:90%
of particles in this theory.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, because you can excite
as many times as you want.

01:14:36.570 --> 01:14:38.990 align:middle line:90%
Each excitation is a particle.

01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:39.740 align:middle line:90%
Good, good.

01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:42.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I think it's
a good time-- yeah,

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:45.110 align:middle line:84%
we are two minutes,
I think, early,

01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:49.540 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's a very
good place to break.

01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:53.000 align:middle line:90%
