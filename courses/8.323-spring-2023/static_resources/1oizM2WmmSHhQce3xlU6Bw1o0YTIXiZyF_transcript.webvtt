00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.040 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: So last time,
we more or less finished

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:24.990 align:middle line:84%
discussing quantization of
the free scalar field theory.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And then we showed that the
excitations of that theory

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:84%
essentially give rise to
relativistic particles.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And so we also discussed
various other things--

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.200 align:middle line:84%
so structure of
the Hilbert space,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.360 align:middle line:90%
conserved quantities, et cetera.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.760 align:middle line:90%


00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:84%
So at the end, we
talked about how

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:04.890 align:middle line:84%
to understand the conserved
charge at the quantum level.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:19.940 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.390 align:middle line:84%
So classically-- so we have a,
say, symmetric transformation--

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.180 align:middle line:84%
means that if you take phi
a to some phi a prime--

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.230 align:middle line:84%
phi a prime, normally, we write
it in the infinitesimal way--

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.030 align:middle line:84%
introduce some parameter
a-- some parameter epsilon.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And I can also have
multiple symmetries.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.200 align:middle line:84%
So for each transformation--
say I have epsilon.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.420 align:middle line:84%
So alpha labels different
transformations, and then--

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.080 align:middle line:84%
so this is the transformation,
which can depend on phi a.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Also depends on its
derivatives, et cetera.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And then if you have such
a symmetric transformation

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.030 align:middle line:84%
we discussed before, then that
generates a conserved current,

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.889 align:middle line:90%
and that is labeled by alpha.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Alpha just denotes
different conserved current.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And then yeah, so
it is conserved.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.480 align:middle line:90%


00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.060 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
classical statement.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.370 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, also Noether's
theorem tells us

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.450 align:middle line:84%
how to write down such
a current explicitly.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.280 align:middle line:90%


00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.220 align:middle line:90%
So we can just write it as--

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.050 align:middle line:84%
the current can be
written explicitly.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:84%
So k mu is the transformation
of the Lagrangian density.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Suppose under this
transformation the Lagrangian

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.290 align:middle line:84%
density transform as, say,
alpha partial mu, k mu alpha.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.830 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.300 align:middle line:90%
So alpha, it doesn't matter.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Alpha just label different
symmetries-- the index.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.970 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
whether it's up or down.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.908 align:middle line:84%
And then the zeroth
component of the charge--

00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:24.200 align:middle line:84%
zeroth component of the
current when you integrate over

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.220 align:middle line:84%
all space then give rise
to a conserved charge.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:40.620 align:middle line:84%
So this is conserved
charge times the--

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.720 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.920 align:middle line:90%
So now, let's discuss--

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.570 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.340 align:middle line:84%
so when you go to
quantum level--

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.390 align:middle line:84%
so when you quantize the
theory, and this just becomes

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.060 align:middle line:84%
quantum operator,
and the whole current

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.040 align:middle line:90%
becomes a quantum operator.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And then Q is also
a quantum operator.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.010 align:middle line:90%
So the quantum level--

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:10.080 align:middle line:90%


00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.970 align:middle line:90%
and now Q alpha--

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.850 align:middle line:84%
because it's conserved,
so this becomes

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.410 align:middle line:90%
time-independent operator.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.930 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.310 align:middle line:84%
We see explicitly in the case
of the, say, Hamiltonian dens--

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:90%
Hamiltonian and the momentum.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.420 align:middle line:84%
So we showed explicitly they
actually don't depend on time.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.130 align:middle line:84%
But at the quantum
mechanical level,

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.980 align:middle line:84%
actually, this Q can play
a more important role.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.100 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it can be viewed as
a generator of symmetries.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:47.630 align:middle line:90%
So we can show--

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.080 align:middle line:90%


00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.660 align:middle line:84%
we will show the
following statement--

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.860 align:middle line:84%
that if you consider
so epsilon--

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.510 align:middle line:90%
so consider such a quantity--

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.050 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.870 align:middle line:84%
can you see the commutator
of Q with phi a.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.110 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.000 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's
continue over to here.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.030 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.050 align:middle line:90%
Maybe just let me write it here.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And that generates minus
epsilon alpha f alpha a.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.590 align:middle line:84%
So the commutator of this Q
alpha epsilon alpha with phi a

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.790 align:middle line:84%
essentially generates this
transformation, essentially,

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.250 align:middle line:84%
generate this infinitesimal
transformation.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:90%


00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we call the
Q alpha also generator

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.410 align:middle line:90%
of symmetries.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:54.660 align:middle line:90%


00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is the statement
I'm going to show very soon.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.390 align:middle line:84%
So before I do that, do
you have any questions?

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.360 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: In the conserved
current equation,

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.840 align:middle line:84%
how can f have an alpha
in the upper index

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.803 align:middle line:84%
when J has an alpha in the
lower index, its not meaningful?

00:06:10.803 --> 00:06:11.470 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Just alpha-- don't worry about
the location of alpha index.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Alpha just label a different
current and just went-- yeah,

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.060 align:middle line:84%
here, we don't worry
about its notation.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.660 align:middle line:84%
I just put it up and down
just for convenience.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.910 align:middle line:90%


00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.310 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.315 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:06:32.315 --> 00:06:33.940 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Can you
[INAUDIBLE] positions

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.020 align:middle line:90%
is that a sum over alpha?

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.550 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.340 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: In the
proposed, var L is

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.730 align:middle line:84%
epsilon alpha partial to
mu alpha, is that a sum

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.720 align:middle line:90%
over all alpha?

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
sum over all alphas.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.990 align:middle line:90%
So any repeated indices is sum.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.880 align:middle line:90%
So if you only have one--

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.710 align:middle line:84%
so for example, if you have
one epsilon-- of course,

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.740 align:middle line:84%
there is no sum, but if you
have two different charges,

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:59.990 align:middle line:90%
and then this is sum.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:90%


00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.590 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.760 align:middle line:90%


00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.500 align:middle line:84%
So we are going to
show this statement.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And so this statement
is very easy

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:19.210 align:middle line:90%
to show in the general case.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So let me call
this equation star.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So let's first
consider the case--

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.665 align:middle line:84%
first, let's consider
the sub case that the--

00:07:29.665 --> 00:07:33.360 align:middle line:90%


00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:44.100 align:middle line:84%
let's first suppose f a alpha--
just this transformation

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:84%
of phi a does not contain
the time derivative of phi a.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And also the zeroth component
of the k is equal to 0.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:10.560 align:middle line:90%
Let's consider a first spec--

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.685 align:middle line:90%
a more limited case.

00:08:11.685 --> 00:08:16.830 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.890 align:middle line:84%
So this more limited
case actually

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:22.510 align:middle line:90%
covers many, many examples.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:26.280 align:middle line:84%
It actually covers a
majority of examples.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.580 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you look at
the translation symmetry,

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.510 align:middle line:84%
which gives rise to
the stress tensor--

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.690 align:middle line:84%
so this will-- so this
applies to the case I mu--

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.650 align:middle line:90%
T mu i.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.380 align:middle line:84%
So this corresponding
to the spatial--

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:84%
so this is the conserved current
corresponding to the spatial.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is the current
for spatial translations.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:56.820 align:middle line:90%


00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.710 align:middle line:84%
When we do spatial
translations, then of course,

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:04.590 align:middle line:84%
this f given by the
spatial derivatives,

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.890 align:middle line:84%
and then it does not
involve time derivative.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And in that case, the k
also does not involve in--

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.350 align:middle line:90%
k 0 component's 0.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just I try
to remind myself

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.820 align:middle line:90%
of what you worked in your pset.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And so for this example,
i is the counterpart--

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.770 align:middle line:90%
is the alpha here.

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:30.390 align:middle line:84%
So for each direction, you have
a translation, and so this--

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.170 align:middle line:84%
so the alpha-- of course,
i is the alpha here

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.940 align:middle line:90%
and the mu is the J mu here.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.670 align:middle line:90%


00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And also this applies
to the case which--

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:49.200 align:middle line:90%
for all internal symmetries.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:58.000 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.360 align:middle line:84%
By internal symmetries, we
mean the transformations don't

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.660 align:middle line:90%
involve space-time coordinates.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.390 align:middle line:84%
For example, you
did in your pset

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:11.395 align:middle line:84%
the complex scalar field which
you can just rotate by phase.

00:10:11.395 --> 00:10:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's called the
internal transformation

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.220 align:middle line:84%
because that
transformation does not

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.910 align:middle line:90%
involve spacetime coordinates.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.970 align:middle line:84%
In contrast, when we
find the stress tensor,

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.970 align:middle line:84%
we will do a
spacetime translation,

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.480 align:middle line:90%
and that does involve spacetime.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So this corresponding to the
spacetime transformations--

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.950 align:middle line:90%
spacetime symmetries.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- the phase is
the internal symmetries.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:41.050 align:middle line:84%
So for all internal symmetries,
you don't-- the transformation

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.020 align:middle line:84%
will not contain
the time derivative.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.090 align:middle line:90%


00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:51.970 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, then it's
easy because in this case,

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:57.130 align:middle line:84%
then we just have the one-- then
the zeroth component of J mu.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.200 align:middle line:90%
J just given by--

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:05.540 align:middle line:84%
the first term by definition
is just the canonical momentum

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:11.090 align:middle line:90%
conjugate to the a.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So the first factor, partial L
partial partial mu phi a-- when

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.440 align:middle line:90%
you set mu equal to 0--

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.270 align:middle line:84%
so that's just the
derivative with respect

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.180 align:middle line:84%
to the time derivative of phi
a, and that, by definition,

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:30.020 align:middle line:84%
is just the canonical momentum
density conjugate to phi a.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:37.252 align:middle line:90%
And then you have f alpha a--

00:11:37.252 --> 00:11:38.130 align:middle line:90%
f a alpha.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:42.940 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:43.440 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:51.450 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:57.650 align:middle line:84%
So let me just make one
comment on this expression.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:01.690 align:middle line:84%
So this expression, of
course, classically, you

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.800 align:middle line:90%
can write whatever way you want.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.350 align:middle line:84%
But quantum
mechanically, there's

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.740 align:middle line:84%
a very important subtlety
because this typically

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:13.360 align:middle line:84%
will involve phi, and
then this is momentum,

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.430 align:middle line:84%
and they don't
necessarily commute.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
field theory version

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:23.590 align:middle line:84%
of so-called operator ordering
ambiguity, which is already

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:24.670 align:middle line:90%
in quantum mechanics.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:28.388 align:middle line:84%
In quantum mechanics, when
you go from classical--

00:12:28.388 --> 00:12:30.430 align:middle line:84%
even it's already in the
non-relativistic quantum

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:31.000 align:middle line:90%
mechanics.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.710 align:middle line:84%
When you go to
classical mechanics

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.720 align:middle line:84%
to quantum mechanics,
and then there's

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.630 align:middle line:84%
an issue how you order
operators when you

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:41.200 align:middle line:90%
have x and p at the same time.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:51.670 align:middle line:84%
So here, you also have potential
operator ordering ambiguity.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.080 align:middle line:90%
You have to pay attention.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:58.910 align:middle line:90%


00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Often, such kind of
ambiguities can be resolved

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.810 align:middle line:90%
by physical considerations.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:09.350 align:middle line:84%
So we will see some
examples in a little bit.

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.353 align:middle line:90%


00:13:12.353 --> 00:13:13.770 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's just
imagine there's

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.560 align:middle line:84%
some ordering we
have chosen, and now

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.060 align:middle line:90%
let's look at this commutator.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.740 align:middle line:84%
So we can just write
down the definition.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:34.240 align:middle line:84%
So this is just integrating
over all spatial direction

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:40.690 align:middle line:84%
epsilon alpha, and then we
have pi a f a alpha phi a.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.300 align:middle line:90%


00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let me just--

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:49.850 align:middle line:84%
sorry-- here, let me call
phi b, because the phi a--

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.180 align:middle line:90%
now, they are differ--

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.400 align:middle line:90%
so these two indices are summed.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So let me call them b, and
then you have phi a here.

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:04.640 align:middle line:84%
So now, you can use commutation
relation between the momentum

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.750 align:middle line:90%
density and the phi phi.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.770 align:middle line:84%
So we discussed in
general that the--

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.320 align:middle line:90%
so we discussed the scalar case.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:20.060 align:middle line:84%
But in general, you have this
commutation relation of--

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:24.740 align:middle line:90%
which is delta 3--

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:30.200 align:middle line:84%
say if this is the x,
and this is x prime,

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.690 align:middle line:84%
and then this is x minus
x prime, and delta ab.

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:40.420 align:middle line:84%
So each one is only have a
canonical conjugate momentum

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.280 align:middle line:90%
with its own momentum.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.800 align:middle line:84%
If they have different
fields, then of course yeah.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.940 align:middle line:90%
So you have that.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.900 align:middle line:90%
And now, if you use this--

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.130 align:middle line:90%
so here is x.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let me call this
prime and this to be x.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:02.660 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, I should label
more explicitly x here,

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.225 align:middle line:90%
and then here would be x.

00:15:05.225 --> 00:15:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And so here is x, and
here will be x prime.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, I didn't leave
myself enough space.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.030 align:middle line:90%
Let me just rewrite it.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:16.840 align:middle line:90%


00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:23.830 align:middle line:84%
So this gives me d3 x
prime epsilon alpha.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Then, I will have this pi a,
then x prime f alpha a x prime,

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:40.310 align:middle line:90%
and then this commutator with--

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:43.060 align:middle line:90%
yeah, not covariant.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:46.340 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, alpha is upstairs.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:90%
b and then phi x.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.910 align:middle line:90%


00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, so we
can evaluate this,

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.930 align:middle line:84%
say, for example,
all at t equal to 0.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:00.070 align:middle line:90%
So I suppress the t.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:02.800 align:middle line:90%


00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And then yeah-- and now, you
can just trivially use this

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:12.930 align:middle line:84%
commutation relation, and then
this just gives you minus i

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:20.270 align:middle line:84%
epsilon alpha f
alpha a fa alpha x--

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.350 align:middle line:90%
evaluate at x.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:25.400 align:middle line:90%


00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So that just confirms
that expression.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:34.130 align:middle line:90%


00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So this is not satisfied when
you have time translation.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.410 align:middle line:90%
So for time translation--

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:47.320 align:middle line:84%
so first, any questions on
this in this simple case?

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.890 align:middle line:90%
The idea is very simple.

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Essentially just the first term
proportional to the momentum,

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:54.585 align:middle line:90%
and the momentum--

00:16:54.585 --> 00:16:58.790 align:middle line:84%
a conjugate to this, and
then you just take that.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:59.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.415 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Did we not
get a term with the f

00:17:01.415 --> 00:17:03.849 align:middle line:84%
alpha a and phi because
of our restriction?

00:17:03.849 --> 00:17:04.849 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so if there's
no partial zero--

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:09.800 align:middle line:84%
if there's no time
derivative here,

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.990 align:middle line:84%
it means there's
no momentum here.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.579 align:middle line:84%
If there's no momentum
here, then this

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:14.810 align:middle line:90%
will commute with this one.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:16.935 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, no matter if it's in
here, it always commute.

00:17:16.935 --> 00:17:18.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, a very good question.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I forgot to
mention this point.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.142 align:middle line:90%
Other the questions?

00:17:23.142 --> 00:17:28.560 align:middle line:90%


00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.300 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.760 align:middle line:90%


00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:38.200 align:middle line:90%
So now, the special case--

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.000 align:middle line:84%
we said if you have
time translation--

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.330 align:middle line:90%


00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.540 align:middle line:90%
when you have time translation--

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:54.640 align:middle line:84%
for example, one
example is the--

00:17:54.640 --> 00:18:00.250 align:middle line:84%
yeah, the Hamiltonian
density, H is

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:08.080 align:middle line:84%
equal to pi a partial T phi
a minus L. So the L here--

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:12.910 align:middle line:84%
for the time translation
L is the analog of the k,

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:16.940 align:middle line:84%
and the partial T
phi A is the F here,

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.820 align:middle line:90%
and then here is the pi a.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.415 align:middle line:84%
So here you also
have time derivative.

00:18:21.415 --> 00:18:25.420 align:middle line:90%


00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And so this by
itself is also a pi.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And then L may also
contain time derivative.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle line:90%
So L is the k0 here.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:43.290 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, the k0 is
non-zero, which is equal to L.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And so in this case,
the conserved charge

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:55.850 align:middle line:84%
is just H. So in
this case, you--

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.710 align:middle line:84%
our general argument
here don't apply

00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:59.930 align:middle line:84%
because now, you
have pi here also,

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.480 align:middle line:84%
and you may have a
time derivative here

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.980 align:middle line:84%
also so the story
is more complicated.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.540 align:middle line:84%
But this case, we
know trivially it's

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:14.290 align:middle line:84%
true because it's by definition
H acting on any field.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.100 align:middle line:90%


00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.790 align:middle line:90%
It's minus i partial t phi a.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly
the time translation--

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.745 align:middle line:90%
transformation of fields.

00:19:26.745 --> 00:19:29.450 align:middle line:90%


00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:34.280 align:middle line:84%
So in this special case, this
equation is also satisfied.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:39.540 align:middle line:90%


00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:40.980 align:middle line:90%
Got any questions on this?

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.550 align:middle line:90%


00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:47.777 align:middle line:84%
So this is just follow from
the Heisenberg equation itself.

00:19:47.777 --> 00:19:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And now, you should just
understand this equation.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.950 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.820 align:middle line:84%
S-- so H now can be
considered as a symmetry

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.610 align:middle line:84%
generator for time
translation symmetry,

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:03.830 align:middle line:84%
and when we act on the field and
generate the time translation.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Time translation just
infinitesimally just a time

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.240 align:middle line:90%
derivative on phi.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:13.620 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.700 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:22.020 align:middle line:84%
So these are infinitesimal
transformations,

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:27.090 align:middle line:84%
but now starting from
here, you can actually

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:31.770 align:middle line:84%
obtain finite transformations
on the field also using Q.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:35.340 align:middle line:84%
So you can generate
finite transformations.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:42.490 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So let's consider,
say, U lambda alpha--

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.642 align:middle line:84%
so lambda alpha are
just some parameters.

00:20:49.642 --> 00:20:50.850 align:middle line:90%
Let's consider this quantity.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:54.030 align:middle line:90%


00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Now I exponentiate this
Q. So Q is the operator,

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.340 align:middle line:84%
and lambda is just
some numbers--

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.590 align:middle line:84%
lambda is some
constant parameters.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.180 align:middle line:90%
And again, the alpha is summed.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:06.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.580 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So I understand
how this follows

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:84%
from the Heisenberg equation
of motion, but here,

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.440 align:middle line:84%
how would you evaluate
this commutator

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.130 align:middle line:84%
not knowing the form of L mu
because you said it can depend

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:20.400 align:middle line:90%
on time derivatives as well.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.920 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, here,
just this general argument

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.770 align:middle line:90%
don't apply anymore.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:84%
So in this case,
you really have to--

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:31.260 align:middle line:84%
you can check this explicitly--
you can just write down

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.860 align:middle line:90%
the explicit value--

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:38.340 align:middle line:84%
explicit form of h, and
then work it out explicitly.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.650 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have
to do it because we

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:44.730 align:middle line:84%
know this has to be true
just by self-consistency

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:48.708 align:middle line:84%
because we solved the Heisenberg
equa-- yeah, because when we

00:21:48.708 --> 00:21:51.000 align:middle line:84%
quantize it, essentially, we
are solving the Heisenberg

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:51.500 align:middle line:90%
equation.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:57.740 align:middle line:90%


00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.280 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but you can check
it explicitly yourself

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.150 align:middle line:90%
that this is true.

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:07.140 align:middle line:90%


00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.850 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:15.390 align:middle line:84%
So here-- so lambda alpha
here just some collection

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:23.390 align:middle line:84%
of finite transformation
parameters.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:37.360 align:middle line:90%


00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:42.740 align:middle line:84%
So this can be used to generate
the finite transformations.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:51.000 align:middle line:84%
So if you act-- if
u lambda alpha phi--

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:59.280 align:middle line:84%
phi a and u lambda
alpha dagger, and then

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.750 align:middle line:90%
you just get phi a prime.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And now, this is a
finite transformation--

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:06.920 align:middle line:84%
a finite symmetry
transformation of phi a.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.540 align:middle line:90%
And when you expand--

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.600 align:middle line:84%
with lambda, alpha
is infinitesimal,

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.000 align:middle line:84%
and then you can just
expand this exponential,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.810 align:middle line:84%
then the leading term
becomes this one--

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:21.020 align:middle line:84%
the leading term
becomes this one.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so when lambda alpha
equal to epsilon alpha

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:32.680 align:middle line:84%
goes to 0, and this equation
star, and then star,

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:46.100 align:middle line:84%
star reduces to star as the
leading nontrivial order

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.765 align:middle line:90%
when you expand the exponential.

00:23:47.765 --> 00:23:53.270 align:middle line:90%


00:23:53.270 --> 00:24:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So this can be done
in general just--

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:03.800 align:middle line:90%
so the reason this is true--

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.840 align:middle line:84%
without even doing
any calculation,

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.840 align:middle line:84%
you can just imagine
you can build this U--

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.540 align:middle line:84%
this finite transformation
by infinite number

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.250 align:middle line:84%
of infinitesimal
transformations.

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And the infinite-- so
when you build them up,

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and then you will just generate
the finite transformation.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:26.400 align:middle line:84%
So you already worked out
the example in your pset--

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:32.430 align:middle line:90%


00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.760 align:middle line:84%
so you already worked out the
example in your pset that--

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:51.870 align:middle line:84%
if you can see the Ht minus I P
i x i acting on phi 0 minus i H

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:57.870 align:middle line:90%
t plus i P i x i.

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And then this just
gives you phi t x i--

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:06.110 align:middle line:90%
t x-- just give you phi t x.

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And so this is-- so
here, H t minus P i x i

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:21.560 align:middle line:84%
is our lambda
alpha Q alpha here.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So alpha here runs
0 in i direction.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.320 align:middle line:84%
So in the 0 direction,
the t now is just

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:39.976 align:middle line:84%
some parameter, and the lambda
alpha equal to t and minus x i.

00:25:39.976 --> 00:25:43.370 align:middle line:90%
And then Q alpha just--

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:47.840 align:middle line:84%
and Q alpha here is
equal to-- yeah, t x i.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.840 align:middle line:90%
Let me just do t x i.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And the Q alpha for here
is just H minus P i.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:26:00.950 align:middle line:90%


00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:01.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:12.300 align:middle line:90%


00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:12.840 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.660 align:middle line:84%
So this is just an
example of that.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:18.020 align:middle line:90%
This is just an example of that.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And also you can consider
Lorentz transformation.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:23.477 align:middle line:84%
So another example is a
Lorentz transformation.

00:26:23.477 --> 00:26:27.300 align:middle line:90%


00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:32.440 align:middle line:84%
So let's consider-- so in
your pset, you already--

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.570 align:middle line:84%
so in the Lorentz
transformation,

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:39.550 align:middle line:90%
the conserved charge is--

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.740 align:middle line:90%
actually, there are six of them.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:50.310 align:middle line:90%
M mu nu going from 0 to 3.

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:52.333 align:middle line:84%
So there are all together
six conserved charges

00:26:52.333 --> 00:26:54.000 align:middle line:84%
associated with Lorentz
transformation--

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.600 align:middle line:84%
three rotations
and three boosts.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And then so when you write the
finite transformation, and then

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:05.970 align:middle line:90%
you will have six parameters.

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:10.010 align:middle line:90%


00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:11.960 align:middle line:90%
You have six parameters.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.470 align:middle line:90%
And omega mu mu--

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:19.320 align:middle line:84%
and because mu mu
is antisymmetric,

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.700 align:middle line:84%
which you worked
out in your pset,

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:26.050 align:middle line:84%
so this parameter should
also be antisymmetric.

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:32.065 align:middle line:90%
And so there are finite angles.

00:27:32.065 --> 00:27:37.815 align:middle line:90%


00:27:37.815 --> 00:27:40.880 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sorry, not finite angles--

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:46.810 align:middle line:90%
finite angles and boosts.

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:51.100 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, they
give the parameters

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:54.550 align:middle line:84%
for the finite rotation
angles and the boost.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And so that generates a
Lorentzian transformation.

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:02.380 align:middle line:84%
That generates a
Lorentz transformation.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.980 align:middle line:90%
And so for example, you--

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:13.530 align:middle line:84%
say if you act on u lambda
on phi x, and u lambda--

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:20.900 align:middle line:84%
you can check dagger on phi x--
what you get is phi prime x.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And phi prime x is also the
same as phi lambda 1 on x.

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:33.130 align:middle line:84%
So here, lambda-- so here,
lambda 1 x is the Lorentz

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:49.470 align:middle line:84%
transformation of x mu with
parameter determined by--

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:51.730 align:middle line:90%
yeah, just omega mu nu.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So this capital lambda is
just the corresponding Lorentz

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.335 align:middle line:90%
transformation.

00:28:55.335 --> 00:28:58.070 align:middle line:90%


00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.970 align:middle line:90%
Is this clear?

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:01.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:05.540 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So you assumed
that you can represent,

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:08.570 align:middle line:84%
I guess, the operators that
perform these transformations

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:09.090 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:11.590 align:middle line:84%
But don't you have
to think about

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:14.090 align:middle line:84%
if it follows in
the algebra such

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:16.700 align:middle line:84%
that you can represent it
like this, or like the group

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.650 align:middle line:90%
of transformations?

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:19.730 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, indeed.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.490 align:middle line:90%
So here, it's not--

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:23.330 align:middle line:90%
here, it's not said.

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:24.230 align:middle line:90%
I assume.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Here, I'm just directly
telling you the result.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.180 align:middle line:90%
Just when you build--

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:36.760 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so if you want
to generate the--

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.510 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I'm just directly--
already directly

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:39.507 align:middle line:90%
telling you the answer.

00:29:39.507 --> 00:29:41.090 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So it's
the composition of--

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:42.320 align:middle line:90%
infinitesmal transformation?

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.112 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:29:43.112 --> 00:29:46.790 align:middle line:84%
If you do the composition of the
infinitesimal transformation,

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:48.530 align:middle line:90%
you will get that.

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:51.527 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the reason I write
down this explicitly--

00:29:51.527 --> 00:29:53.360 align:middle line:84%
immediately, because
you should have already

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.430 align:middle line:84%
seen this in quantum
mechanics because that's

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:57.325 align:middle line:90%
how you do the angular momentum.

00:29:57.325 --> 00:29:58.700 align:middle line:84%
In quantum mechanics,
when you do

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.980 align:middle line:90%
the angular momentum, the way--

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.030 align:middle line:90%
it's the same thing.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, here, we just generalize
it to general symmetries.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:10.130 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:14.070 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So it was some similar
question, but just like--

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:15.640 align:middle line:84%
so this is like a
general procedure

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.640 align:middle line:84%
if you have a symmetry
to get the representation

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.700 align:middle line:84%
on your Hilbert space, just
exponentiate it like this?

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:23.490 align:middle line:84%
But like in QM, we
usually just postulate

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:25.140 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
unitary operator,

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:27.900 align:middle line:84%
and then demand that
the group law holds.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.740 align:middle line:84%
So don't we need to show
that those things gives--

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.960 align:middle line:84%
that this preserves the
group law, or is that not--

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.850 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
this is guaranteed.

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:41.220 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I didn't go into
that, but this is guaranteed.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, that's
how you-- yeah,

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:45.570 align:middle line:84%
this is how you
build the algebra,

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:47.520 align:middle line:90%
because the algebra is also--

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.490 align:middle line:84%
the finite
transformation is also

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:53.520 align:middle line:84%
built up by infinitesimal
transformations.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.950 align:middle line:90%
And so essentially guaranteed--

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:59.280 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so there is
a theory of groups

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.340 align:middle line:90%
and the algebra behind this.

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I didn't go into that.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.810 align:middle line:84%
So some of you may
already seen a little bit

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:08.640 align:middle line:84%
of this when you talk
about angular momentum.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:11.870 align:middle line:84%
So in quantum mechanics, so it's
exactly the same story there.

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:13.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:15.410 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So I know that
rotations correspond

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:17.960 align:middle line:84%
to angular momentum
being conserved,

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.270 align:middle line:84%
but what is the intuition
for the thing that's

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:22.580 align:middle line:90%
preserved in boosts?

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:25.250 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's a--

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:29.480 align:middle line:84%
yeah, indeed, there's
no very intuitive way

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.230 align:middle line:90%
to think about it.

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:32.750 align:middle line:90%
Also it's not that useful.

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:34.640 align:middle line:90%
You can define a boost charge.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you consider all
the spatial components,

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:41.810 align:middle line:84%
and if you consider
all the edge here,

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:43.980 align:middle line:84%
then these are the
angular momentum operator,

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and this is your
standard angular momentum

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:47.510 align:middle line:90%
operator, which you have seen.

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at 0
i, and then that's what

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.430 align:middle line:90%
sometimes we call boost charge.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:54.350 align:middle line:90%
It generates the boost.

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:59.300 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of the
conserved number,

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:04.377 align:middle line:84%
we don't use it in the essential
way-- say, in other contexts.

00:32:04.377 --> 00:32:05.210 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:05.870 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yes?

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:07.328 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: But to
that question, you

00:32:07.328 --> 00:32:09.500 align:middle line:84%
can think of it like a
center-of-mass velocity

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.060 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE].

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:12.440 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
it just does not

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.620 align:middle line:90%
give you something additional.

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:18.928 align:middle line:84%
Just normally, when you deal
with physical problems-- say

00:32:18.928 --> 00:32:20.720 align:middle line:84%
angular momentum,
conservation of momentum,

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:21.800 align:middle line:84%
conservation of
energy, conservation--

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.633 align:middle line:90%
it's already enough.

00:32:22.633 --> 00:32:25.412 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:25.412 --> 00:32:26.870 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
you normally don't

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:29.180 align:middle line:84%
need to use a boost
charge conservation

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:30.590 align:middle line:90%
to solve your problem.

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that's why we don't
see this object very often, say

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:39.220 align:middle line:84%
when you discuss special
relativity or other things.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:43.820 align:middle line:84%
But here, it plays a
very important role

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.770 align:middle line:84%
that in quantum
field theory, this

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:50.990 align:middle line:84%
is the operator which
generates the boost symmetry.

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:56.270 align:middle line:84%
If you want to do a boost
in your Hilbert space,

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:57.930 align:middle line:90%
that's the operator to do it.

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:01.060 align:middle line:90%


00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:02.050 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:10.180 align:middle line:90%


00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:11.670 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:13.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so in your pset--

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.960 align:middle line:90%


00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.580 align:middle line:84%
yeah, another example
is the phase rotation.

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Let me just very
quickly write here.

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:25.362 align:middle line:84%
And so another example
is the phase rotation

00:33:25.362 --> 00:33:26.820 align:middle line:84%
if you have a
complex scalar field.

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:48.962 align:middle line:90%


00:33:48.962 --> 00:33:51.295 align:middle line:84%
So there, we show there's a
Noether charge corresponding

00:33:51.295 --> 00:33:54.970 align:middle line:84%
to the phase rotation, there's
a Noether current corresponding

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:57.520 align:middle line:84%
to rotating the
phase to the field.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:58.720 align:middle line:90%
That's a symmetry.

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:05.302 align:middle line:84%
And so that will generate
the charge Q corresponding

00:34:05.302 --> 00:34:06.010 align:middle line:90%
to the first two.

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:08.699 align:middle line:90%
And then if you have alpha Q--

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and then when you act
on phi, and then you

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:15.389 align:middle line:84%
can just check explicitly
that will generate the phase

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:16.469 align:middle line:90%
rotation in phi.

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:22.580 align:middle line:90%


00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're generating
phase rotation phi.

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:39.960 align:middle line:90%


00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:40.994 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:34:40.994 --> 00:34:46.504 align:middle line:90%


00:34:46.504 --> 00:34:47.004 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:34:47.004 --> 00:34:56.820 align:middle line:90%


00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:06.025 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so let's conclude our
discussion of the real scalar

00:35:06.025 --> 00:35:06.525 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:35:06.525 --> 00:35:09.740 align:middle line:90%


00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:12.005 align:middle line:84%
And now, we can
move to a new part.

00:35:12.005 --> 00:35:15.180 align:middle line:90%


00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:18.650 align:middle line:84%
So before we move to new
part, your last chance

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:20.060 align:middle line:84%
to ask questions
about this part.

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:25.850 align:middle line:90%


00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:28.940 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:33.395 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's very
quickly talk about--

00:35:33.395 --> 00:35:51.500 align:middle line:90%


00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.365 align:middle line:84%
so let's very quickly talk
about complex scalar field.

00:35:54.365 --> 00:36:11.200 align:middle line:90%


00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
complex scalar field,

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.090 align:middle line:90%
we get something new.

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:19.207 align:middle line:84%
We get the concept
of antiparticle.

00:36:19.207 --> 00:36:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's consider the
following Lagrangian density.

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:25.340 align:middle line:90%


00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Again, we only consider
the quadratic--

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:34.736 align:middle line:84%
the simplest-- only quadratic
Lagrangian, but now the phi

00:36:34.736 --> 00:36:35.236 align:middle line:90%
is complex.

00:36:35.236 --> 00:36:44.336 align:middle line:90%


00:36:44.336 --> 00:36:45.470 align:middle line:90%
Phi is complex.

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:50.840 align:middle line:90%


00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:55.205 align:middle line:84%
So complex is also
the same as 2 real.

00:36:55.205 --> 00:36:59.350 align:middle line:90%


00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:04.880 align:middle line:84%
So you can decompose
phi into its real part

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.930 align:middle line:90%
and imaginary part.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you plug them
in here, and then

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:13.220 align:middle line:84%
you find you just get
two separate pieces,

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:16.880 align:middle line:84%
and one is the real scalar
field for the real part

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:21.410 align:middle line:84%
and the one is the free scalar
field for the imaginary part,

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:24.612 align:middle line:84%
because each one-- yeah, if you
write phi equal to a plus ib,

00:37:24.612 --> 00:37:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and here, it just become
a squared plus b squared,

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:30.740 align:middle line:84%
here, it's also
a plus b squared.

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:33.090 align:middle line:90%
But there's a reason we write--

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:35.420 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so essentially,
we just get two copies

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.880 align:middle line:90%
of our previous theory.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.310 align:middle line:84%
We just get two copies
of previous theory.

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:41.813 align:middle line:84%
So you say, oh,
then it's trivial.

00:37:41.813 --> 00:37:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Why should we just
consider this-- we just get

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:46.010 align:middle line:90%
two copies of previous theory?

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:50.535 align:middle line:84%
But this advantage-- but
there's some concept--

00:37:50.535 --> 00:37:55.145 align:middle line:84%
there's something conceptually
new when we write in this form.

00:37:55.145 --> 00:37:56.770 align:middle line:84%
there's advantage to
write in this form

00:37:56.770 --> 00:38:01.180 align:middle line:84%
rather than write as two
separate identical scalar

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.680 align:middle line:90%
field theory.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.360 align:middle line:90%
It's precisely in this form--

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:08.270 align:middle line:90%


00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:12.500 align:middle line:90%
this phase symmetry is manifest.

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.530 align:middle line:84%
If I just write it as
two separate real scalar

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:19.940 align:middle line:84%
field, then this phase
symmetry is not manifest.

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And so here, in
this form, there's

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.140 align:middle line:90%
a phase symmetry manifest.

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:28.910 align:middle line:84%
So phi goes to
exponential i alpha phi.

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And so you see this-- you
immediately see that symmetry.

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:35.000 align:middle line:84%
So this-- when you
write it in terms

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000 align:middle line:84%
of real and imaginary
part, this corresponding

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.970 align:middle line:84%
to a rotation between the
real and imaginary part.

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:47.660 align:middle line:90%
And yeah-- good?

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And the equation of
motion is the same

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:51.590 align:middle line:90%
because it's just the--

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:54.770 align:middle line:90%


00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:57.150 align:middle line:84%
because you can easily find
the equation of motion.

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.740 align:middle line:90%
It's the same.

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:00.350 align:middle line:90%


00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, because just two
copies of your previous theory.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the equation of
motion should be the same.

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:12.480 align:middle line:90%
And the Lagrangian density--

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:17.110 align:middle line:84%
the momentum
density for phi then

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:24.930 align:middle line:84%
becomes partial 0 phi star,
and the partial phi star

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:27.040 align:middle line:90%
becomes partial 0 phi.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.250 align:middle line:84%
So we treat-- we can
treat phi and the phi star

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:32.680 align:middle line:90%
as two independent fields.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And then the
canonical momentum--

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:38.470 align:middle line:84%
say if you take derivative
with partial 0 phi,

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:42.040 align:middle line:84%
then you get the partial
0 phi star and vice versa.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:45.850 align:middle line:84%
So the complex conjugate
momentum like that.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:50.580 align:middle line:90%


00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:52.170 align:middle line:84%
So we can now
write down-- again,

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:56.870 align:middle line:84%
we can just write down the
most general solutions.

00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:59.160 align:middle line:84%
So the basis of
solutions is the same.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:02.100 align:middle line:90%


00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:10.950 align:middle line:90%
Same set of solutions as before.

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:27.640 align:middle line:84%
We just have u k x equal to
minus i omega k t plus i k x,

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:33.380 align:middle line:90%
and then you have u k x star.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:37.257 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the same equation,
so the basis of the equation,

00:40:37.257 --> 00:40:38.840 align:middle line:84%
of course, is also
the same as before.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:39.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:43.900 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So if the field
is an operator, doesn't it--

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:48.010 align:middle line:84%
if it's an observable, doesn't
it have to be Hermitian?

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:50.110 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: No, the fields--

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:51.550 align:middle line:90%
it depends.

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:58.060 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, indeed if it's
something directly observable,

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:02.530 align:middle line:84%
it has to be Hermitian, but
that can have two observables.

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:05.860 align:middle line:84%
For example, I can combine
them into a real variable.

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just not
necessarily the phi

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:09.340 align:middle line:84%
itself have to be
directly observable.

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.105 align:middle line:90%
It's just a field.

00:41:10.105 --> 00:41:13.340 align:middle line:90%


00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the field itself
don't have to always

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:16.700 align:middle line:90%
be observable by itself.

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.243 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So then the conjugate
momentum also is not--

00:41:19.243 --> 00:41:19.910 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:21.890 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: The momentum is
not our three momentum?

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:23.640 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, this
is not the momentum.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.220 align:middle line:84%
This is just the
canonical momentum

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:29.490 align:middle line:90%
for the canonical quantization.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this is not the
spacetime momentum.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.080 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Then is the
adjoint of the field operator

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.450 align:middle line:90%
the same thing as the star?

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:39.150 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, here, we
are talking about the--

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:41.370 align:middle line:84%
here, we are talking about
the classical theory.

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
go to the quantum,

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:46.315 align:middle line:84%
indeed, we will replace
the star by dagger.

00:41:46.315 --> 00:41:52.610 align:middle line:90%


00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:55.370 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can just write down
the most general solutions

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:56.165 align:middle line:90%
to this equation.

00:41:56.165 --> 00:41:58.108 align:middle line:90%


00:41:58.108 --> 00:42:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think we can just write
down the most general solution

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:02.570 align:middle line:90%
to this equation.

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:08.730 align:middle line:84%
So we just-- so there's
one slight difference

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:12.700 align:middle line:84%
from before-- almost the
same-- identical as before

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:14.700 align:middle line:90%
except with one difference.

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:26.220 align:middle line:90%


00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:31.530 align:middle line:84%
u k-- but here, previously,
we have a k dagger.

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:33.300 align:middle line:84%
We have a k star,
say, classically.

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Let me just first
write classically.

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:38.220 align:middle line:90%
So previously, we have this.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Previously, why we
have a k star here

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:41.955 align:middle line:84%
when we have a
real scalar field?

00:42:41.955 --> 00:42:47.800 align:middle line:90%


00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.060 align:middle line:84%
It's because the
field has to be real,

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and then we have always add
to its complex conjugate.

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:57.670 align:middle line:84%
But now, the difference is
that now phi is a complex,

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:59.120 align:middle line:90%
and the phi is complex.

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And then we no longer
have the real condition.

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:06.460 align:middle line:84%
That means here, I can choose
another arbitrary constant

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:07.810 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
arbitrary constant.

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:12.160 align:middle line:84%
So by convention, let
me just put a star here.

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:12.980 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.460 align:middle line:90%
It's just the name you call it.

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:19.090 align:middle line:84%
So now, the most
general solution--

00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:20.460 align:middle line:90%
now, you have two sets.

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:22.650 align:middle line:84%
You have a, which
is complex number.

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Then you have another
complex number, which is b.

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have two sets
of complex numbers.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And it makes sense because when
you have a complex variable,

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:34.790 align:middle line:84%
you double the
degrees of freedom,

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and your integration
constant also doubled.

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:39.750 align:middle line:90%


00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:45.070 align:middle line:90%
So b k independent of a.

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:49.910 align:middle line:90%


00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:54.140 align:middle line:84%
So now, you have two
sets of variables.

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:56.840 align:middle line:84%
So you can get the phi
star just by taking

00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:59.630 align:middle line:90%
the complex conjugate of it--

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:02.510 align:middle line:84%
just by taking the
complex conjugate of it.

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And then the full set of
integration constant just--

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.520 align:middle line:90%
you have a k--

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:29.340 align:middle line:84%
you have a k star, you have
b k, and you have b k star.

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:30.645 align:middle line:90%
So this is the classical story.

00:44:30.645 --> 00:44:34.010 align:middle line:90%


00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:40.550 align:middle line:84%
So now, for quantum, we just
do exactly as we did before.

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:44.570 align:middle line:84%
You just promoted all those
into operating equations.

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:49.160 align:middle line:84%
So the-- so you just
call this dagger.

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:52.970 align:middle line:84%
Just call this dag-- just view
every one of them as operators.

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And now, this just becomes
constant operators.

00:44:56.140 --> 00:45:00.500 align:middle line:90%


00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And now, here, you also
just call them to be dagger.

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:15.620 align:middle line:90%


00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:17.475 align:middle line:90%
And the-- yeah.

00:45:17.475 --> 00:45:24.990 align:middle line:90%


00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:28.050 align:middle line:90%
So now, equal time commutation--

00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:35.210 align:middle line:84%
still, we have to impose
the equal time commutation

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:35.710 align:middle line:90%
relation.

00:45:35.710 --> 00:46:06.100 align:middle line:90%


00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:07.960 align:middle line:84%
So now, we have to
impose the equal time

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:13.010 align:middle line:90%
commutation relations again.

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:15.350 align:middle line:90%
So this all should be simple.

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:18.770 align:middle line:84%
So we should have
phi, phi dagger.

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:21.285 align:middle line:84%
They can be-- they're considered
as independent operators,

00:46:21.285 --> 00:46:22.910 align:middle line:84%
so they should commute
with each other.

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:26.150 align:middle line:84%
They're all field variables,
and the phi actually

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:28.260 align:middle line:90%
commutes with itself.

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.100 align:middle line:84%
So this is all evaluated at
different spatial-- yeah,

00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:34.730 align:middle line:84%
just to save time, I will
not write this expression,

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:38.330 align:middle line:84%
but all this should be
evaluated at the same time

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:56.830 align:middle line:84%
by different spatial locations
such as all these equal to 0.

00:46:56.830 --> 00:46:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Except the only thing
which is non-zero

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:03.445 align:middle line:84%
is the phi with its
own canonical momentum.

00:47:03.445 --> 00:47:07.440 align:middle line:90%


00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:08.880 align:middle line:90%
So everything else will be 0.

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:14.835 align:middle line:84%
The only thing non-zero is phi,
which is canonical momentum.

00:47:14.835 --> 00:47:18.510 align:middle line:90%


00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Again, it should be given by
i delta 3 x minus x prime.

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And then the similar
thing for the phi dagger.

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:34.420 align:middle line:90%


00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:36.910 align:middle line:90%
So again, I save effort.

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:40.305 align:middle line:90%


00:47:40.305 --> 00:47:41.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
you should impose.

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:44.480 align:middle line:90%


00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you plug
those things in,

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:51.080 align:middle line:84%
then you can find the
commutation relation

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:52.625 align:middle line:90%
between a and a dagger.

00:47:52.625 --> 00:47:57.140 align:middle line:90%


00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Again, you find-- and
similarly, with b,

00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:12.500 align:middle line:90%
you just get two sides of--

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:15.920 align:middle line:84%
two infinite family of
harmonic oscillators.

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Previously, we have one family,
and now you get two families,

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:22.985 align:middle line:84%
and all other
commutators vanish.

00:48:22.985 --> 00:48:28.270 align:middle line:90%


00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:29.530 align:middle line:90%
So this part is boring.

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:34.930 align:middle line:84%
You can almost guess everything
without doing any calculations.

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:40.053 align:middle line:90%


00:48:40.053 --> 00:48:41.470 align:middle line:84%
You essentially
guessed everything

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:43.168 align:middle line:90%
without doing any calculation.

00:48:43.168 --> 00:48:46.920 align:middle line:90%


00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:48.950 align:middle line:84%
So now, again, you can
write the Hamiltonian

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:51.080 align:middle line:90%
in terms of a k and b k.

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Just will be as you
would guess them to be.

00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Just the harmonic
oscillator corresponding

00:48:57.830 --> 00:49:00.110 align:middle line:84%
to a k, harmonic oscillator
corresponding to b k.

00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:03.800 align:middle line:90%


00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And then the ground
state-- again,

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:12.250 align:middle line:84%
it's the state annihilated
by both of them.

00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:15.700 align:middle line:90%


00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:16.975 align:middle line:90%
So this is the vacuum state.

00:49:16.975 --> 00:49:20.420 align:middle line:90%


00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And now, you can
act a k dagger on 0

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:30.090 align:middle line:90%
and b k dagger on 0, et cetera.

00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:33.290 align:middle line:90%


00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So now, we have two
kinds of particles.

00:49:35.540 --> 00:50:11.850 align:middle line:90%


00:50:11.850 --> 00:50:34.560 align:middle line:84%
So now, we have two kinds of
particles generated by a k

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:40.230 align:middle line:90%
dagger and b k dagger now.

00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So now you have two kinds
of particles respectively,

00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:53.310 align:middle line:84%
and both of them have
the on-shell condition.

00:50:53.310 --> 00:51:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Both particles
have the same mass.

00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:06.450 align:middle line:84%
They satisfy the P squared
equal to m squared --

00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:08.130 align:middle line:90%
minus m squared.

00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:10.380 align:middle line:84%
So because they all come
from the same equation.

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:17.870 align:middle line:90%


00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:21.470 align:middle line:84%
So now, the question is,
how do we tell them apart?

00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have two
types of particles.

00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:30.420 align:middle line:84%
They have the same
mass, and we--

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:34.727 align:middle line:84%
yeah, just by definition,
they don't have any--

00:51:34.727 --> 00:51:35.560 align:middle line:90%
they have same mass.

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:37.690 align:middle line:84%
They also have the same
spin because they're

00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:39.400 align:middle line:90%
all spin 0 scalar particles.

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:42.750 align:middle line:90%
There's no directions.

00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, the question is,
how do we tell them apart?

00:51:47.070 --> 00:52:04.950 align:middle line:90%


00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:07.425 align:middle line:84%
So here is this U(1)
symmetry becomes useful.

00:52:07.425 --> 00:52:10.190 align:middle line:90%


00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Here is this U(1)
symmetry becomes useful.

00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:21.490 align:middle line:84%
So this U(1) so this phase
rotation is a symmetry.

00:52:21.490 --> 00:52:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And mathematically, this is
called the U(1) transformation.

00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:29.680 align:middle line:84%
So this is normally
called U(1) symmetry.

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:35.710 align:middle line:84%
U(1) is just a mathematical
term for phase rotation--

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:37.690 align:middle line:84%
mathematically,
it's a U(1) group.

00:52:37.690 --> 00:52:39.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a mathematical term for--

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:45.450 align:middle line:90%


00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:50.670 align:middle line:84%
so the way we take them apart is
by looking at their conserved--

00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:52.320 align:middle line:90%
look at their quantum numbers.

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:55.260 align:middle line:84%
If we look at two particles,
then how do we tell them apart?

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:57.640 align:middle line:84%
We look at their
quantum numbers.

00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And they're quantum
numbers, so far,

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:03.000 align:middle line:84%
they look almost the same
because their mass is the same.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And by definition, they
are scalar particles,

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.545 align:middle line:90%
and so they have 0--

00:53:06.545 --> 00:53:09.960 align:middle line:84%
they're spin 0--
they don't have spin.

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:12.552 align:middle line:84%
And so the only other
conserved number--

00:53:12.552 --> 00:53:14.510 align:middle line:84%
yeah, if you want to talk
about quantum number,

00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:17.210 align:middle line:84%
their quantum number
has got to be conserved,

00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:19.160 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise, if
it changes with time,

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:22.400 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter-- it doesn't
make sense to use that number

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:23.930 align:middle line:90%
to label a particle.

00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:26.960 align:middle line:84%
But we get one more conserved
number corresponding

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:30.350 align:middle line:90%
to this symmetry.

00:53:30.350 --> 00:53:32.730 align:middle line:90%
So this U(1) symmetry--

00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:37.920 align:middle line:84%
so Noether's theorem-- yeah,
from the Noether's theorem,

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.480 align:middle line:90%
so this is U(1) symmetry--

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:43.470 align:middle line:90%


00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:46.240 align:middle line:84%
then tell us there's
a conserved charge.

00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:48.740 align:middle line:90%
So if you work it out--

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:50.230 align:middle line:84%
you work out the
loss theorem, then

00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:53.170 align:middle line:84%
you find the corresponding
conserved charge, which you

00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:55.180 align:middle line:90%
should have already worked out.

00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So let me just write
it classically.

00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:02.745 align:middle line:84%
So I just write
them as phi star.

00:54:02.745 --> 00:54:04.620 align:middle line:84%
So classically, they
have the following form.

00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:11.580 align:middle line:90%


00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:16.160 align:middle line:84%
So at the quantum level,
this becomes operators.

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:19.890 align:middle line:90%
But here, there's an operator--

00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:22.580 align:middle line:84%
but now, here,
there's an operator

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:26.270 align:middle line:84%
of-- when we go to
the quantum level,

00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:30.110 align:middle line:84%
now there's an operator
ordering ambiguity now.

00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:37.460 align:middle line:84%
You see, here, the phi don't
commute with its own conjugate

00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:39.830 align:middle line:90%
momentum.

00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And so here, we
have phi multiply

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:43.770 align:middle line:90%
its conjugate momentum.

00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And if we change
the order, and then

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:49.070 align:middle line:90%
we will result a delta function.

00:54:49.070 --> 00:54:53.050 align:middle line:90%


00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:56.882 align:middle line:84%
And that will give
rise to infinite nu--

00:54:56.882 --> 00:54:57.382 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:54:57.382 --> 00:55:00.300 align:middle line:90%


00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:07.560 align:middle line:84%
So at the quantum level,
different ordering--

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:15.740 align:middle line:90%


00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:26.155 align:middle line:84%
differ by some
infinite constant.

00:55:26.155 --> 00:55:30.940 align:middle line:90%


00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:32.955 align:middle line:84%
So you can take
phi, and you can--

00:55:32.955 --> 00:55:34.330 align:middle line:84%
yeah, if you change
the ordering,

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:36.040 align:middle line:90%
then you get a delta function.

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:39.940 align:middle line:84%
But delta function,
again, is evaluated

00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:42.610 align:middle line:84%
because these two is
evaluated at the same x,

00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:45.528 align:middle line:84%
and then you get the delta
function evaluated at the 0.

00:55:45.528 --> 00:55:47.320 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, you
get infinite constants.

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.910 align:middle line:90%


00:55:49.910 --> 00:56:15.840 align:middle line:84%
But we can fix this ambiguity
by requiring your vacuum

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:19.050 align:middle line:84%
state-- your lowest energy
state should have charge

00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:22.970 align:middle line:84%
0, because by definition, when
you're at the lowest energy,

00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:24.170 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing there.

00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:27.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a vacuum.

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:32.780 align:middle line:84%
By requiring the lowest
energy state, have charge 0.

00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So that uniquely fixes
whatever infinite--

00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:40.210 align:middle line:90%
the ordering.

00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So by requiring this
equal to 0, and then you

00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:47.630 align:middle line:90%
can show that the Q--

00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:49.780 align:middle line:90%
so now, you can essentially--

00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:51.265 align:middle line:90%
the Q has the following form.

00:56:51.265 --> 00:56:58.310 align:middle line:90%


00:56:58.310 --> 00:56:59.720 align:middle line:90%
So you can already--

00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:07.040 align:middle line:84%
you may be able to guess the
answer of a k dagger a k, then

00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:11.450 align:middle line:90%
minus b k dagger b k.

00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:13.640 align:middle line:90%
That's what you get.

00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:17.660 align:middle line:84%
So you plug those
expressions in.

00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:20.450 align:middle line:84%
You plug those expressions
at this time derivative.

00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:22.610 align:middle line:90%
Time derivative gives you pi.

00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:24.920 align:middle line:84%
You just plug those
expressions in,

00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and again, you find--
because this is conserved,

00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:30.300 align:middle line:84%
you find all these time
dependents cancel, et cetera.

00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And then you get these
two expressions up

00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:37.650 align:middle line:90%
to some constant.

00:57:37.650 --> 00:57:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And then this condition requires
that that constant must be 0.

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, when you
write in this form.

00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:48.930 align:middle line:84%
You see this annihlates
the Q because the a is

00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:50.730 align:middle line:84%
on the right-hand
side of a dagger.

00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So this automatically
annihilates the vacuum.

00:57:54.570 --> 00:58:01.950 align:middle line:90%


00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:05.330 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, this is
just occupation number

00:58:05.330 --> 00:58:08.210 align:middle line:84%
for a and this occupation
number for b k.

00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:20.050 align:middle line:90%


00:58:20.050 --> 00:58:22.050 align:middle line:90%
So we essentially get Q--

00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:28.930 align:middle line:90%


00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:31.330 align:middle line:84%
essentially, the
occupation number

00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:36.460 align:middle line:84%
for a k and the
occupation number for b k.

00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:40.890 align:middle line:84%
So occupation number,
I just write as N. Yes?

00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:43.290 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I still don't see
how this fixes anything,

00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:47.165 align:middle line:84%
because if you switch them,
you still get the same issue--

00:58:47.165 --> 00:58:47.790 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Huh?

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:49.410 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: For this
line of argument.

00:58:49.410 --> 00:58:52.110 align:middle line:84%
If you permute them, you
still get the infinite cost,

00:58:52.110 --> 00:58:55.920 align:middle line:84%
so I'm confused why this is
considered a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:58.260 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, the
way you permit them,

00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:00.270 align:middle line:84%
then you no longer
violate the vacuum,

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:03.120 align:middle line:90%
so that constant will cancel.

00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:05.510 align:middle line:84%
So only this form
with a is sitting

00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:07.100 align:middle line:84%
on the right-hand
side of a dagger,

00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:09.560 align:middle line:90%
this will violate the vacuum.

00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:10.790 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Right, but--

00:59:10.790 --> 00:59:11.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:14.810 align:middle line:84%
I guess because earlier,
the line of argument

00:59:14.810 --> 00:59:17.370 align:middle line:84%
was, if you permute them, you
would get a delta function,

00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:19.490 align:middle line:84%
because you would get the
same thing here, right?

00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:21.170 align:middle line:84%
If you permit
them, do you also--

00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:23.540 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:26.900 align:middle line:90%
Here, there is ambiguity.

00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Here, I don't know how
I should order them.

00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Whether I should put phi to
the right of pi or put pi

00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.740 align:middle line:90%
to the left--

00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:34.730 align:middle line:90%
to the right of phi.

00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:38.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure how should I do.

00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Here, there's no prescription,
and here, there's

00:59:43.170 --> 00:59:44.070 align:middle line:90%
no prescription.

00:59:44.070 --> 00:59:48.360 align:middle line:84%
But if I impose this
condition, then that fully--

00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:50.880 align:middle line:84%
then that tells you when
I impose this condition,

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:52.305 align:middle line:90%
then Q must be of this form.

00:59:52.305 --> 00:59:55.790 align:middle line:90%


00:59:55.790 --> 00:59:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Of course, when you permute
them, it's the same thing.

00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:01.300 align:middle line:84%
When you permute them, you
don't change the operator.

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:02.680 align:middle line:90%
You don't change the operator.

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but if you do,
say-- let's do this order.

01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:08.590 align:middle line:90%


01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:11.430 align:middle line:84%
If you do this
order, what you get

01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:15.830 align:middle line:84%
is this expression with
an infinite constant.

01:00:15.830 --> 01:00:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And then this condition
tells you somehow

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:22.230 align:middle line:84%
you have to change the order
here so that constant is 0.

01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:24.847 align:middle line:90%


01:00:24.847 --> 01:00:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, when you write
it in this form--

01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:30.390 align:middle line:84%
when you write it in a and b,
and that constant has to be 0.

01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:31.466 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:00:31.466 --> 01:00:34.400 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So does the
ordering ambiguity

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:40.030 align:middle line:84%
have any physical consequences,
because besides just things

01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:43.700 align:middle line:90%
that can be subtracted off?

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:48.770 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's-- yeah,
this is a good question.

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:51.650 align:middle line:90%
Which-- it's hard to say.

01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:55.430 align:middle line:84%
So most of the time,
you can fix them

01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:57.560 align:middle line:90%
by some physical invariant.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.020 align:middle line:84%
By phys-- yeah, as
here, you can fix it

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:02.690 align:middle line:84%
based on physical
requirement, and then you

01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:04.400 align:middle line:84%
don't have to worry
about it anymore.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.580 align:middle line:90%


01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.680 align:middle line:84%
But the ordering
ambiguity requires

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:13.280 align:middle line:84%
you try to find such a
physical requirement.

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because otherwise,
what ordering would you use?

01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:20.442 align:middle line:84%
And the process of finding
that requirement by itself

01:01:20.442 --> 01:01:21.650 align:middle line:90%
is understanding the physics.

01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:25.325 align:middle line:90%


01:01:25.325 --> 01:01:25.825 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:01:25.825 --> 01:01:27.242 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Should
we have done that

01:01:27.242 --> 01:01:29.225 align:middle line:84%
with the-- when you've
got the infinite energy

01:01:29.225 --> 01:01:31.600 align:middle line:84%
in the previous lecture,
because you know how it required

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.350 align:middle line:84%
the ground state to
have 0 energy and then

01:01:33.350 --> 01:01:34.732 align:middle line:90%
get some different ordering.

01:01:34.732 --> 01:01:35.440 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:39.980 align:middle line:84%
No, in that case, we don't
have ordering ambiguity.

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So in that case, because we
just have pi square itself

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:49.960 align:middle line:84%
plus phi squared,
and plus phi squared.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.250 align:middle line:84%
There's no ordering
ambiguity here.

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever you get
is whatever you get.

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you get
infinite constant,

01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:58.572 align:middle line:90%
then you get infinite constant.

01:01:58.572 --> 01:01:59.530 align:middle line:90%
You don't have freedom.

01:01:59.530 --> 01:02:05.040 align:middle line:90%


01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.180 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:06.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:09.840 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So I don't also
see how phi and phi dagger--

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:11.648 align:middle line:90%
it's clear that they commute.

01:02:11.648 --> 01:02:14.190 align:middle line:84%
How do you know that there's no
coupling between the fields--

01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:17.190 align:middle line:84%
or when there is coupling,
how do you represent it in--

01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:19.450 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Oh, this
is a definition.

01:02:19.450 --> 01:02:22.895 align:middle line:90%
You say where this come from?

01:02:22.895 --> 01:02:23.520 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Like, why do we know
for sure that it's 0?

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.610 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, this is
just the definition of--

01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:32.370 align:middle line:90%
this is the same.

01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:35.010 align:middle line:84%
This may have nothing
to do with field theory.

01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Only this equation have
to do with field theory.

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:39.690 align:middle line:84%
This have nothing to
do with field theory.

01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:42.750 align:middle line:84%
This is just quantum mechanics
that different degrees--

01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:46.470 align:middle line:84%
different degrees freedom,
they commute with each other.

01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just x1 commute with
x2 in quantum mechanics.

01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, phi-- here, just
phi and phi dagger just

01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:54.860 align:middle line:90%
is analog of x1 and x2 there.

01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:58.590 align:middle line:90%


01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:00.140 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:01.682 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Can every
operator commutes

01:03:01.682 --> 01:03:03.140 align:middle line:84%
do we still have
quantum mechanics?

01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:05.730 align:middle line:90%


01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:07.590 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, it's
different from that.

01:03:07.590 --> 01:03:11.430 align:middle line:90%
Here, it just means that the--

01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:13.800 align:middle line:84%
here, you should view
them as the variables

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.300 align:middle line:90%
in the configuration space.

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And just the-- in
quantum mechanics,

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:20.608 align:middle line:84%
the variables in
configuration space, they

01:03:20.608 --> 01:03:21.900 align:middle line:90%
always commute with each other.

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:28.040 align:middle line:90%


01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.420 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So now, the key thing is
that here is the minus sign.

01:03:33.890 --> 01:03:41.032 align:middle line:84%
So that means when you look at
the commutator between Q and a,

01:03:41.032 --> 01:03:43.756 align:middle line:90%
you get the a.

01:03:43.756 --> 01:03:48.214 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
commutator a with b k,

01:03:48.214 --> 01:03:52.060 align:middle line:90%
you actually get minus b k.

01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:56.980 align:middle line:84%
You get-- yeah, let me just
do the dagger because this

01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:58.330 align:middle line:90%
is used to create particle.

01:03:58.330 --> 01:04:03.440 align:middle line:90%


01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:08.510 align:middle line:84%
So if you just calculate the
commutator, you just find that.

01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:29.360 align:middle line:84%
So that means if you look at the
states defined by one particle

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:33.200 align:middle line:84%
state corresponding to a and
one particle state corresponding

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:49.580 align:middle line:84%
to b, then both are
eigenvectors of Q,

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:56.480 align:middle line:84%
but here with eigenvalue 1, but
this one is eigenvalue minus 1.

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:58.535 align:middle line:84%
So it means they actually
have opposite charge.

01:04:58.535 --> 01:05:03.540 align:middle line:90%


01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:10.510 align:middle line:90%
So k and-- oh, by the way--

01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:13.500 align:middle line:84%
so let me explain a little
bit of this notation.

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:16.320 align:middle line:84%
This k does not mean
the magnitude of k.

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:22.570 align:middle line:84%
So this k means the--
because normally,

01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:26.550 align:middle line:84%
our convention is
that the four vector--

01:05:26.550 --> 01:05:29.640 align:middle line:84%
say the x mu we always
just write it as x.

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:32.310 align:middle line:90%
The p mu we just write as p.

01:05:32.310 --> 01:05:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So here, you should view
this as a four vector.

01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:36.045 align:middle line:90%
It's a four vector.

01:05:36.045 --> 01:05:39.810 align:middle line:90%


01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:42.690 align:middle line:90%
It just is a shorthand notation.

01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:47.770 align:middle line:84%
So k and the k bar, then
they have opposite charge.

01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:50.330 align:middle line:90%


01:05:50.330 --> 01:06:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Have the same mass, the same
spin 0, but opposite charge.

01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:03.490 align:middle line:90%


01:06:03.490 --> 01:06:07.620 align:middle line:84%
So by using this Q, we can
now distinguish these two

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:08.490 align:middle line:90%
particles.

01:06:08.490 --> 01:06:11.080 align:middle line:90%


01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:14.500 align:middle line:84%
So normally, because
such a particle--

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:17.005 align:middle line:90%
because in this case, which--

01:06:17.005 --> 01:06:20.080 align:middle line:84%
they are-- all quantum numbers
are the same, except they

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:21.970 align:middle line:90%
have opposite charge.

01:06:21.970 --> 01:06:24.580 align:middle line:84%
We call them particle
and antiparticle.

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:25.660 align:middle line:90%
So this we call--

01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:28.670 align:middle line:90%
create a particle.

01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:31.060 align:middle line:84%
So here, we say they
create an antiparticle.

01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:40.130 align:middle line:90%


01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:47.780 align:middle line:84%
So here, let me just make a
remark without proving it.

01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So in relativistic
quantum field theory,

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:55.720 align:middle line:84%
you can show that any
particle has an antiparticle.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.210 align:middle line:84%
In any quantum field-- any
relativistic quantum field

01:06:58.210 --> 01:07:02.600 align:middle line:84%
theory, any particle
has an antiparticle.

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:05.603 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the
real scalar field,

01:07:05.603 --> 01:07:07.020 align:middle line:84%
you say we only
have one particle.

01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:09.010 align:middle line:84%
In that case, the
antiparticle itself.

01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:18.204 align:middle line:90%


01:07:18.204 --> 01:07:19.290 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:07:19.290 --> 01:07:21.810 align:middle line:90%
Do you have any questions?

01:07:21.810 --> 01:07:22.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:25.037 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Can we derive the
fact that Q is considered just

01:07:25.037 --> 01:07:27.330 align:middle line:84%
by the number in the
a and the number of b

01:07:27.330 --> 01:07:29.084 align:middle line:90%
is considered separately?

01:07:29.084 --> 01:07:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm having trouble
seeing why conservation of Q

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:35.120 align:middle line:90%
is a non-trivial statement.

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:37.010 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the
conservation of Q,

01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:39.950 align:middle line:90%
it follows from the symmetry.

01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:42.592 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: But couldn't I just--
like, the number of a particles

01:07:42.592 --> 01:07:44.300 align:middle line:84%
and the number of b
particles are kind of

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:45.150 align:middle line:90%
separately conserved.

01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:46.850 align:middle line:84%
So couldn'te I just write
off that Q was conserved from

01:07:46.850 --> 01:07:47.810 align:middle line:90%
the very beginning?

01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:51.550 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
it's-- no, actually,

01:07:51.550 --> 01:07:54.860 align:middle line:84%
the number of a particle
and number of b particle,

01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:57.650 align:middle line:84%
they're not a
separately conserved.

01:07:57.650 --> 01:08:01.470 align:middle line:84%
They can actually-- in
principle, they can annihilate.

01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, here, in free
they cannot annihilate.

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:08.940 align:middle line:84%
But if I can see the slightly
more complicated theory--

01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:10.980 align:middle line:84%
say, if they are
allowed to interact,

01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:14.490 align:middle line:84%
and then they can actually
annihilate and then disappear.

01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:17.430 align:middle line:90%
And so in that case--

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:19.620 align:middle line:90%
but this formalism still works.

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:22.090 align:middle line:90%
This symmetry is still there.

01:08:22.090 --> 01:08:25.229 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the
symmetry is powerful.

01:08:25.229 --> 01:08:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Also applies to the
case with interactions.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:34.779 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, indeed, what you said
is correct in the free theory.

01:08:34.779 --> 01:08:35.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:38.654 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So does this mean
particles and antiparticles--

01:08:38.654 --> 01:08:40.029 align:middle line:84%
like, the difference
between them

01:08:40.029 --> 01:08:43.390 align:middle line:84%
is conserved, so
they work in pairs?

01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:46.640 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
essentially, their property--

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:48.490 align:middle line:84%
it means their property
almost identical

01:08:48.490 --> 01:08:51.640 align:middle line:84%
except they have
opposite charge.

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:55.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they have essentially--

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:58.870 align:middle line:84%
just like a real world, we
have electron, we have matter,

01:08:58.870 --> 01:09:01.060 align:middle line:90%
we have anti-matter.

01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:04.240 align:middle line:84%
They have essentially
identical properties.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And if the world is
made of anti-matter,

01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:12.430 align:middle line:84%
everything still will
behave the same, and yeah--

01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:14.702 align:middle line:84%
except just the
charge is different.

01:09:14.702 --> 01:09:16.660 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: And the difference
between the number

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:20.710 align:middle line:84%
of antiparticles and
particles is conserved?

01:09:20.710 --> 01:09:22.130 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: It's conserved.

01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:25.434 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's conserved.

01:09:25.434 --> 01:09:26.340 align:middle line:90%
Ryan.

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:29.550 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So I guess this
is the electric charge,

01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:32.069 align:middle line:90%
or is this some other charge?

01:09:32.069 --> 01:09:33.630 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: I think
some other charge.

01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:36.540 align:middle line:84%
So in the case we
will go to when

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:39.850 align:middle line:84%
we talk about electrons--
so electrons involving

01:09:39.850 --> 01:09:41.100 align:middle line:90%
a more complicated formalism.

01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:44.130 align:middle line:84%
We have to introduce
particles with spin.

01:09:44.130 --> 01:09:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And in that case, we also have
electron and anti-electron.

01:09:47.310 --> 01:09:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And in that case, it's--
the story is parallel.

01:09:49.770 --> 01:09:53.107 align:middle line:90%


01:09:53.107 --> 01:09:54.690 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So this
does not necessarily

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:57.730 align:middle line:84%
involve E&M or
things reppelling.

01:09:57.730 --> 01:09:58.470 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: No.

01:09:58.470 --> 01:10:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but this is
the analog of that.

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:06.760 align:middle line:84%
So the charge here, they can
be some other kind of charge.

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:10.620 align:middle line:90%
Does not have to be -- yeah.

01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:12.410 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So how can
you get something

01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:15.650 align:middle line:84%
that's physical that's
conserved from a symmetry that's

01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:16.850 align:middle line:90%
not really physical?

01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Like, this is not like
you can translate in space

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.462 align:middle line:90%
or translate in time.

01:10:21.462 --> 01:10:22.670 align:middle line:90%
This is-- I don't understand.

01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:23.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
to think about it.

01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:26.365 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's why
we call it internal symmetry.

01:10:26.365 --> 01:10:28.860 align:middle line:90%


01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:33.750 align:middle line:84%
So for things that we don't
have good intuition about,

01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:35.610 align:middle line:84%
you just invent the
new name for it--

01:10:35.610 --> 01:10:36.690 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:36.690 --> 01:10:39.150 align:middle line:84%
--and once you get
used to this new name,

01:10:39.150 --> 01:10:42.060 align:middle line:90%
you say, oh, I understand it.

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it is more or
less getting used to it.

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, at first sight,
it's not very intuitive

01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:51.660 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
something you can--

01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:55.500 align:middle line:84%
yeah, from your normal
experiences, et cetera.

01:10:55.500 --> 01:11:00.180 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, this is the--

01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:03.778 align:middle line:84%
but this is-- at the
fundamental level,

01:11:03.778 --> 01:11:05.820 align:middle line:84%
it's not that different
from energy conservation.

01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:09.010 align:middle line:84%
It's just some
symmetry, and then leads

01:11:09.010 --> 01:11:11.350 align:middle line:90%
to some conserved quantities.

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:14.170 align:middle line:90%


01:11:14.170 --> 01:11:14.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:16.867 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: If we have
another conserved charge,

01:11:16.867 --> 01:11:20.386 align:middle line:84%
like Q and now
electric charge and--

01:11:20.386 --> 01:11:24.310 align:middle line:84%
which ones do we call, I guess,
particle/antiparticle pairs?

01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:25.480 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.730 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.

01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:29.760 align:middle line:84%
They can, in principle,
have multiple charges,

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.510 align:middle line:84%
but the particle and
antiparticle, they're

01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:33.720 align:middle line:90%
always opposite.

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, in terms of charges
they're always opposite--

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:38.340 align:middle line:90%
whatever charges you have.

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:40.650 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: What if there's
two different charges

01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:43.240 align:middle line:84%
that each one can have,
like a set of four things?

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:44.670 align:middle line:90%
Is it a different language?

01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:45.810 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I think--

01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:49.510 align:middle line:90%


01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:51.273 align:middle line:90%
yeah, you can have them--

01:11:51.273 --> 01:11:52.690 align:middle line:84%
but for particle
and antiparticle,

01:11:52.690 --> 01:11:54.648 align:middle line:90%
they're always opposite.

01:11:54.648 --> 01:11:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they can have
multiple charges,

01:11:56.190 --> 01:11:57.615 align:middle line:90%
but they're always opposite.

01:11:57.615 --> 01:12:00.230 align:middle line:90%


01:12:00.230 --> 01:12:01.130 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:04.610 align:middle line:90%


01:12:04.610 --> 01:12:06.240 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:12.520 align:middle line:84%
So this concludes our
discussion of the complex field.

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:15.460 align:middle line:90%


01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:17.910 align:middle line:90%
So we have a few minutes--

01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:21.480 align:middle line:90%
then let's do to the next topic.

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:24.460 align:middle line:90%


01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:59.110 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully-- so now,
let's talk about the concept

01:12:59.110 --> 01:13:01.860 align:middle line:90%
called the propagators.

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:05.370 align:middle line:84%
So again, let's recall in
non-relativistic quantum

01:13:05.370 --> 01:13:08.170 align:middle line:90%
mechanics--

01:13:08.170 --> 01:13:12.190 align:middle line:84%
So this position vector
plays a key role.

01:13:12.190 --> 01:13:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
eigenvector of this x,

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:21.670 align:middle line:90%
which is the position operator.

01:13:21.670 --> 01:13:23.350 align:middle line:90%
So again, I will--

01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:26.110 align:middle line:84%
yeah, let me just put
a hat here to emphasize

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:28.450 align:middle line:90%
this is the operator.

01:13:28.450 --> 01:13:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
eigenvector of x.

01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:34.337 align:middle line:84%
And because this
plays a key role--

01:13:34.337 --> 01:13:36.670 align:middle line:84%
because we need to use this
to define the wave function.

01:13:36.670 --> 01:13:40.900 align:middle line:90%


01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And then the amplitude
of the wave function--

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:47.260 align:middle line:84%
the square gives
us the probability

01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:49.740 align:middle line:90%
of a particle at location x.

01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:54.620 align:middle line:90%
So this is a crucial quantity.

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:59.860 align:middle line:84%
So this language--
normally, we talk

01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:02.050 align:middle line:90%
about the Schrodinger picture.

01:14:02.050 --> 01:14:08.050 align:middle line:84%
You start with psi
x at t equal to 0,

01:14:08.050 --> 01:14:10.340 align:middle line:90%
and then you try to find--

01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:10.840 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:14.455 align:middle line:84%
Or let me say, you
start at psi x--

01:14:14.455 --> 01:14:17.140 align:middle line:90%


01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:21.860 align:middle line:84%
say, t prime-- at
some t prime, you

01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:26.060 align:middle line:90%
want to find psi x at some t.

01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:29.420 align:middle line:84%
So this is the question
of quantum mechanics.

01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:31.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you know the wave
function at the initial time

01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:35.060 align:middle line:84%
and you want to find the wave
function at some future time.

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:38.520 align:middle line:90%


01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So now let's imagine we
consider this question--

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Heisenberg picture.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.590 align:middle line:90%


01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:57.420 align:middle line:84%
So in the Schrödinger picture,
there's just one eigenvector--

01:14:57.420 --> 01:14:59.430 align:middle line:84%
yeah, just one set
of eigenvectors

01:14:59.430 --> 01:15:03.170 align:middle line:90%
for x for different eigenvalues.

01:15:03.170 --> 01:15:09.440 align:middle line:84%
But for the Heisenberg picture
now, your position operator

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:12.200 align:middle line:90%
now depends on time.

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:14.690 align:middle line:84%
So the position operator
at different times,

01:15:14.690 --> 01:15:16.610 align:middle line:90%
they are different.

01:15:16.610 --> 01:15:20.110 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you want to talk
about the position eigenvector,

01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:22.480 align:middle line:90%
now you need the label.

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:26.860 align:middle line:84%
So now, the position
eigenvector--

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:29.020 align:middle line:90%
it's a t label.

01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:32.380 align:middle line:84%
This t does not mean that
this vector evolves with time.

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:34.180 align:middle line:90%
It's just this is the label.

01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:36.220 align:middle line:84%
This means that this
is the eigenvector

01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:41.600 align:middle line:90%
of position vector at time t.

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:46.580 align:middle line:90%


01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:49.430 align:middle line:84%
This just tells you this is
the eigenvector at time t.

01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:59.100 align:middle line:90%


01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And now, the question of--
this question of-- this is

01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:05.140 align:middle line:84%
the question of
quantum mechanics--

01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:09.550 align:middle line:84%
then can be reformulated
into a different equation.

01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:18.570 align:middle line:84%
So in this story, the
question of quantum mechanics

01:16:18.570 --> 01:16:20.100 align:middle line:90%
becomes the following--

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:24.630 align:middle line:84%
what is the value
of this object?

01:16:24.630 --> 01:16:29.990 align:middle line:90%


01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you are in
the eigenstate--

01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:38.960 align:middle line:90%
you are the eigenvector--

01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.850 align:middle line:84%
you are in the
position eigenvector--

01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:45.170 align:middle line:84%
you are in the position
eigenstate at time t

01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:47.810 align:middle line:90%
prime with the value x prime.

01:16:47.810 --> 01:16:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And what's the amplitude for you
to go to location x at time t?

01:16:54.250 --> 01:16:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, this does
not involve time evolution.

01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:59.620 align:middle line:84%
This is just--
because one is labeled

01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:03.950 align:middle line:84%
in different eigenvector
at different time.

01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:06.440 align:middle line:84%
So if you know this
object, this is called--

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:17.680 align:middle line:84%
this will be normally
denoted G. G--

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:19.000 align:middle line:90%
this is called the propagator.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.310 align:middle line:90%


01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:25.810 align:middle line:90%
This is called the propagator.

01:17:25.810 --> 01:17:31.930 align:middle line:84%
So if you know the propagator
of a quantum system,

01:17:31.930 --> 01:17:33.920 align:middle line:84%
then you have full
knowledge of that system,

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:36.310 align:middle line:84%
so you already
solved that system.

01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:37.560 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:43.440 align:middle line:84%
Because say let's imagine
we want to find psi t x wave

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:49.410 align:middle line:84%
function at time t,
and then by definition,

01:17:49.410 --> 01:17:50.980 align:middle line:90%
this is given by this.

01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So this is the Heisenberg
picture definition.

01:17:55.190 --> 01:18:00.580 align:middle line:84%
It's the psi overlap with the
position vector at time t.

01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:03.595 align:middle line:84%
And now, this is-- now, we can
insert a complete set of state.

01:18:03.595 --> 01:18:19.933 align:middle line:90%


01:18:19.933 --> 01:18:21.350 align:middle line:84%
I just insert a
complete set here.

01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:24.590 align:middle line:90%
Just this is the identity.

01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:31.450 align:middle line:90%
And then this object is just G.

01:18:31.450 --> 01:18:39.980 align:middle line:84%
So you just get G x t x prime
t prime, then psi t prime x

01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:40.480 align:middle line:90%
prime.

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:43.920 align:middle line:90%


01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:46.150 align:middle line:90%
So if you know--

01:18:46.150 --> 01:18:50.410 align:middle line:84%
so yeah, so this just gave you
the wave function at t prime.

01:18:50.410 --> 01:18:53.010 align:middle line:90%
So now, if you load this--

01:18:53.010 --> 01:18:57.720 align:middle line:84%
given the initial wave function,
if you know the propagator,

01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:59.670 align:middle line:90%
you just need to do an integral.

01:18:59.670 --> 01:19:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Then, you find the
wave function here.

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:04.980 align:middle line:84%
So the full knowledge of your
quantum mechanical system

01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:08.130 align:middle line:84%
essentially is encoded
in this propagator.

01:19:08.130 --> 01:19:11.190 align:middle line:90%


01:19:11.190 --> 01:19:13.320 align:middle line:90%
It's encoded in this propagator.

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:18.210 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, now, we want
to talk about what

01:19:18.210 --> 01:19:21.960 align:middle line:84%
is the analog of this object,
say, in relativistic quantum

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:24.060 align:middle line:90%
field theory?

01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:27.180 align:middle line:84%
In quantum field theory, how
do we define a propagator,

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:32.280 align:middle line:84%
and what is the analog of
the position eigenstate,

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:33.990 align:middle line:90%
say, in quantum field theory?

01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:36.950 align:middle line:90%
And we will discuss next time.

01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:42.000 align:middle line:90%
