00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.710 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: So last
time, we started

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.060 align:middle line:84%
talking about the quantization
of the Dirac theory.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And so, if we start with
the Lagrangian density

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:31.880 align:middle line:84%
of the Dirac theory, then we
can isolate the time dependent--

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.000 align:middle line:84%
the part with only
time directive

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.770 align:middle line:90%
and has the following form.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:47.790 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And then we interpret this as
the canonical momentum for psi.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.350 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.980 align:middle line:90%
And then we have pi psi.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And then this one
we just interpret

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.740 align:middle line:84%
as the Hamiltonian,
Hamiltonian density.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.520 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.583 align:middle line:84%
And then we can just proceed
to quantize the theory.

00:01:16.583 --> 00:01:18.500 align:middle line:84%
When you write down the
canonical quantization

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.920 align:middle line:84%
condition, and
then we expand psi

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:84%
in terms of complete sets
of solutions, et cetera.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And then we recognize if we
do it in the standard way,

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.580 align:middle line:84%
say to impose the
commutator relation,

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.740 align:middle line:84%
and then the
Hamiltonian actually

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.370 align:middle line:90%
is unbounded from below.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.670 align:middle line:84%
So, actually, the total
energy can be as negative as--

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.340 align:middle line:90%
yeah, can be x active--

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.190 align:middle line:84%
yeah, it can be
arbitrarily negative.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And so, that theory
does not make sense.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And, also, if we use the
standard way to quantize it,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.080 align:middle line:84%
we would get a
theory which, when

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.170 align:middle line:84%
you exchange two particles,
which they commute,

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.700 align:middle line:90%
which are symmetric.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And so, that looks like both
a bosonic theory rather than

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.270 align:middle line:90%
a fermionic theory.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.120 align:middle line:90%
And then, there's a simple fix.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.700 align:middle line:84%
So the fix is that
instead of imposing

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.280 align:middle line:90%
the standard quantization--

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.650 align:middle line:84%
standard commutation relation,
we impose the following one.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.070 align:middle line:84%
So we replace everywhere the
commutator by anticommutator.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.880 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So what we do, say, for
the commutation relation,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:51.780 align:middle line:84%
we consider psi alpha px
and then pi beta px prime.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.360 align:middle line:90%


00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:03.750 align:middle line:84%
So the anticommutator is
equal to i delta alpha beta

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.740 align:middle line:90%
and the 3.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.490 align:middle line:90%


00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.810 align:middle line:90%
We impose this condition.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.870 align:middle line:84%
So which is the same if we plug
in this pi just given by i psi

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:23.940 align:middle line:84%
dagger, and then that just
gives you psi alpha px times psi

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:37.136 align:middle line:84%
beta dagger px prime, gives
you delta alpha beta delta 3

00:03:37.136 --> 00:03:38.460 align:middle line:90%
x minus x prime.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:46.320 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.530 align:middle line:84%
So this equation-- so
one thing to notice--

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.540 align:middle line:84%
so the commutator--
the anticommutator

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.300 align:middle line:84%
is symmetric between
these two because the now

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.100 align:middle line:90%
is the plus rather than minus.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.660 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.829 align:middle line:84%
And so, note, so this
commutation relation

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.959 align:middle line:90%
is self-consistent.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:35.650 align:middle line:84%
So if we call this equation one,
so if one is self-consistent at

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.070 align:middle line:90%
x equal to x prime.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you take these two
at the same point-- sorry,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.580 align:middle line:90%
so this should be prime.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you take these two
at the same point, so

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.980 align:middle line:84%
the left-hand side, you
have psi alpha and psi beta.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.830 align:middle line:90%
So you just have psi dagger.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:84%
So the left-hand side is a
positive definite quantity.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.200 align:middle line:90%
You have psi dagger.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And the right-hand side is also
a positive definite quantity.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And you have this delta
function evaluated at 0

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:15.280 align:middle line:90%
even though it's a divergent.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And so, both sides
are positive definite.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:90%


00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that this
is self-consistent,

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.180 align:middle line:84%
if you trace it back,
has to do with the psi--

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.200 align:middle line:84%
this pi is actually
equal to i psi beta.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So if it's equal
to minus i psi--

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.690 align:middle line:84%
so if pi is equal
to i psi dagger.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.510 align:middle line:84%
So if it is equal to minus i
psi dagger, and then, of course,

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.168 align:middle line:84%
you will have a contradiction
because the left-hand side will

00:06:03.168 --> 00:06:04.585 align:middle line:84%
be positive or the
right side sign

00:06:04.585 --> 00:06:07.180 align:middle line:84%
will be negative because
you will change the sign.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And that sign then
trace back to this sign.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason actually
we want to have this sign here.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.080 align:middle line:84%
So the sign here
is for a reason.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Even though, classically,
when you write it down,

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.609 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter what's the--

00:06:22.609 --> 00:06:26.980 align:middle line:84%
yeah-- it was not
important what the sign is.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.480 align:middle line:84%
But quantum mechanically
it's actually important.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.610 align:middle line:90%
So this comes from--

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:41.690 align:middle line:84%
so the-- yeah, so the
sign in L important.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:55.300 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.800 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.900 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

the [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.935 align:middle line:84%
when you replace the commutator
with the anti commutator?

00:07:00.935 --> 00:07:03.532 align:middle line:84%
Is that the generic
feature when we describe

00:07:03.532 --> 00:07:05.630 align:middle line:90%
things in harmonic series?

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:06.767 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:07:06.767 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to mention that.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:08.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to mention that.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.946 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So in
quantum mechanics,

00:07:12.946 --> 00:07:14.700 align:middle line:84%
the fundamental
commutation relation

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.310 align:middle line:84%
tells you that x
and p don't commute.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.195 align:middle line:84%
But in the classical limit,
h bar goes to 0, they do.

00:07:20.195 --> 00:07:20.820 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.000 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: And that's a very
physically intuitive idea.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.770 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Right.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.707 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: But then,
here, h bar goes to 0

00:07:27.707 --> 00:07:29.790 align:middle line:84%
just tells you something
about the anticommutator.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So how do we determine
the classical?

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.240 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.420 align:middle line:84%
So the classical limit,
yeah, we will actually--

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.880 align:middle line:84%
this is a very good question
we will discuss later.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.940 align:middle line:84%
The classical limit,
they become anticommute.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, in the classical
limit, essentially they

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.870 align:middle line:90%
become a anticommute variables.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is crucial when we
later describe path integral.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.730 align:middle line:84%
We will discuss this
in detail later.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:59.745 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:00.245 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:00.245 --> 00:08:02.330 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So can
you say anything

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.810 align:middle line:84%
about the commutation
relation between them,

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:06.988 align:middle line:90%
or can you not impose it?

00:08:06.988 --> 00:08:07.780 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Oh, yeah.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.905 align:middle line:84%
You can talk about the
commutation relation between

00:08:09.905 --> 00:08:13.810 align:middle line:84%
them, just you
cannot impose them.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.786 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: But does it-- do you
get any physical meaning from

00:08:16.786 --> 00:08:20.175 align:middle line:84%
the commutation relation
between two objects, or--

00:08:20.175 --> 00:08:20.800 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.320 align:middle line:90%


00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.330 align:middle line:90%
These are two operators.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.965 align:middle line:84%
You can always consider
whatever quantities about them.

00:08:28.965 --> 00:08:30.340 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: There
isn't a general--

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.100 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, but
there's no general rule.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.110 align:middle line:84%
So the general rule, we
impose for the anticommutator.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.220 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And so, and in the
second step, we just

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:84%
expand the psi in terms
of complete sets of modes.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And so, in the second
step, as we do before,

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.735 align:middle line:84%
we expand the psi x in terms
of complete set of modes.

00:09:05.735 --> 00:09:09.120 align:middle line:90%


00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So we have already worked
out last time, times--

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:30.350 align:middle line:90%
so we have ak, s for the u s.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.770 align:middle line:90%
Then we have expansion ikx.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And then, similarly, with the
complex scalar convention--

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.890 align:middle line:90%
so now let me call this c.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Just last time I used
b, but it's often

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.070 align:middle line:90%
conventional to use c.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.020 align:middle line:90%
And I put the dagger here.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.260 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.440 align:middle line:84%
It's not so important
whether you put dagger here.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.390 align:middle line:90%
So but it's a convention.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:57.200 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is our complete
sets of solutions.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And then we expand psi in
terms of arbitrary coefficients

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.630 align:middle line:90%
in terms of them.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And since psi is
generally complex,

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.920 align:middle line:84%
so these two don't
have to be the same.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.890 align:middle line:84%
So these two, yeah, this
is a complex scalar case.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:21.430 align:middle line:90%
They don't have to be the same.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And so, quantum
mechanically, then a and c,

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.910 align:middle line:90%
they are operators.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.550 align:middle line:90%
A and c, they are operators.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:34.470 align:middle line:84%
So if I call this
equation two, and then

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:40.120 align:middle line:84%
if we plug two into one, then
we can get to the commutators.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.640 align:middle line:90%


00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.690 align:middle line:84%
We can get the anticommutators
between a and c.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:59.316 align:middle line:84%
And so, so we find
that, for example, ak r,

00:10:59.316 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:84%
ak prime s dagger equal to
ckr and ck prime s dagger,

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:28.850 align:middle line:84%
now it's equal to
2 pi cube delta 3

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:34.830 align:middle line:90%
k minus k prime delta rs.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And with all other
anticommutator,

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.100 align:middle line:84%
so emphasize
anticommutators zero.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:12:01.180 align:middle line:90%


00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, so the story
is similar as before,

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:08.240 align:middle line:84%
except you just everywhere
replace the commutator

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.830 align:middle line:90%
by anticommutator.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, the vacuum, we
can still define the vacuum.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:20.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.660 align:middle line:90%
You can still divide--

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.570 align:middle line:84%
later, we will see
that this is justified.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:28.350 align:middle line:84%
So we can still define
the vacuum as annihilated

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:40.850 align:middle line:90%
by ak and ck for any k and s.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:48.490 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:49.600 align:middle line:90%
So we define the vacuum.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.070 align:middle line:84%
The reason this is the
vacuum is because, now,

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:59.240 align:middle line:84%
if you find the
Hamiltonian, so you

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:05.868 align:middle line:84%
can plug this in into your
expression for the Hamiltonian.

00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Because they just expressed
in terms of psi, then

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:11.330 align:middle line:84%
you can just work it out,
just straightforward as we

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.970 align:middle line:84%
did previously for
the scalar field.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:18.695 align:middle line:84%
Just now the algebra is
slightly more complicated

00:13:18.695 --> 00:13:19.445 align:middle line:90%
because you have--

00:13:19.445 --> 00:13:23.130 align:middle line:90%


00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:24.380 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:28.030 align:middle line:90%
So now you get omega k.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:32.410 align:middle line:90%
And then you have s 1, 2.

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And then you have aks dagger
aks plus cks dagger cks,

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.270 align:middle line:90%
then plus some constant.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Just as in the scalar
case, we always

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.870 align:middle line:90%
have some zero point energy.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.700 align:middle line:84%
We always have some
zero point energy.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And so now you see,
if you define--

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.300 align:middle line:84%
so now you see the Hamiltonian
is positive definite.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.900 align:middle line:90%


00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.420 align:middle line:84%
The Hamiltonian is
positive definite.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And because we have
a plus sign here

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:23.970 align:middle line:84%
rather than the minus sign if
we do the commutation relation.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And then, since this is
positive definite, and then

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.420 align:middle line:84%
justify defining
this 0 as the vacuum.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Because this state, indeed,
has the lowest energy

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.580 align:middle line:90%
given by this E0.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.230 align:middle line:90%
And, yeah, E0 as in the bottom--

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:41.340 align:middle line:84%
in the previous scalar
case-- would be divergent.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.300 align:middle line:90%
It would be divergent.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:49.410 align:middle line:90%


00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:55.150 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:55.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.608 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: On that line,
what is the coefficient

00:14:57.608 --> 00:14:58.561 align:middle line:90%
of the exponential?

00:14:58.561 --> 00:14:59.807 align:middle line:90%
It's minus i k x?

00:14:59.807 --> 00:15:00.640 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Oh, right.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:00.970 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:01.593 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:01.593 --> 00:15:02.093 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:15:02.093 --> 00:15:05.550 align:middle line:90%


00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:07.020 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:07.860 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.740 align:middle line:90%


00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:11.980 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So let me make some
comments on this E0.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.030 align:middle line:90%


00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:23.970 align:middle line:90%
So, again, the quantization--

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:27.640 align:middle line:90%


00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:36.190 align:middle line:84%
yeah, again, the quantized
field, as in the scalar case,

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:50.180 align:middle line:84%
essentially consists
of an infinite number

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.920 align:middle line:90%
of harmonic oscillators.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:59.300 align:middle line:84%
So now I need to put the
harmonic oscillator by codes.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Because now these
harmonic oscillators,

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.760 align:middle line:84%
they defined in terms of the
anticommutators rather than

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:05.500 align:middle line:90%
commutators.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:12.800 align:middle line:90%


00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.570 align:middle line:90%
And so, very important feature.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And, normally, we
call them fermionic

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:23.130 align:middle line:84%
for reasons will
be clear very soon.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:26.210 align:middle line:90%
So this is the first note--

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:29.570 align:middle line:84%
for a reason will be
very soon and the--

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:33.590 align:middle line:84%
why we call them
fermionic oscillator.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And so, we have for each
k and the value of the s,

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.090 align:middle line:90%
and you have an oscillator.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
oscillator generated by a

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.055 align:middle line:84%
and also have oscillator
generated by c.

00:16:48.055 --> 00:16:50.970 align:middle line:90%


00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:90%
So each fermionic oscillator--

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:04.030 align:middle line:90%


00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.480 align:middle line:84%
so this is like the
harmonic oscillator.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:20.510 align:middle line:84%
They contribute to E0, to
this ground state energy.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:24.430 align:middle line:84%
So, remember, previously, for
the both-- for the scalar case,

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:28.700 align:middle line:84%
each oscillator
contributes 1/2 omega k.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Remember.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:34.070 align:middle line:84%
So now, in this
case, they contribute

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.900 align:middle line:90%
by minus 1/2 omega k.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.450 align:middle line:90%


00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:43.120 align:middle line:84%
It's actually opposite sign
for the standard harmonic

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:43.620 align:middle line:90%
oscillator.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.440 align:middle line:84%
In the standard harmonic
oscillator, it's 1/2 omega,

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.380 align:middle line:90%
and here it's minus 1/2 omega.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:53.500 align:middle line:90%


00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So let me just also
saying why we call it a--

00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:00.090 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:02.970 align:middle line:84%
so a feature of this
fermionic harmonic oscillator

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:09.365 align:middle line:84%
is that, say, you can act,
you can create a state--

00:18:09.365 --> 00:18:16.440 align:middle line:90%


00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:16.940 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So let me just make
some general remarks.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Say if you have a harmonic
oscillator satisfy--

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:30.540 align:middle line:84%
yeah-- satisfy this kind
of commutation relation.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's just look at
one set of them.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:37.710 align:middle line:90%


00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So one side of them, just take
any side with any choice of k

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.270 align:middle line:84%
and s, and then they
satisfy that relation.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:55.530 align:middle line:84%
So this defines fermionic
harmonic oscillator.

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:59.470 align:middle line:90%


00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And so, interesting
feature of this oscillator

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.590 align:middle line:84%
is that you can only
excite them once.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have a
dagger acting on 0, now

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:22.730 align:middle line:84%
if you have a dagger square
acting on 0, then this is 0.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.220 align:middle line:84%
So the only state you have--
you only have two states.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.430 align:middle line:84%
One is 0 and the
one is a dagger 0.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:34.590 align:middle line:84%
It's because the anticommutator
of a dagger itself is 0.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.350 align:middle line:84%
So this just tells you that a
dagger squared is equal to 0.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And, also, a squared
is equal to 0.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.410 align:middle line:90%
And so, you act twice.

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is precisely
the Pauli principle,

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and the two particle
on the same state,

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.620 align:middle line:90%
and you get identically 0.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So if you act any of k here, a,
k, and s, if they are the same,

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.590 align:middle line:84%
if you act them
twice, you get 0.

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:05.110 align:middle line:84%
So if you have two
particles in the same state,

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:07.450 align:middle line:84%
when k and s is
the same, then it

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:10.010 align:middle line:84%
means that all their quantum
numbers are the same.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is the
Pauli principle.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:24.270 align:middle line:90%


00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.340 align:middle line:90%
So this is the Pauli principle.

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:29.535 align:middle line:84%
So no two particle can
be in the same states.

00:20:29.535 --> 00:20:39.090 align:middle line:90%


00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:59.080 align:middle line:84%
So here, then we conclude that
a dagger, aks and cks dagger,

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.380 align:middle line:90%
they create fermions.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:06.430 align:middle line:90%


00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:09.010 align:middle line:84%
They create particles which
obey the Pauli principle.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:19.295 align:middle line:90%


00:21:19.295 --> 00:21:19.795 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:21:19.795 --> 00:21:31.450 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:32.385 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:21:32.385 --> 00:21:35.400 align:middle line:90%


00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.490 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:39.730 align:middle line:90%
So now we can define--

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:43.300 align:middle line:84%
as before, we can define
single particle states.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:55.945 align:middle line:84%
So the single particle states,
say, you just act them once.

00:21:55.945 --> 00:22:00.750 align:middle line:90%


00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.380 align:middle line:90%
So, again, we define them by--

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.980 align:middle line:84%
with this normalization
as in the scalar case.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:13.055 align:middle line:90%
And then a s aks dagger on 0.

00:22:13.055 --> 00:22:15.730 align:middle line:90%


00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And then we define ks bar
to be the one created by c.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:35.740 align:middle line:90%


00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.660 align:middle line:84%
So as before, in
the scalar case,

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:42.250 align:middle line:84%
we can interpret this
k as the momentum.

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:45.550 align:middle line:84%
You can check explicitly,
as we will describe,

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:50.080 align:middle line:84%
that the k give you the momentum
of the-- yeah, goes back

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.910 align:middle line:90%
into the momentum eigenvalue.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, the s
can be interpreted

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:57.460 align:middle line:90%
as some kind of polarization.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:01.100 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, so this
we call particle.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.930 align:middle line:90%
So we'll call this particle.

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And we will call
this antiparticle.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:18.440 align:middle line:90%


00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And so, each particle
has two polarizations.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:35.040 align:middle line:90%


00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.510 align:middle line:90%
Since s equal to 1, 2.

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.170 align:middle line:90%


00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And they are all satisfied,
and the k square, of course,

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.020 align:middle line:90%
all satisfied minus m squared.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:52.570 align:middle line:90%


00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:53.070 align:middle line:90%
good?

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:53.987 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:23:53.987 --> 00:24:01.980 align:middle line:90%


00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.801 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is s and
s bar different?

00:24:03.801 --> 00:24:04.384 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Hmm?

00:24:04.384 --> 00:24:06.672 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is s and
s bar different?

00:24:06.672 --> 00:24:08.130 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Is s and
s bar different?

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because one is created
by a, and one is created by c.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:14.580 align:middle line:84%
So we just use a bar
to distinguish them.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.420 align:middle line:90%


00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:21.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this one corresponding
to a polarization

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:22.970 align:middle line:90%
of this particle.

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And one bar corresponding
to the polarization

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.210 align:middle line:90%
of the antiparticle.

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:29.400 align:middle line:90%


00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:37.460 align:middle line:90%


00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:45.420 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so you can also
find the Noether charge.

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Say you can find the Noether
charge for translation.

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:00.390 align:middle line:84%
So we already talked
about momentum--

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:02.220 align:middle line:90%
Hamiltonian.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:07.180 align:middle line:84%
You can also find the Noether
charge for spatial translation.

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And then you just find the
P, capital P, is equal to--

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:17.500 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so this is, yeah, you
can just similarly work it out.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So, actually, in your
pset, you will work out

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:24.210 align:middle line:90%
the stress tensor.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:27.000 align:middle line:84%
So you find that
the loss of charge

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.220 align:middle line:84%
for the spatial translation
is given by this.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:33.225 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you plug it
in, and then you get--

00:25:33.225 --> 00:25:43.400 align:middle line:90%


00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.100 align:middle line:84%
and then, again, you
have this a dagger.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, to save the
effort, I just say

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:51.260 align:middle line:84%
you have a dagger,
a and c, dagger c.

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:55.070 align:middle line:84%
So you can see,
immediately, these two will

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:59.120 align:middle line:84%
be a eigenstate,
say, of the momentum

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:03.620 align:middle line:90%
operator with eigenvalue k.

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:04.550 align:middle line:90%
With eigenvalue k.

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:09.380 align:middle line:84%
So that justifies that
these are momentum--

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.840 align:middle line:84%
these are the
momentum eigenstates.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:18.050 align:middle line:90%


00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:30.370 align:middle line:84%
So we can also find we can
also define normalization.

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:33.230 align:middle line:84%
We define the normalization,
yeah, for those--

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:37.320 align:middle line:84%
you can check the
normalization for those state.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.510 align:middle line:90%
So these are the plane wave.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:42.680 align:middle line:90%


00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:47.540 align:middle line:84%
So you can check just by
using commutation relation.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:51.900 align:middle line:90%
And this is given by omega k.

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.270 align:middle line:90%
That's 2 pi cubed.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:27:00.540 align:middle line:90%


00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And, similarly, for
the antiparticle,

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.330 align:middle line:90%
you have the same thing.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:18.990 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:21.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you take the overlap
between the particle

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.640 align:middle line:84%
and the antiparticle,
you always get

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:28.750 align:middle line:84%
the 0, because the commutator
between a and c is always 0.

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:37.130 align:middle line:90%


00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Take k, r, and the k prime.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.145 align:middle line:90%
S bar is always 0.

00:27:43.145 --> 00:27:45.698 align:middle line:90%


00:27:45.698 --> 00:27:47.430 align:middle line:90%
They are always orthogonal.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:57.720 align:middle line:90%


00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.510 align:middle line:84%
So let us make some
further notes here.

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:07.870 align:middle line:90%


00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:18.970 align:middle line:84%
So since we have two components,
since each particle a fermion.

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:22.870 align:middle line:84%
So we already said there
should be a fermion.

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:24.580 align:middle line:90%
And it has two components.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:31.420 align:middle line:90%


00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:34.360 align:middle line:84%
So, again, we guessed they
must be spin 1/2 particle.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:39.640 align:middle line:90%


00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.620 align:middle line:84%
We guess they must
be spin 1/2 particle.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:45.310 align:middle line:90%


00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And so, you can
check explicitly.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so you can guess that
this would be spin 1/2 particle.

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:56.630 align:middle line:90%
But you can check explicitly.

00:28:56.630 --> 00:29:02.590 align:middle line:90%


00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:06.770 align:middle line:90%
Indeed, the eigenvalues are--

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:14.260 align:middle line:84%
so you can construct
angular momentum operator

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:17.420 align:middle line:84%
because this series,
Lorentz invariance,

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.620 align:middle line:84%
so you can construct the
Noether charge associated

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:23.000 align:middle line:90%
with the Lorentz transformation.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And then you can construct
the angular momentum operator.

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.080 align:middle line:90%
And then you check.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, indeed, so you find
that indeed the ks and k bar--

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:52.340 align:middle line:84%
ks bar has eigenvalue
of spin half particles.

00:29:52.340 --> 00:30:00.430 align:middle line:90%


00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:02.470 align:middle line:84%
So this is you can
check explicitly.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:07.660 align:middle line:90%


00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:08.160 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.530 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:11.810 align:middle line:90%
And this will be in your pset.

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:14.360 align:middle line:90%


00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.600 align:middle line:90%
This is in your pset.

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is a little bit
non-trivial calculation.

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:25.860 align:middle line:90%
But it's an instructive one.

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.560 align:middle line:90%
So when you see from your hand--

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.520 align:middle line:84%
you see it with your own eye
and from your own calculation,

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:37.030 align:middle line:84%
that this is spin
1/2 is satisfying.

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:41.200 align:middle line:90%


00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:41.700 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:42.830 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:46.350 align:middle line:90%


00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:49.565 align:middle line:84%
So, more generally,
so we will not

00:30:49.565 --> 00:30:53.570 align:middle line:84%
be able to-- we will not
certainly prove here.

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:57.290 align:middle line:84%
So, more generally,
you can prove

00:30:57.290 --> 00:31:01.130 align:middle line:84%
there exist a so-called
spin statistical theorem.

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:13.870 align:middle line:90%


00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:16.315 align:middle line:90%
So a half integer spin field--

00:31:16.315 --> 00:31:24.950 align:middle line:90%


00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:25.450 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:34.960 align:middle line:84%
So half integer
spin fields can only

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:47.950 align:middle line:84%
be quantized using
anticommutation relations--

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:49.270 align:middle line:90%
anticommutators.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:53.710 align:middle line:90%


00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Not only spin half, say
3/2, 5/2, et cetera.

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:03.580 align:middle line:84%
So Dirac field is
the simplest of them.

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And in the anticommutation
relation, and so obey

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:15.460 align:middle line:84%
this so-called the
Fermi-Dirac statistics.

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:19.360 align:middle line:84%
So they obey the
Pauli principle.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Yes, in statistical
physics, which

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.070 align:middle line:84%
when you exchange
the wave function,

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:27.200 align:middle line:84%
you get the minus sign,
it's called the Fermi-Dirac

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.090 align:middle line:90%
statistics.

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And in contrast, if you have
integer spin, say like a scalar

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:37.760 align:middle line:84%
or like a photon, they
have integer spin,

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.410 align:middle line:90%
a photon have spin one.

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And then you can quantize
them using commutators.

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:55.670 align:middle line:90%


00:32:55.670 --> 00:33:10.040 align:middle line:84%
So for integer spin,
and then quantized--

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.980 align:middle line:84%
can be consistently
quantized using commutators.

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:19.640 align:middle line:90%


00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So, in this case, you get
the Bose-Einstein statistics.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:29.900 align:middle line:90%


00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Means when you exchange the
wave function of the particles,

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.417 align:middle line:90%
the wave function remains--

00:33:34.417 --> 00:33:36.500 align:middle line:84%
when you exchange the
particles, the wave function

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:37.910 align:middle line:90%
remains symmetric.

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:43.040 align:middle line:90%


00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.230 align:middle line:90%
And so, this is very general.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:46.190 align:middle line:90%
This is very general.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:51.560 align:middle line:90%


00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.060 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.200 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:53.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:55.600 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So are there
other relationships

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.227 align:middle line:90%
we use to quantize a field here?

00:33:58.227 --> 00:34:00.590 align:middle line:90%


00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:03.540 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, that's
a very good question.

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:08.070 align:middle line:84%
So in 2 plus 1 dimension, very
special, 2 plus 1 dimension,

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:13.010 align:middle line:84%
so there are more general
statistics than Bose-Einstein--

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:14.690 align:middle line:90%
than bosons and fermions.

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:18.080 align:middle line:84%
There are things in between
called anyons, yeah.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And they play a
very important role

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:23.500 align:middle line:84%
in condensed matter
physics, yeah.

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.360 align:middle line:84%
The anyon, actually, was
proposed by our colleague,

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.929 align:middle line:90%
Frank Wilcock, in early '80s.

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, at the beginning,
it sounded like a fantasy.

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:36.988 align:middle line:84%
But then later actually find
many important applications

00:34:36.988 --> 00:34:38.155 align:middle line:90%
in condensed matter physics.

00:34:38.155 --> 00:34:41.800 align:middle line:90%


00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.927 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:42.927 --> 00:34:44.469 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: What rule
we've seen so far

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:46.511 align:middle line:84%
tells us that we should
interpret the a and the c

00:34:46.511 --> 00:34:49.100 align:middle line:84%
operators as particles
and antiparticles?

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:53.000 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, it's
just convention.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.730 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:59.720 align:middle line:84%
You can-- as far as
they're anti each other.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.850 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I guess, what
indicates they are--

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:03.500 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Good.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:06.643 align:middle line:84%
That's what we are
going to talk about.

00:35:06.643 --> 00:35:07.310 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:07.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.530 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So the
spin 1/2 here comes

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:12.290 align:middle line:84%
from the possible
value of s, which

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:16.590 align:middle line:84%
comes from solving the
classical Dirac equation?

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:21.840 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, so spin
1/2, you can guess it

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.990 align:middle line:90%
from the two components.

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:27.980 align:middle line:84%
But for this one, you can
just work out the eigenvalues.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:29.330 align:middle line:90%
You will see, it's 1/2.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:30.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:32.887 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So when we
generalize it to more--

00:35:32.887 --> 00:35:34.220 align:middle line:90%
like more half spin [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:36.540 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:37.957 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: We have
more components?

00:35:37.957 --> 00:35:40.123 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, you will
have more components, yeah.

00:35:40.123 --> 00:35:41.350 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: And we will be--

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:44.910 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, you will
have more components, yeah.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:48.220 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:48.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.380 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: You say
that the energy

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:53.775 align:middle line:84%
is positive, positive definite
just because you got rid

00:35:53.775 --> 00:35:54.650 align:middle line:90%
of the negative sign.

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:57.470 align:middle line:84%
But how do you know that
these new operators, like c

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:00.030 align:middle line:84%
is going to behave
like you want it to?

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:02.970 align:middle line:84%
I guess, because we
don't know the spectrum.

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:04.726 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: What do you mean?

00:36:04.726 --> 00:36:06.990 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: The eigenvalues
of c [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:08.670 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: No, we know
everything about--

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:11.130 align:middle line:84%
we know everything
about them once I

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:15.580 align:middle line:84%
specifier the anticommutator,
everything is fixed.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Then everything is fixed,
the spectrum is fixed.

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:21.220 align:middle line:84%
The energy spectrum
just follow from here.

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:25.050 align:middle line:84%
So each a or c just can
create the one particle.

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:26.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.770 align:middle line:84%
So the spectrum is completely
fixed, the energy is fixed.

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we know
everything about them.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:34.832 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Can you have a
theory that is spin half

00:36:34.832 --> 00:36:37.020 align:middle line:90%
particles but no antiparticles?

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.790 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Oh, yeah, that's
a very good question.

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's the Holy
Grail of neutrino physics

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:51.280 align:middle line:84%
and also in condensed matter
physics or quantum computation.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So people have been looking for
these Majorana fermions, which

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.290 align:middle line:90%
we will talk about later.

00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And people have been looking for
these Majorana fermions, which

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:00.330 align:middle line:90%
is like a real scalar.

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:02.970 align:middle line:84%
It's the counterpart
of the real scalar.

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:04.647 align:middle line:90%
Here it's more like a complex--

00:37:04.647 --> 00:37:05.355 align:middle line:90%
the counterparts.

00:37:05.355 --> 00:37:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, here is more
like a complex scalar.

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:09.785 align:middle line:84%
But you can actually--
we will talk about it.

00:37:09.785 --> 00:37:11.160 align:middle line:84%
We'll be able to
define something

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:15.420 align:middle line:84%
like a real fermion and
then its own antiparticle.

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:16.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:17.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.903 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Can you
write down something

00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:21.910 align:middle line:84%
that looks analogous to
the Dirac equation for spin

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:22.757 align:middle line:90%
3/2 or 5/2?

00:37:22.757 --> 00:37:24.340 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, you
can write it down.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:25.178 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:25.178 --> 00:37:26.497 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: You can find those?

00:37:26.497 --> 00:37:28.330 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, I think
you can write down--

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:32.930 align:middle line:84%
I think people are by now have
written down equations for any,

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:33.430 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:35.847 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, in principle, you can
write it down for any of them.

00:37:35.847 --> 00:37:38.810 align:middle line:90%


00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, in the end, it boils
down to group theory.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.528 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:43.528 --> 00:37:45.320 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I don't know
if this makes sense.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.310 align:middle line:84%
But the particles that are
excited, the excitations

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:52.660 align:middle line:84%
of this field, will they still
obey the uncertainty relation

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:56.352 align:middle line:84%
given that we've gotten
rid of position momentum

00:37:56.352 --> 00:37:58.760 align:middle line:90%
and commutation relations?

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:06.350 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: So even
in the boson case,

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:09.020 align:middle line:84%
our commutation
relation is not related

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.930 align:middle line:90%
to position and momentum.

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:15.986 align:middle line:84%
There is the field
with its conjugate.

00:38:15.986 --> 00:38:18.500 align:middle line:84%
There's no position
operator anymore.

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:21.918 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: How do you get a
single particle wave function

00:38:21.918 --> 00:38:26.400 align:middle line:84%
from a [INAUDIBLE] a single
particle wave equation?

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.770 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, in the
non-relativistic limit, yeah,

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:30.860 align:middle line:84%
you have to take the
non-relativistic limit.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:31.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:36.760 align:middle line:90%


00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:37.260 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.280 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:41.400 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: In step
two, how do we know

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.380 align:middle line:84%
that all the solutions
that we listed out

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.930 align:middle line:84%
form a complete set
of all the solutions?

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.740 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, because we
have solved the Dirac equation.

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Dirac equation is
a linear equation.

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, you
solved it, then you

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.420 align:middle line:84%
know you have found
all the solutions.

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because we do
a Fourier transform,

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:01.940 align:middle line:84%
convert it into an
algebraic equation.

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:05.640 align:middle line:84%
The algebraic equation we know
when we find all the solutions.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so those things we can
know for full confidence.

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:11.970 align:middle line:90%


00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:13.410 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:18.960 align:middle line:84%
So now let's explain in
what sense we call one of--

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.180 align:middle line:84%
called the particle
and antiparticle,

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.160 align:middle line:84%
in what sense they
are anti each other.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is very similar
to in the boson case

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.010 align:middle line:90%
when you have a complex scalar.

00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And, remember, in the
complex scalar case,

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.450 align:middle line:84%
the reason we call
one particle to be

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:36.525 align:middle line:84%
a particle, the other
to be antiparticle,

00:39:36.525 --> 00:39:42.010 align:middle line:84%
is they have the same mass, the
same spin, spin 0 in that case,

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:44.190 align:middle line:90%
but opposite charge.

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:46.440 align:middle line:84%
So here we can also
define a charge for them.

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:49.590 align:middle line:90%


00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:50.790 align:middle line:90%
Now let's talk about charge.

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:56.580 align:middle line:90%


00:39:56.580 --> 00:40:07.030 align:middle line:84%
So remember, in your
pset, when we first talk

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:10.720 align:middle line:84%
about Dirac equation,
in your pset you derived

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:15.180 align:middle line:84%
that if you treat the Dirac
equation as a wave equation,

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:18.180 align:middle line:84%
then you can derive a
probability current.

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And then, the zeroth
component of that current

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:22.860 align:middle line:90%
is actually positive definite.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:23.550 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:33.420 align:middle line:84%
So there, when we treat
the Dirac equation

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:34.290 align:middle line:90%
as a wave equation.

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:39.150 align:middle line:90%


00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:40.335 align:middle line:90%
And then we find--

00:40:40.335 --> 00:40:43.630 align:middle line:90%


00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:45.760 align:middle line:84%
from what we did with
Schrodinger equation,

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:54.240 align:middle line:84%
similarly from what we did
with the Schrodinger equation,

00:40:54.240 --> 00:41:00.660 align:middle line:84%
and we can derive a
equation like partial mu,

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:01.785 align:middle line:90%
j mu equal to 0.

00:41:01.785 --> 00:41:04.770 align:middle line:90%


00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:06.120 align:middle line:90%
And the j mu--

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.680 align:middle line:90%


00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.030 align:middle line:90%
yeah, so up to a sign.

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:13.240 align:middle line:84%
So let me just choose
a minus sign here.

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.670 align:middle line:90%
So j mu is given by this.

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:17.770 align:middle line:90%
Using our current notation.

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Of course, at the time,
we don't know those.

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:22.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, do we know the bar?

00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:23.320 align:middle line:90%
I forgot.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.930 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, so you have this j.

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:27.010 align:middle line:90%
You can derive this j.

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And the zeroth
component of the j, you

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:34.090 align:middle line:84%
just psi dagger psi,
which is manifestly

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:35.875 align:middle line:84%
positive as a
classical function.

00:41:35.875 --> 00:41:38.620 align:middle line:90%


00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And so, I mentioned that this
was the Dirac's main motivation

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:45.340 align:middle line:84%
for writing down
Dirac equation is

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:48.310 align:middle line:84%
to look for probability
current, which

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:52.240 align:middle line:90%
is the positive probability.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is positive
definite classically.

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:59.410 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, when you treat
it as a wave equation.

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:01.210 align:middle line:90%
So now we are--

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:05.290 align:middle line:84%
but now we don't think Dirac
equation as a wave equation,

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:07.940 align:middle line:90%
we treat it as a field theory.

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:13.330 align:middle line:84%
So as a field theory,
and then Dirac equation--

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:16.105 align:middle line:90%
so we have the action.

00:42:16.105 --> 00:42:24.930 align:middle line:90%


00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:26.790 align:middle line:84%
So this action has
obvious symmetry

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:middle line:84%
similar to the
complex boson case.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:37.650 align:middle line:84%
So this, you can rotate psi by
a phase, by a constant phase.

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Then psi bar goes
to minus alpha psi.

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And so, obviously, this
is the invariant if alpha

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:48.480 align:middle line:90%
is a constant.

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.065 align:middle line:90%
And so, this is a u1 symmetry.

00:42:50.065 --> 00:42:54.740 align:middle line:90%


00:42:54.740 --> 00:43:00.020 align:middle line:84%
So when you have a symmetry
by rotation by a face,

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:02.220 align:middle line:90%
and it's a U1 symmetry.

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And so, from the
Noether theorem,

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:09.200 align:middle line:84%
then there must be a conserved
current corresponding

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.520 align:middle line:90%
to this phase rotation.

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:16.550 align:middle line:90%


00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:20.970 align:middle line:84%
So without doing
any calculation,

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:28.440 align:middle line:84%
you should already be able to
guess that this is the current.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.390 align:middle line:84%
So this now becomes
the Noether current.

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:33.070 align:middle line:90%


00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:38.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually this, if you
find the Noether current, you

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:41.578 align:middle line:90%
just find this one.

00:43:41.578 --> 00:43:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Just find this one.

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:48.700 align:middle line:90%


00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:56.220 align:middle line:84%
So, now, instead,
we interpret J0--

00:43:56.220 --> 00:44:00.540 align:middle line:84%
rather than interpret this as
a probability current and this

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:03.580 align:middle line:84%
as a probability density, if
you treat it as a wave equation.

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And here we just interpret
it as the conserved current

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:08.430 align:middle line:90%
for this U1 symmetry.

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And you have some
conserved current.

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And then, this is corresponding
to the zeroth component

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:16.230 align:middle line:90%
of this conserved current.

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:17.790 align:middle line:90%
And so, this is--

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:23.580 align:middle line:84%
we interpreted as some
kind of charge density

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:27.030 align:middle line:90%
as we did for the scalar case.

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:29.055 align:middle line:84%
Now this is just
interpreted as the--

00:44:29.055 --> 00:44:32.720 align:middle line:90%


00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:38.660 align:middle line:84%
so now, now you can
just work it out,

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:46.100 align:middle line:90%
what's this, and then the Q.

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:56.510 align:middle line:90%


00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:59.240 align:middle line:90%
So the Q defined this way.

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:02.660 align:middle line:84%
So Q is the total
conserved charge,

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:06.110 align:middle line:84%
which is you integrate
j0 over all space.

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:11.940 align:middle line:90%
And then just equal to that.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:17.480 align:middle line:90%


00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.660 align:middle line:84%
So, naively, this is a
positive definite quantity.

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:24.130 align:middle line:90%


00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:37.520 align:middle line:84%
But, actually, now
if you plug in the --

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:43.320 align:middle line:84%
the expression for psi, then
what you find is the following.

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.485 align:middle line:84%
You find the Q have
the following form.

00:45:45.485 --> 00:46:14.380 align:middle line:90%


00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Now minus cks
dagger, cks, and then

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:26.125 align:middle line:90%
plus the infinite constant.

00:46:26.125 --> 00:46:31.110 align:middle line:90%


00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Plus the infinite constant.

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:38.100 align:middle line:90%


00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:43.760 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, so we will define
the Q, the quantum operator Q,

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.600 align:middle line:84%
by forgetting about
this infinite constant.

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:50.400 align:middle line:90%


00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.805 align:middle line:84%
So now you see something
very interesting happens.

00:46:52.805 --> 00:46:57.940 align:middle line:90%


00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:04.000 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, so if we set
this constant, yeah,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.550 align:middle line:90%
they call this--

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:07.860 align:middle line:90%
let me just call this Q0.

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And the Q0 is
infinite, just as you

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:18.450 align:middle line:84%
have a constant energy for
the-- just have E0, which

00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:21.690 align:middle line:84%
is infinite, and here
is also infinite.

00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:27.660 align:middle line:84%
But we will define
the quantum version.

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:32.940 align:middle line:84%
But we can just define the
Q just to include this part.

00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:35.350 align:middle line:90%
And then, by definition--

00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:37.500 align:middle line:84%
so if I define the
Q just by that part,

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:40.770 align:middle line:84%
the Q acting on the
vacuum just give you 0

00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:42.780 align:middle line:84%
because I have c and
a on the other side.

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:44.835 align:middle line:84%
So it means that the
vacuum have 0 charge.

00:47:44.835 --> 00:47:49.090 align:middle line:90%


00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:49.590 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:53.405 align:middle line:84%
But now you see something
interesting happens.

00:47:53.405 --> 00:47:55.280 align:middle line:84%
So do you observe
something interesting here?

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:59.450 align:middle line:90%


00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:01.376 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:01.376 --> 00:48:03.188 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: It should
be [? posted ?] then

00:48:03.188 --> 00:48:05.820 align:middle line:90%
and shown like this.

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:09.460 align:middle line:84%
But here, if we
define [INAUDIBLE]..

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:10.630 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: That's right.

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:12.190 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:16.420 align:middle line:84%
So naively, this
quantity is infinitely--

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:20.730 align:middle line:84%
naively, this quantity
is positive definite.

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:25.050 align:middle line:90%
But if we define it in the way--

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:29.800 align:middle line:84%
but this quantity by
itself is divergent.

00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.620 align:middle line:84%
When we say something
is positive definite,

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:35.980 align:middle line:84%
if it's divergent, then it
does not mean very much.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.200 align:middle line:84%
So now, when we want
to make it finite,

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:41.320 align:middle line:84%
the way we make it
finite is we define this,

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:44.080 align:middle line:84%
so that when you act on
the vacuum, so that it's 0,

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:47.050 align:middle line:90%
so that the vacuum has 0 charge.

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:50.700 align:middle line:84%
So when we throw away
this infinite constant,

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:54.700 align:middle line:84%
and then, actually, this can
be either positive or negative.

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:57.020 align:middle line:84%
This can be either
positive or negative.

00:48:57.020 --> 00:49:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, so this is the
magic by throwing away

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:05.260 align:middle line:84%
some constants, throwing
away infinite constants.

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And you can make a
positive quantity

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:11.270 align:middle line:90%
into an arbitrary sign.

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:13.980 align:middle line:90%
But this is a good thing.

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:18.010 align:middle line:90%
So now, if you look at--

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:24.190 align:middle line:84%
when you act on the
a and c, because

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:30.790 align:middle line:84%
of this sign difference,
when you find that when

00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:39.190 align:middle line:84%
you act on ks, then
you get eigenvalue 1.

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:45.670 align:middle line:84%
When you act on ks bar,
you get eigenvalue minus 1.

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:51.070 align:middle line:90%


00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:52.900 align:middle line:90%
So this has charge 1.

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:56.350 align:middle line:90%
So this has charge minus 1.

00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:59.272 align:middle line:84%
So you see that this particle
and antiparticle, everything

00:49:59.272 --> 00:49:59.980 align:middle line:90%
else is the same.

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:01.540 align:middle line:90%
They have the same mass.

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:03.880 align:middle line:84%
They have the same
spin, spin half,

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:07.910 align:middle line:84%
but they only differ
charge by opposite charge.

00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:11.110 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we call
one of them is particle

00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:14.250 align:middle line:90%
and one of them antiparticle.

00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:14.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:16.250 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Can we
interpret this just

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:17.775 align:middle line:90%
like the probability charge?

00:50:17.775 --> 00:50:18.650 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: No, no, no.

00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:20.990 align:middle line:84%
This is not probability,
this is just charge.

00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:23.450 align:middle line:84%
There's no probability
interpretation anymore.

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Probability is only when you
treat it as a wave function--

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.662 align:middle line:90%
a wave equation.

00:50:29.662 --> 00:50:31.370 align:middle line:84%
But we don't treat it
as a wave equation.

00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:33.000 align:middle line:90%
We treat it as a field theory.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.210 align:middle line:84%
So in the field theory, and
this is just some charge

00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:39.600 align:middle line:90%
particles can carry.

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you have nothing
to do with probability.

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:48.700 align:middle line:90%


00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:49.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:51.580 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is the fact
that Q not is positive

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:53.955 align:middle line:84%
break any symmetry between
particle and antiparticle?

00:50:53.955 --> 00:50:56.070 align:middle line:90%


00:50:56.070 --> 00:50:57.585 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: What do you mean by--

00:50:57.585 --> 00:51:00.630 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So just
right there, Q not

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:02.255 align:middle line:84%
goes to just a
positive infinity.

00:51:02.255 --> 00:51:02.880 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:03.922 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Does it break--

00:51:03.922 --> 00:51:07.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- particles and
antiparticles are not the same?

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:10.440 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, you
always have to--

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.990 align:middle line:84%
because you have to
choose a reference.

00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Because the particle
and antiparticle,

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.760 align:middle line:84%
they create something
out of the vacuum.

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Still, even if you
keep this Q0, so that

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:25.980 align:middle line:84%
means that your vacuum
has a charge, which is Q0.

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And, again, then the particle
will increase the charge by 1

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:33.000 align:middle line:84%
and the antiparticle will
decrease the charge by 1.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.970 align:middle line:90%
So this aspect is the same.

00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:35.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:38.168 align:middle line:84%
So when you act
this on the vacuum,

00:51:38.168 --> 00:51:39.210 align:middle line:90%
you just increase charge.

00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just here,
for convenience,

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:44.685 align:middle line:84%
we choose the vacuum
to have 0 charge.

00:51:44.685 --> 00:51:47.570 align:middle line:90%


00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:49.130 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:52.215 align:middle line:90%
Any other questions?

00:51:52.215 --> 00:51:52.715 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:51:52.715 --> 00:51:54.923 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Does charge have
a physical interpretation,

00:51:54.923 --> 00:51:58.940 align:middle line:84%
or how do I interpret the
charge in this instance?

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:03.120 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, so 1 is the
electron, 1 is the positron.

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so these are the
electric charge we observe.

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:07.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:10.230 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
electron-- so when

00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:middle line:84%
you apply this theory
to the electron,

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:15.405 align:middle line:84%
then this is just the
charge of the electron.

00:52:15.405 --> 00:52:24.040 align:middle line:90%


00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, so this
actually my next remark.

00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:32.880 align:middle line:90%
So applied to electron.

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:36.740 align:middle line:90%


00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:49.490 align:middle line:84%
So Q can be interpreted up
to a sign as the charge--

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:50.660 align:middle line:90%
as the electric charge.

00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:53.210 align:middle line:90%


00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:55.468 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, up to assign and a unit.

00:52:55.468 --> 00:52:57.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is essentially
the electric charge.

00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:59.930 align:middle line:90%


00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:03.480 align:middle line:84%
So we will see later,
this is the charge,

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:06.370 align:middle line:84%
which couples to the
electromagnetism.

00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:06.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:08.453 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So I'm a
little bit confused

00:53:08.453 --> 00:53:10.156 align:middle line:84%
how you can define
the notion of charge

00:53:10.156 --> 00:53:13.003 align:middle line:84%
without even defining the
notion of force or force

00:53:13.003 --> 00:53:14.170 align:middle line:90%
carrier, anything like that.

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:17.200 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, the
concept of charge

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:19.720 align:middle line:90%
is independent of the force.

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:20.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:21.912 align:middle line:84%
Even though sometimes
the force, you're

00:53:21.912 --> 00:53:23.370 align:middle line:84%
used to this concept
with a charge.

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:26.650 align:middle line:84%
But charge by itself is
an independent concept.

00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, when we talk about
the Maxwell theory and then

00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:35.310 align:middle line:84%
couple this thing to the
Maxwell theory and then

00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:37.800 align:middle line:90%
will become clearer.

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but the bottom line
is that the charge by--

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:45.930 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you can define
independent of the force.

00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:48.520 align:middle line:90%
It's just some quantum number.

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:49.318 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:49.318 --> 00:53:50.860 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
how do you get out

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:53.210 align:middle line:90%
a value for what that term is?

00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:55.163 align:middle line:84%
Right now, it's just
one or minus one.

00:53:55.163 --> 00:53:55.830 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Right.

00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so indeed, so
here, there's a unit.

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:05.220 align:middle line:84%
Because you can multiply
that j by arbitrary constant.

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And then, that defines
your unit for your charge.

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And so, in principle,
yeah, so that unit

00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:13.980 align:middle line:84%
have to be determined
by experiments.

00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:23.350 align:middle line:90%


00:54:23.350 --> 00:54:23.850 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:26.530 align:middle line:90%


00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:29.110 align:middle line:90%
So the Dirac equation--

00:54:29.110 --> 00:54:32.900 align:middle line:90%


00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:45.520 align:middle line:84%
so it's very important, is
that Dirac theory predict

00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:49.110 align:middle line:84%
if you say, this is
the theory of electron,

00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:53.370 align:middle line:84%
so predict that electron
has an antiparticle.

00:54:53.370 --> 00:55:03.150 align:middle line:90%


00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:03.900 align:middle line:90%
We call it e-plus.

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:06.870 align:middle line:90%


00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:11.660 align:middle line:84%
So the e-plus have the same mass
spin but just opposite charge

00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:12.410 align:middle line:90%
from the electron.

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:16.180 align:middle line:90%


00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, when Dirac
wrote down this theory,

00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:23.630 align:middle line:90%
there was no e-plus yet.

00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:26.940 align:middle line:90%
People only know electron.

00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Even though Dirac had all the
wrong motivation to write down

00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:34.800 align:middle line:84%
this theory, try to treat it
as a wave equation et cetera,

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:41.620 align:middle line:84%
but he correctly predicted
somehow electron has--

00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:44.980 align:middle line:84%
this theory predict another
positive charged particle.

00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:47.890 align:middle line:90%


00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:51.340 align:middle line:90%
And so, that was in 1930--

00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:53.140 align:middle line:90%
that was in 19--

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:56.993 align:middle line:84%
I think-- when he did
that there was a--

00:55:56.993 --> 00:55:57.910 align:middle line:90%
first wrote this down.

00:55:57.910 --> 00:56:00.940 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was 1929 or 1930.

00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:06.290 align:middle line:84%
So, at that time, you
predict a new particle, that

00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:08.690 align:middle line:90%
was considered to be crazy.

00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And 20 years later, people try
to predict one particle a day.

00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:13.400 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.780 align:middle line:90%
It become a fashion.

00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:22.010 align:middle line:84%
But in 1929, 1930, to predict
existence of new particles,

00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:23.810 align:middle line:90%
people just absolutely crazy.

00:56:23.810 --> 00:56:29.680 align:middle line:90%


00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:32.830 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, I will not explain
how he predicts this particle.

00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, he tried to
understand this wave equations

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:41.480 align:middle line:84%
and then predict there
must be some antiparticle.

00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:45.770 align:middle line:84%
But at the beginning, he
was a little bit afraid.

00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:50.150 align:middle line:84%
He was worried people
will just call him crazy.

00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:52.430 align:middle line:84%
So he said, this particle,
maybe it's a proton.

00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:54.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Say, oh, because people
knew proton at the time.

00:56:58.010 --> 00:57:00.650 align:middle line:84%
He said, maybe this
particle is proton.

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:02.840 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, he
should know immediately

00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:05.440 align:middle line:84%
himself that the
proton does not have

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:06.690 align:middle line:90%
the same mass as the electron.

00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:07.400 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:09.650 align:middle line:90%
So this cannot be proton.

00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:13.490 align:middle line:84%
So and then he quickly
gave up that idea.

00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, maybe
this is a new particle.

00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:18.440 align:middle line:90%
Maybe this is a new particle.

00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:21.410 align:middle line:90%
And so, yeah.

00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:26.700 align:middle line:84%
But, luckily, so in 1931
he changed his mind.

00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:28.670 align:middle line:90%
He said, this is a new particle.

00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So luckily, just in
1932, and Anderson

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:35.740 align:middle line:90%
discovered it in cosmic string--

00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:37.730 align:middle line:90%
oh, no, no, in cosmic rays.

00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And then they found
this new particle

00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:43.520 align:middle line:84%
which have exactly the
same mass as the electron

00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:46.860 align:middle line:84%
but opposite charge
in cosmic ray.

00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:49.720 align:middle line:90%
So that became very happy story.

00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:53.208 align:middle line:90%
It became very happy story.

00:57:53.208 --> 00:57:54.250 align:middle line:90%
So any questions on this?

00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:54.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:56.816 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So wouldn't
any [INAUDIBLE]??

00:57:56.816 --> 00:58:04.440 align:middle line:90%


00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:09.880 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, so indeed,
when he first wrote it down,

00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:13.540 align:middle line:90%
he treated as a wave equation.

00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:16.410 align:middle line:84%
So wave equation-- wave
function is complex.

00:58:16.410 --> 00:58:19.020 align:middle line:84%
So he likely just
treat it as a complex.

00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:22.110 align:middle line:84%
He didn't even try to
make it to be real.

00:58:22.110 --> 00:58:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it is very natural
for it to be complex.

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:27.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and then, yeah.

00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:32.870 align:middle line:90%


00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:36.710 align:middle line:84%
It turns out, if you want
to write the real equation,

00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:39.330 align:middle line:84%
it requires a little
bit more effort,

00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:41.630 align:middle line:84%
which we will describe, I
think, maybe next lecture.

00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and you can get to
the real version of this.

00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:48.410 align:middle line:90%


00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:49.080 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:50.890 align:middle line:84%
But that takes a
little bit more effort.

00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:51.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And that will wait until
Majorana, who discovered it.

00:58:57.090 --> 00:58:58.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:58:58.350 --> 00:59:00.120 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So is
this whole framework

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:04.770 align:middle line:84%
specific to charging
spin one half particle?

00:59:04.770 --> 00:59:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Because it's saying
it has to be charged

00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:07.990 align:middle line:90%
and it has to be spin 1/2 right?

00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:09.970 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, exactly.

00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:10.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:59:10.570 --> 00:59:11.945 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is there
a version that

00:59:11.945 --> 00:59:14.770 align:middle line:84%
could accommodate a
chargeless than 1/2,

00:59:14.770 --> 00:59:17.040 align:middle line:84%
or is that just a
different formalism?

00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:17.790 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:59:17.790 --> 00:59:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Chargeless spin 1/2, that is the
Majorana fermion, which we will

00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:23.050 align:middle line:90%
talk about maybe next lecture.

00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:23.592 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:59:23.592 --> 00:59:24.550 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: But I guess--

00:59:24.550 --> 00:59:25.383 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:59:25.383 --> 00:59:27.390 align:middle line:84%
--build out of this
framework, or is it--

00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:29.473 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, it's built
from this breakthrough,

00:59:29.473 --> 00:59:31.938 align:middle line:84%
but with a little
bit more elaboration.

00:59:31.938 --> 00:59:38.360 align:middle line:90%


00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:42.100 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:46.960 align:middle line:84%
So now lets-- so after talk
about this quantization,

00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:49.900 align:middle line:84%
now we can talk about
correlation functions

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:52.405 align:middle line:90%
of these Dirac fields.

00:59:52.405 --> 01:00:34.690 align:middle line:90%


01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So let's first look at the,
say, the Wightman function,

01:00:37.690 --> 01:00:40.285 align:middle line:84%
which you just don't
do any time ordering.

01:00:40.285 --> 01:00:43.930 align:middle line:90%


01:00:43.930 --> 01:00:45.760 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at this object.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:51.160 align:middle line:84%
I call d plus alpha beta,
which is defined, again,

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.780 align:middle line:84%
due to the time
translation symmetry,

01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:54.190 align:middle line:90%
we only depend on the--

01:00:54.190 --> 01:01:03.060 align:middle line:90%


01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:03.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:04.643 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at this object.

01:01:04.643 --> 01:01:08.630 align:middle line:90%


01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can also
exchange them.

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:13.580 align:middle line:84%
That's called d minus,
so it doesn't matter.

01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah, so let's
look at this object.

01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So this is a 2-point correlation
function between these two

01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:22.830 align:middle line:90%
fermionic fields.

01:01:22.830 --> 01:01:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And then, you can just plug in
the expansion for each of them.

01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Then you just work it out as
we did before for the boson.

01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And so, let me just
outline one step--

01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:38.670 align:middle line:90%
one intermediate step.

01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:44.600 align:middle line:84%
So when you plug them in, then
you find something like this.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And then you find this
sum over s equal to 1, 2,

01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:54.265 align:middle line:84%
and then you find u
s alpha, and the u

01:01:54.265 --> 01:02:02.540 align:middle line:84%
s beta bar, and
exponential i k x minus y.

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:06.490 align:middle line:84%
So now, do you
recognize this object?

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:18.610 align:middle line:90%


01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Anybody recognize it?

01:02:21.970 --> 01:02:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is the object we
discussed last lecture.

01:02:25.330 --> 01:02:26.935 align:middle line:90%
But even though, yeah, but--

01:02:26.935 --> 01:02:30.160 align:middle line:90%


01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:34.630 align:middle line:84%
so this is the projector to
the positive-- to the space

01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:36.880 align:middle line:84%
of the positive
energy solutions.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is the projector to
the space of the U solutions.

01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:42.410 align:middle line:90%
So it appears here.

01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:49.030 align:middle line:84%
So and I mentioned
that this actually--

01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:51.550 align:middle line:90%
you can work it out.

01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:53.050 align:middle line:90%
So this is given by this form.

01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:56.840 align:middle line:90%


01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And then, yeah, so try to check
in your notes of last week--

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.260 align:middle line:90%
on Monday.

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so now, if you plug
this in, and then you get d3x,

01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:24.960 align:middle line:90%
d3k, i, ik slash plus m.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:28.050 align:middle line:84%
So this is a matrix, and you
take alpha beta component.

01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:30.660 align:middle line:90%


01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And then exponential
ik x minus y.

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:44.079 align:middle line:90%


01:03:44.079 --> 01:03:54.660 align:middle line:84%
So now, so remember, in Fourier
transform, any factor k,

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:56.910 align:middle line:84%
in the integrand,
you can take it out

01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:58.810 align:middle line:84%
in terms of a
differential operator.

01:03:58.810 --> 01:04:01.440 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually
rewrite this as i,

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:07.945 align:middle line:84%
take this i out, and replace
this by partial slash,

01:04:07.945 --> 01:04:18.460 align:middle line:84%
but with derivative on x
plus m alpha beta d3k 2 pi.

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:27.790 align:middle line:90%


01:04:27.790 --> 01:04:30.190 align:middle line:84%
So you can just take this
outside of this Fourier

01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:33.137 align:middle line:84%
transform and then
replace k slash

01:04:33.137 --> 01:04:36.123 align:middle line:90%
by partial derivative on x.

01:04:36.123 --> 01:04:37.540 align:middle line:84%
When you take the
derivative on x,

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.610 align:middle line:90%
you bring down a factor of k.

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:40.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, bring down a factor of ik.

01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:45.490 align:middle line:84%
So ik can be replaced
by partial x.

01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:48.190 align:middle line:84%
But now, if you
recognize this guy--

01:04:48.190 --> 01:04:51.580 align:middle line:90%
so do you recognize this guy?

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:54.170 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:59.600 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
do a function?

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.600 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, exactly.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:05.760 align:middle line:84%
This is the Wightman
function for a scalar field.

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:12.200 align:middle line:84%
So now we can just write
it as i partial x slash

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:17.750 align:middle line:84%
plus m alpha beta
and D plus x minus y.

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:19.145 align:middle line:90%
And so, this is the--

01:05:19.145 --> 01:05:22.580 align:middle line:90%


01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:31.095 align:middle line:84%
so D plus x minus y, say,
is the 0 by x by dagger

01:05:31.095 --> 01:05:38.030 align:middle line:84%
y of a scalar field,
say, of a complex scalar.

01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:43.780 align:middle line:90%


01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:47.920 align:middle line:84%
So we see that,
actually, there's

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:55.990 align:middle line:84%
a very nice relation between
the complex scalar Wightman

01:05:55.990 --> 01:06:01.460 align:middle line:90%
function and the fermionic ones.

01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:04.410 align:middle line:84%
There's a very nice
relation between them.

01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:06.245 align:middle line:84%
So they just differ
by this factor.

01:06:06.245 --> 01:06:09.880 align:middle line:90%


01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:13.650 align:middle line:84%
So, similarly, you can
work out other kind

01:06:13.650 --> 01:06:16.330 align:middle line:90%
of correlation function.

01:06:16.330 --> 01:06:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So let me just write down
the result for the others.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:27.600 align:middle line:84%
So you can also define D
minus alpha beta x minus y

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:31.047 align:middle line:84%
to be-- so you just exchange
the order between them.

01:06:31.047 --> 01:06:32.505 align:middle line:84%
So, in general,
they don't commute.

01:06:32.505 --> 01:06:35.520 align:middle line:90%


01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:44.100 align:middle line:90%
So beta y psi alpha x 0.

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.600 align:middle line:90%
And then, you find--

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:49.320 align:middle line:84%
in this case, you find
that given by minus i

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:54.810 align:middle line:84%
partial x slash
plus m alpha beta.

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:57.240 align:middle line:90%
And the D minus--

01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:58.290 align:middle line:90%
x minus y.

01:06:58.290 --> 01:07:01.470 align:middle line:84%
The D minus, again, is defined
as for the scalar field,

01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:02.250 align:middle line:90%
you put--

01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:04.980 align:middle line:90%
you exchange these two.

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And for the retarded, you can
define the Dr alpha plus beta

01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:19.320 align:middle line:90%
to be theta.

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:22.760 align:middle line:90%
So x minus 0 minus y 0.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And now you define retarded
using the anticommutator rather

01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:30.390 align:middle line:84%
than the commutator
we used before.

01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:34.970 align:middle line:84%
So for when we define
a retarded for scalar,

01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:36.680 align:middle line:90%
we use the commutator.

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.630 align:middle line:90%
But now you use anticommutator.

01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:43.850 align:middle line:90%


01:07:43.850 --> 01:07:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And then, now you find that
this is given by, again,

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:57.560 align:middle line:84%
i partial x plus m, the
corresponding retarded scalar

01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:58.295 align:middle line:90%
2-point function.

01:07:58.295 --> 01:08:02.090 align:middle line:90%


01:08:02.090 --> 01:08:07.640 align:middle line:84%
So, finally, we can also
define the time-ordered.

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:23.520 align:middle line:90%


01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.229 align:middle line:84%
So, finally, we can
also define the time

01:08:25.229 --> 01:08:26.271 align:middle line:90%
ordered Feynman function.

01:08:26.271 --> 01:08:34.000 align:middle line:90%


01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.485 align:middle line:90%
So define to be DF alpha beta.

01:08:37.485 --> 01:08:40.029 align:middle line:90%


01:08:40.029 --> 01:08:44.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is defined
to be time-ordered,

01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:52.120 align:middle line:90%
psi alpha x, psi beta bar y 0.

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:57.460 align:middle line:84%
So now, this time-ordering
is defined as following.

01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:59.819 align:middle line:84%
So, again, everything
for fermionic

01:08:59.819 --> 01:09:05.370 align:middle line:84%
fields you replace
commutator by anticommutator.

01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:09.450 align:middle line:84%
You replace commutation
by anticommute.

01:09:09.450 --> 01:09:15.350 align:middle line:84%
So remember, previously,
when you change the order,

01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:20.529 align:middle line:84%
so if the x0 is greater
than y0, and then you

01:09:20.529 --> 01:09:22.370 align:middle line:90%
just maintain this order.

01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:29.904 align:middle line:84%
So you just have 0 psi
alpha x psi bar beta y0.

01:09:29.904 --> 01:09:32.910 align:middle line:90%


01:09:32.910 --> 01:09:38.050 align:middle line:84%
But now when y0 become
greater than x0,

01:09:38.050 --> 01:09:40.104 align:middle line:84%
you exchange the
order between them.

01:09:40.104 --> 01:09:47.870 align:middle line:90%


01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:51.399 align:middle line:84%
And now you add the extra
minus sign for fermion.

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:54.250 align:middle line:84%
So for boson, you
would just have this.

01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:58.780 align:middle line:84%
But now with fermion, you
add an additional minus sign.

01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Then you can show that this
is the same as, again, just

01:10:08.490 --> 01:10:11.700 align:middle line:84%
plus m alpha beta,
the scalar Gf.

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:27.480 align:middle line:90%


01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:31.080 align:middle line:90%
So now we can go to--

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:32.880 align:middle line:84%
so if you want to
do Feynman diagrams,

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:37.170 align:middle line:84%
exactly as we discussed
before, we often

01:10:37.170 --> 01:10:40.000 align:middle line:84%
need the momentum
space expression.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:48.420 align:middle line:84%
So if we go to momentum
space, essentially just

01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:52.200 align:middle line:84%
do a Fourier transform
of x minus y.

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:55.380 align:middle line:84%
So this is a function
of x minus y.

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Do a Fourier
transform, x minus y.

01:10:58.870 --> 01:11:03.730 align:middle line:90%
And then you will get dfk.

01:11:03.730 --> 01:11:06.850 align:middle line:84%
So now I will suppress
this alpha beta indices.

01:11:06.850 --> 01:11:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And now you treat
this as a matrix--

01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:12.650 align:middle line:84%
treat this as a matrix
in the spinor space.

01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And so, you can just
Fourier transform this guy.

01:11:17.650 --> 01:11:18.770 align:middle line:90%
So this is easy.

01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:21.040 align:middle line:84%
We know how to do this
Fourier transform.

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And this just gives
us some factor of k.

01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:32.070 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, you just
get i, ik slash plus m.

01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:36.960 align:middle line:84%
So i partial x slash
just become ik slash.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And then, we just plug in
the expression for scalar

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:46.755 align:middle line:90%
propagator, just given by this.

01:11:46.755 --> 01:11:53.840 align:middle line:90%


01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:56.750 align:middle line:90%
So this is a c number.

01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:59.400 align:middle line:90%
This is a matrix.

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.210 align:middle line:90%
This is a matrix.

01:12:01.210 --> 01:12:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And now, if you remember,
again, this formula,

01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:09.780 align:middle line:84%
that i k that we discussed
last time, ik slash

01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:21.154 align:middle line:84%
m, ik slash minus m,
equal to minus k squared,

01:12:21.154 --> 01:12:25.280 align:middle line:84%
slash minus m squared
equal to, say, minus

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:29.010 align:middle line:90%
k squared minus m square.

01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And so, essentially,
you see that the k

01:12:31.770 --> 01:12:35.200 align:middle line:84%
squared plus m
square is essentially

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:36.800 align:middle line:90%
the product of these two.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:39.040 align:middle line:90%
So this is two matrix product.

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And the right-hand side
is the identity matrix.

01:12:43.210 --> 01:12:45.622 align:middle line:84%
It is this number times
the identity matrix.

01:12:45.622 --> 01:12:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And so, this
becomes-- essentially,

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.330 align:middle line:84%
you should view this as
times identity matrix.

01:12:49.330 --> 01:12:53.280 align:middle line:90%


01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And you see that,
essentially, these two

01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:59.640 align:middle line:84%
up to a constant, these two are
inverse matrix of each other.

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually
rewrite this as just

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:10.590 align:middle line:84%
inverse of this matrix minus
ik slash plus m minus epsilon.

01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:20.770 align:middle line:90%


01:13:20.770 --> 01:13:25.580 align:middle line:84%
So this ik slash minus m is
the inverse matrix of this.

01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah, use this
equation, you find them.

01:13:30.710 --> 01:13:34.040 align:middle line:90%


01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:34.540 align:middle line:90%
Good?

01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:38.420 align:middle line:90%


01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:44.990 align:middle line:84%
So now we conclude with
the momentum space,

01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:48.230 align:middle line:90%
a key expression.

01:13:48.230 --> 01:13:49.640 align:middle line:90%
Is that, this one.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:56.240 align:middle line:84%
So let me just write this
in very prominent position.

01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.950 align:middle line:84%
So this will be
used over and over.

01:13:57.950 --> 01:14:01.070 align:middle line:90%


01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:03.050 align:middle line:90%
So this is a matrix.

01:14:03.050 --> 01:14:05.090 align:middle line:90%
And given by that.

01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:10.870 align:middle line:90%


01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:13.300 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:14.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:14:14.410 --> 01:14:16.780 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is it still true
that the primary function

01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:18.910 align:middle line:84%
is the Green's function
of some wave operator

01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:20.114 align:middle line:90%
for the Dirac equation?

01:14:20.114 --> 01:14:22.680 align:middle line:90%


01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:26.490 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Oh, you mean when
the Dirac equation acting on it

01:14:26.490 --> 01:14:27.780 align:middle line:90%
you get some delta function?

01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:28.140 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:28.410 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:14:28.410 --> 01:14:29.243 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: All right.

01:14:29.243 --> 01:14:33.830 align:middle line:90%


01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:35.365 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Other questions?

01:14:35.365 --> 01:14:37.240 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: That's not
the same epsilon, right?

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:37.823 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Hmm?

01:14:37.823 --> 01:14:40.870 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: The epsilon is
really different physically?

01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:43.030 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: No, the
epsilon is the same.

01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:44.120 align:middle line:90%
It's similar.

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:47.870 align:middle line:84%
It's just it's the
m minus i epsilon.

01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:48.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:14:48.890 --> 01:14:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it is always,
whether it's m

01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:55.370 align:middle line:84%
squared minus epsilon or m
minus epsilon, it's the same.

01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:57.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:14:57.490 --> 01:14:59.020 align:middle line:90%
Just become-- yeah.

01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Here, you only have
one factor of m.

01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:06.380 align:middle line:90%


01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:08.720 align:middle line:90%
Good?

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So let's conclude our
discussion over the quantization

01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:22.670 align:middle line:90%
of the Dirac theory.

01:15:22.670 --> 01:15:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And now we go to the next
topic, which you have already

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:29.530 align:middle line:90%
asked several times.

01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:34.690 align:middle line:84%
But we only have a couple
of minutes to motivate it

01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:35.620 align:middle line:90%
and to discuss it.

01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:42.820 align:middle line:90%


01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:49.435 align:middle line:90%
So the goal is chiral fermions.

01:15:49.435 --> 01:15:53.320 align:middle line:90%


01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:54.728 align:middle line:90%
And [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:54.728 --> 01:16:10.550 align:middle line:90%


01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:13.280 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, we will
not not have time

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:15.140 align:middle line:90%
to really start discussing.

01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And let me just
say a few remarks.

01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:25.060 align:middle line:84%
So we derived before
that the Dirac spinor--

01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:27.070 align:middle line:84%
so, so far, what we
discussed normally

01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:28.630 align:middle line:90%
is called Dirac spinor.

01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:33.760 align:middle line:84%
So they transform under Lorentz
transformation in the way

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:40.600 align:middle line:84%
so that the Dirac
equation is covariant.

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:43.130 align:middle line:90%
So it's a natural question--

01:16:43.130 --> 01:16:45.890 align:middle line:84%
and the Dirac spinor
have eight components.

01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:48.070 align:middle line:90%
So I have eight real component.

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:49.840 align:middle line:90%
You have four complex component.

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:54.100 align:middle line:84%
So altogether, there
are eight variables.

01:16:54.100 --> 01:17:01.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's natural to ask whether
you can reduce the Dirac spinor

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:04.330 align:middle line:90%
into a smaller set.

01:17:04.330 --> 01:17:07.630 align:middle line:84%
So you have-- instead you have
eight independent variables

01:17:07.630 --> 01:17:09.910 align:middle line:90%
into a smaller set.

01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:16.340 align:middle line:84%
That still can give rise
to a Dirac equation,

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:24.670 align:middle line:84%
which transform covariantly
under Lorentz transformation.

01:17:24.670 --> 01:17:27.250 align:middle line:90%
And so, the answer is, yes.

01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:29.600 align:middle line:84%
So there are two
ways of doing it.

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And one is called
the chiral fermions.

01:17:32.410 --> 01:17:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And the other is called
the Majorana fermions.

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And the chiral fermions is
to have two component complex

01:17:44.050 --> 01:17:44.960 align:middle line:90%
vector.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:48.160 align:middle line:84%
So altogether you have
four real components.

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Or you have so-called
Majorana fermions, which

01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:55.670 align:middle line:90%
you have four real components.

01:17:55.670 --> 01:18:00.670 align:middle line:84%
So we will discuss
that next time.

01:18:00.670 --> 01:18:02.880 align:middle line:90%
good, that's all for today.

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:06.000 align:middle line:90%
