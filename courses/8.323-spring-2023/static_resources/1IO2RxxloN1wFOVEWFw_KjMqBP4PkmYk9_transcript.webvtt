00:00:06.986 --> 00:00:10.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.200 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Last time, we started
talking about the quantize--

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.590 align:middle line:84%
the Maxwell theory
in the Lorenz gauge.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.185 align:middle line:84%
So in the Lorenz gauge, we
consider the following action.

00:00:26.185 --> 00:00:35.010 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.530 align:middle line:84%
So we showed earlier
that the Lorentz gauge

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.140 align:middle line:84%
can be ensured just following
the equation of motion.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So you just get from here, the
equation of motion, and then

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.440 align:middle line:90%
the equation of motion--

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.700 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so the equation
of motion will

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:00.240 align:middle line:84%
lead to partial square,
partial mu A mu equal to 0.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.730 align:middle line:84%
So this is ensures partial
mu a mu equal to 0.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.910 align:middle line:84%
You just have to make
sure your boundary

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.425 align:middle line:84%
conditions, such as the
partial mu A mu equal to O. OK?

00:01:10.425 --> 00:01:12.960 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, the
action is particularly

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:22.330 align:middle line:84%
simple for xi equal to 1,
in which case we just have--

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.950 align:middle line:84%
actually we just
have [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.550 align:middle line:90%


00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So as if you just have 4
decoupled massless scalar.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.100 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.520 align:middle line:84%
As if you just have
4 massless scalar.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And the equation of motion
is actually all very simple.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.390 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.860 align:middle line:90%
So we can just proceed.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Copy our result before
for massless scalar.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And just treat each A
mu as a massless scalar,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.420 align:middle line:90%
and then we can just do it.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.970 align:middle line:84%
For example, the canonical
momentum conjugate to A mu

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.085 align:middle line:84%
would be just a mu
dot, just A mu dot.

00:02:15.085 --> 00:02:15.585 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:15.585 --> 00:02:19.230 align:middle line:90%


00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.805 align:middle line:84%
So the canonical quantization
condition, then, is given by--

00:02:23.805 --> 00:02:43.540 align:middle line:90%


00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.670 align:middle line:84%
and we can also just
straightforwardly write down

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:56.020 align:middle line:84%
A mu, the expansion for-- the
operator expansion for A mu.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:07.485 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.485 --> 00:03:07.985 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:07.985 --> 00:03:11.020 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.460 align:middle line:90%
So we have four of them.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.450 align:middle line:90%
So again, we will--

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.810 align:middle line:84%
instead of writing them
as 4 massless scalar,

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.250 align:middle line:84%
we will-- as we did before,
for the Coulomb gauge case,

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.640 align:middle line:84%
we introduce a
polarization vector.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So we will introduce
a polarization vector.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.510 align:middle line:84%
So there are four
possible things.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.380 align:middle line:90%
There are four components.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.940 align:middle line:84%
So there are four
possible polarizations--

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.440 align:middle line:90%
times.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:04:12.070 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.089 align:middle line:90%
So we just get that.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:25.320 align:middle line:84%
So this epsilon mu alpha for
alpha equal to 0, 1, 2, 3--

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.640 align:middle line:84%
so these are four
polarization vectors.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.140 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:36.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:37.680 align:middle line:90%
You can choose.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.250 align:middle line:84%
You can just choose, say, 1,
0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, et cetera.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And then this just like
four decoupled scalar, OK?

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.390 align:middle line:84%
But this way introduces
a polarization vector,

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.240 align:middle line:84%
allowing to write them
in a more general way.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.445 align:middle line:90%
So we normally pick--

00:04:57.445 --> 00:05:05.070 align:middle line:90%


00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.870 align:middle line:84%
for example, the 0-th component,
the 0-th polarization vector

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:84%
just to be along the
time direction, OK?

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.090 align:middle line:84%
So just along the
time direction.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And then we also
introduce another--

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.490 align:middle line:84%
so the number 3,
we introduce to be

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.940 align:middle line:84%
proportional to the
direction of the momentum.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.910 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.470 align:middle line:90%
So this is proportional to the--

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.100 align:middle line:84%
parallel to the momentum,
to the spatial momentum.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.990 align:middle line:90%
So the k mu here would be--

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.490 align:middle line:90%
because this is massless.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.650 align:middle line:90%
So we just have this.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.510 align:middle line:84%
OK so so the 0-th
component is just

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.210 align:middle line:90%
equal to the magnitude of k.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:06:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we take the epsilon 1,
2 epsilon mu, then 1, 2 to be,

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.725 align:middle line:84%
let's say, orthogonal
to the momentum.

00:06:06.725 --> 00:06:09.790 align:middle line:90%


00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:18.940 align:middle line:84%
So these are called the
transverse polarizations.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:25.000 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.280 align:middle line:84%
So we take them also to be
orthogonal to 0-th component.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.620 align:middle line:90%
That means there's no--

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.650 align:middle line:84%
the time component for
1, 2 will be 0, too,

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and then also it should be
proportional-- it should also

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.720 align:middle line:90%
be orthogonal to the momentum.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.730 align:middle line:90%


00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:51.260 align:middle line:84%
So we take, also, them to
be orthogonal to each other.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:58.278 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.278 --> 00:06:59.022 align:middle line:90%
Eta mu nu.

00:06:59.022 --> 00:07:00.855 align:middle line:84%
We take them to be
orthogonal to each other.

00:07:00.855 --> 00:07:06.370 align:middle line:90%


00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle line:84%
This is the normal,
orthonormal condition.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:18.060 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.200 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Take these spaces
to be orthonormal.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.400 align:middle line:90%
And then this is also complete.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Means that if I sum over
different alpha and beta--

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:90%


00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and actually I can
get back to eta mu nu.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.160 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.620 align:middle line:84%
So this is called
the completeness.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.440 align:middle line:90%
So they form a complete basis.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.234 align:middle line:84%
So any Lorentz vector can
be expanded in terms of it.

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:53.340 align:middle line:90%


00:07:53.340 --> 00:08:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So if we take, say, k
to be the z-direction,

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.980 align:middle line:84%
then the simplest choice
would be, say, you just do--

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:08.120 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.395 align:middle line:90%
so we just have that.

00:08:09.395 --> 00:08:31.860 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.270 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this is simplest.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.510 align:middle line:84%
But you can consider more
general polarization.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:40.210 align:middle line:90%


00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And so now, if you
plug in this expansion,

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.460 align:middle line:84%
as we do, for the scalar,
and then you plug in

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.237 align:middle line:84%
back to that
commutation relation,

00:08:51.237 --> 00:08:53.320 align:middle line:84%
then you will get the
commutation relation with a.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.460 align:middle line:90%
So this is straightforward.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.540 align:middle line:84%
So if we call this
equation star--

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.225 align:middle line:90%
star star, this equation star.

00:09:01.225 --> 00:09:03.880 align:middle line:90%


00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:20.180 align:middle line:84%
So plug star star into star,
and then we get the ak alpha ak

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:32.870 align:middle line:84%
prime beta dagger should be
equal to beta alpha beta 2 pi

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:40.710 align:middle line:90%
cubed delta -- prime OK.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And the the rest
commutators are all 0.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:53.500 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.005 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
define the vacuum.

00:09:56.005 --> 00:10:00.310 align:middle line:90%


00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Define a annihlated by all the
alphas for any alpha and k.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:15.300 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And I will introduce
the Hilbert space.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.245 align:middle line:90%
I call it H big to be the psi--

00:10:25.245 --> 00:10:28.740 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:42.930 align:middle line:84%
the collection of psi built by
acting ak alpha dagger on 0.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.630 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:50.370 align:middle line:84%
So you can just add arbitrary
number of them on 0,

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.480 align:middle line:90%
then you get your Hilbert space.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.020 align:middle line:84%
So we call this Hilbert space
to be my big Hilbert space.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And you will see the
reason we do that.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.770 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:05.720 align:middle line:84%
So later, we will see
why we call this H big.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.670 align:middle line:90%
So this is seemingly all fine.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.090 align:middle line:84%
But of course,
there are problems.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:18.120 align:middle line:84%
This cannot be right, because
the Maxwell theory, we said,

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.720 align:middle line:84%
only has two transverse
degrees of freedom.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.040 align:middle line:90%
But here we have four.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.140 align:middle line:84%
We have four massless
with degrees freedom.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.490 align:middle line:90%
We must have too many.

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, you see
there, here, are problems.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.340 align:middle line:90%
So one problem is the following.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:40.210 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:44.218 align:middle line:90%
So one problem is the following.

00:11:44.218 --> 00:11:45.135 align:middle line:90%
So there are problems.

00:11:45.135 --> 00:11:48.670 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.070 align:middle line:90%
So one problem, yeah--

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:52.740 align:middle line:84%
so the zeroth order
problem is that we

00:11:52.740 --> 00:12:02.940 align:middle line:84%
have four massless degrees
of freedom, two too many.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:03.440 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.590 align:middle line:90%


00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So we know that we only
should only have two.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And the second, you see
that this is problematic.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.640 align:middle line:90%


00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.140 align:middle line:90%
Is that, you notice--

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.840 align:middle line:84%
so here, we have eta
alpha beta eta mu mu.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is all just from
Lorentz covariance, OK?

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:34.720 align:middle line:84%
But this eta alpha
beta is problematic

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:45.040 align:middle line:84%
because if you look at
the commutator for ak 0--

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.090 align:middle line:90%
OK, so the zeros--

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:50.410 align:middle line:90%


00:12:50.410 --> 00:13:01.450 align:middle line:84%
that polarization, then you
have ak 0 ak prime 0 dagger

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:05.770 align:middle line:90%
equal to minus 2 pi cubed.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.345 align:middle line:90%
Say delta k minus k prime.

00:13:07.345 --> 00:13:09.910 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.110 align:middle line:90%
OK, you have a minus sign.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:15.290 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:21.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is problematic because
if we, say, create particles--

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:37.850 align:middle line:84%
say if we create the particles
by acting ak alpha dagger

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:46.450 align:middle line:84%
on the 0, and then you find,
because of this minus sign,

00:13:46.450 --> 00:14:04.980 align:middle line:84%
this create the particle with
polarization epsilon alpha mu.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.960 align:middle line:84%
So now, because of
this minus sign,

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:13.140 align:middle line:84%
you see that if we look at the
overlap between the particle

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.690 align:middle line:90%
with the 0 polarization--

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:26.360 align:middle line:84%
so if we look at k 0
with some k prime 0--

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.815 align:middle line:84%
and then because of this
minus sign, we have minus.

00:14:30.815 --> 00:14:33.680 align:middle line:90%


00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:84%
So this will be proportional
to minus 2 pi cube theta cube

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.520 align:middle line:90%
k minus k.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.670 align:middle line:90%
So this is smaller than 0.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:49.835 align:middle line:84%
So you see, actually,
in the product--

00:14:49.835 --> 00:14:52.550 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.790 align:middle line:84%
so that means that this state
actually has negative norm.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:15:04.380 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.090 align:middle line:84%
That means this state
is negative norm.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:17.560 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.350 align:middle line:84%
But this is actually
a good sign.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:24.250 align:middle line:84%
So this is another way
to see that we have

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.130 align:middle line:90%
too many degrees of freedom.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:30.850 align:middle line:84%
So that means not all degrees
of freedom here can be physical.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:34.390 align:middle line:84%
So here, it just tells you there
are some degree of freedom here

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:38.370 align:middle line:84%
that must be unphysical because
they have negative norm.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.250 align:middle line:84%
The states they create
have negative norm.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:43.995 align:middle line:84%
So they cannot really correspond
to genuine physical states.

00:15:43.995 --> 00:15:50.100 align:middle line:90%


00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:54.090 align:middle line:84%
But those problems should
not worry us because, so far,

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:57.720 align:middle line:84%
what we have done is to
quantize this theory.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.553 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.553 --> 00:16:03.720 align:middle line:84%
So far what we have done
is to quantize this theory.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.780 align:middle line:84%
But this theory is not
the Maxwell theory.

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:10.880 align:middle line:84%
To get the Maxwell theory,
we have to do two more steps.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:16.140 align:middle line:84%
One more step-- one step
is to impose conditions

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.950 align:middle line:84%
so that makes sure this
partial mu a mu is equal to 0,

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:21.860 align:middle line:84%
because we haven't
fixed the gauge.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:25.170 align:middle line:84%
The second condition,
we mentioned before.

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.010 align:middle line:84%
So there are two more
things we need to.

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:38.930 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:47.180 align:middle line:84%
So first is that we
need to ensure the gauge

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.560 align:middle line:90%
partial mu A mu is equal to 0.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.340 align:middle line:90%


00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.680 align:middle line:84%
The second thing, as
we mentioned before,

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.070 align:middle line:84%
is that after fixing
the Lorenz gauge,

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:02.580 align:middle line:84%
they're still residual gauge
degrees of freedom left.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And we have to fix
the residual gauge

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.500 align:middle line:90%
freedom in the Lorenz gauge.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.485 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.485 --> 00:17:14.985 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:14.985 --> 00:17:22.700 align:middle line:90%


00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:28.665 align:middle line:84%
So when you do this, then you
will get a physical Hilbert

00:17:28.665 --> 00:17:29.165 align:middle line:90%
space.

00:17:29.165 --> 00:17:31.753 align:middle line:90%


00:17:31.753 --> 00:17:33.420 align:middle line:84%
You will get the
physical Hilbert space.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And this physical Hilbert
space, we will see--

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:40.490 align:middle line:84%
you will see-- will
only contain, indeed,

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:43.700 align:middle line:84%
two transverse massless
degrees of freedom.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And the two degrees of freedom
here are gotten rid of,

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.330 align:middle line:90%
I got rid of.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And so in the past, I described
those procedures in detail

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.630 align:middle line:90%
in class.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.430 align:middle line:84%
But actually, that didn't
have very good effect.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:07.910 align:middle line:90%
So later, I put it in your Pset.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I think
it worked better,

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.980 align:middle line:84%
so forced you to go through it
and to think through it, how

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:16.160 align:middle line:90%
to do these two steps.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Because those steps, they are
not difficult technically,

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:24.680 align:middle line:90%
but you need to think carefully.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.150 align:middle line:90%
You need to think carefully.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:28.835 align:middle line:84%
So let me just make some
comments on this step.

00:18:28.835 --> 00:18:31.410 align:middle line:90%


00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.765 align:middle line:90%
So recall in the Coulomb gauge--

00:18:33.765 --> 00:18:38.410 align:middle line:90%


00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:39.685 align:middle line:90%
so in the Coulomb gauge--

00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:44.830 align:middle line:90%


00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:59.710 align:middle line:84%
so recall in Coulomb gauge,
we impose this condition.

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:01.300 align:middle line:84%
We essentially solve
this condition.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.630 align:middle line:90%
We impose this condition.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.990 align:middle line:84%
So classically, we
impose this condition,

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:07.780 align:middle line:84%
essentially, as part of
the equation of motion.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And we solve the A, which
satisfies this condition.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.650 align:middle line:84%
We just one into two
transverse A, OK?

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And then quantum mechanically,
because we impose it

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:23.060 align:middle line:84%
as a classical
equation-- we impose it

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.430 align:middle line:84%
as part of the equation
of motion, classically.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:28.050 align:middle line:84%
So quantum mechanically, this
becomes an operator equation,

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:31.300 align:middle line:90%
which we impose on operators.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:36.150 align:middle line:84%
But in this case, we
can no longer impose.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:37.995 align:middle line:90%
But in Lorenz gauge--

00:19:37.995 --> 00:19:39.645 align:middle line:84%
so this leads to the
operator equation.

00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:43.110 align:middle line:90%


00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:58.910 align:middle line:84%
But in the Lorenz gauge, we
cannot impose partial mu a mu

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:11.960 align:middle line:84%
as the operator equation,
because the equation of motion

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:16.950 align:middle line:84%
already almost implies
this is equal to 0.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:21.240 align:middle line:84%
We just have to impose
some boundary condition

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.720 align:middle line:84%
to ensure that, indeed,
this equation only has

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.260 align:middle line:84%
solutions corresponding to
partial mu and mu equal to 0.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.030 align:middle line:84%
So if you impose this
separately as the--

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:34.580 align:middle line:90%


00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.320 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.350 align:middle line:84%
So you only need to impose
them as boundary condition.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:44.780 align:middle line:84%
So quantum mechanically, that
implies we cannot impose this

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:45.920 align:middle line:90%
as an operator equation.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, you are
showing your pset,

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.887 align:middle line:84%
and it will be
inconsistent if you impose

00:20:49.887 --> 00:20:51.095 align:middle line:90%
this as an operator equation.

00:20:51.095 --> 00:20:53.600 align:middle line:90%


00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.410 align:middle line:84%
So what does it mean at the
common level corresponding

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:02.280 align:middle line:84%
to classically you impose
the boundary condition?

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.420 align:middle line:84%
So classically-imposed
boundary condition

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.850 align:middle line:84%
limits possible
configurations you

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:11.650 align:middle line:84%
can have, limit possible
configurations you can have

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:13.900 align:middle line:84%
at the quantum-mechanical
level corresponding

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.510 align:middle line:90%
to restriction on the states.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:20.480 align:middle line:84%
So the quantum level, it turns
out that the right thing to do

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:25.130 align:middle line:84%
is to impose this kind of
condition on the states,

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:29.210 align:middle line:84%
require your states
to be annihilated

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:32.160 align:middle line:90%
by something like this.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.420 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out, actually, the
story is more subtle than that.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:39.860 align:middle line:84%
If you just require the state
annihilated by this thing,

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.202 align:middle line:90%
actually it does not work.

00:21:41.202 --> 00:21:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to do a
little bit more subtle.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.200 align:middle line:90%
So the fun will be in your Pset.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.790 align:middle line:90%
You will go through that.

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:49.020 align:middle line:90%
You'll go through that.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:52.830 align:middle line:90%
So do you have any questions?

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:53.820 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.275 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Why is it too
much to just say that is 0?

00:21:56.275 --> 00:21:58.650 align:middle line:84%
I guess it makes sense that
you can just fix the boundary

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.770 align:middle line:90%
conditions but --

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:04.010 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
classically, it does not matter.

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:07.210 align:middle line:84%
As a classical,
it doesn't matter.

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:10.960 align:middle line:84%
But quantum mechanically,
you will show you

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.860 align:middle line:84%
a P set if you impose this
as an operator equation.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Then that's incompatible with
this canonical quantization

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.720 align:middle line:90%
condition.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.910 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, here, I just
motivate that classically

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.850 align:middle line:84%
in order to ensure this unity to
impose the boundary condition,

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:29.900 align:middle line:90%
not as the equation of motion.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.140 align:middle line:84%
So quantum mechanically,
we just-- yeah.

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:36.253 align:middle line:90%


00:22:36.253 --> 00:22:36.920 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.766 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is there a reason why
the subspace with positive norm

00:22:40.766 --> 00:22:42.474 align:middle line:84%
is like closed -- a
closed Hilbert space?

00:22:42.474 --> 00:22:45.780 align:middle line:90%


00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.030 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you will see.

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:48.710 align:middle line:90%
You will see.

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:50.450 align:middle line:84%
You will see what's
happening, yeah.

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:52.100 align:middle line:90%
So it turns out--

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.830 align:middle line:84%
yeah, let me just
say some words.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:59.150 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out when
you do this step,

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:02.400 align:middle line:90%
and then you will eliminate--

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:12.285 align:middle line:84%
so the step one, we eliminate
the negative norm state.

00:23:12.285 --> 00:23:17.000 align:middle line:90%


00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.550 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:23.260 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: So you find that once
you impose properly this kind

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.750 align:middle line:84%
of condition on the
states, and you actually

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:28.810 align:middle line:84%
eliminate the
negative norm state.

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.420 align:middle line:84%
But then you find after you
eliminate the negative norm

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.775 align:middle line:90%
states, in this Hilbert space--

00:23:34.775 --> 00:23:37.970 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:44.090 align:middle line:84%
in this Hilbert space, there's
still states of zero-norm.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:45.920 align:middle line:84%
There's still
states of zero-norm.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And then when you fix
the second, and then

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:52.785 align:middle line:84%
you eliminate those
zero-norm states.

00:23:52.785 --> 00:23:56.160 align:middle line:90%


00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And then you get your
physical Hilbert space,

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:04.440 align:middle line:84%
because, remember,
in the Coulomb gauge,

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.850 align:middle line:84%
everything is just like
harmonic oscillator.

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:11.340 align:middle line:90%
There's no zero-norm state.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.140 align:middle line:90%
You fix the gauge completely.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.410 align:middle line:84%
But here, because you didn't
fix the gauge completely--

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:19.170 align:middle line:84%
and even after you eliminate
those negative norm states,

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:20.610 align:middle line:90%
you have zero-norm states.

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And then they correspond
to remaining gauge freedom.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:28.804 align:middle line:84%
And once you get rid of them,
and then you have your--

00:24:28.804 --> 00:24:29.304 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:24:29.304 --> 00:24:31.990 align:middle line:90%


00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:33.290 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.110 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.662 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:24:35.662 --> 00:24:37.620 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Instead of
doing Maxwell theory, what

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:40.390 align:middle line:84%
if we're just trying to
do four massless scalars?

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:42.472 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:24:42.472 --> 00:24:44.680 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: And if you try to
do it with these vectors,

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.314 align:middle line:84%
you'd still get
these negative norms.

00:24:46.314 --> 00:24:48.923 align:middle line:90%


00:24:48.923 --> 00:24:49.840 align:middle line:90%
What's going on there?

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.273 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Good, good, good.

00:24:51.273 --> 00:24:52.690 align:middle line:84%
That's a very good
question, which

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:56.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm waiting for you to ask.

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:57.950 align:middle line:90%
So the key thing--

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.970 align:middle line:84%
so you say we can certainly
consider four massless scalar

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.200 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.510 align:middle line:84%
If I consider four
Maxwell scalar field,

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:07.000 align:middle line:84%
there should not
be a problem, why

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.400 align:middle line:84%
there should be negative norm
state or zero-norm state.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:14.955 align:middle line:84%
But the key is that
here, the states

00:25:14.955 --> 00:25:17.820 align:middle line:84%
are contract-- this A
mu A mu are contracted

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:21.410 align:middle line:90%
using the Lorentzian metric.

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And so if you look
at this Lagrangian,

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:29.350 align:middle line:84%
the 0-th components actually
have the opposite sign

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:35.570 align:middle line:84%
to the standard massless scalar
field, and because of that.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:37.930 align:middle line:84%
So this is not your ordinary
massless scalar field.

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:40.770 align:middle line:84%
They actually have opposite
signs in your Lagrangian.

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.630 align:middle line:84%
But you say, oh,
can we just change

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:43.920 align:middle line:90%
the sign for that component?

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.875 align:middle line:84%
You cannot because we
have Lorentz symmetry.

00:25:46.875 --> 00:25:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Because we have
Lorentz symmetry.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.630 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: So the Lorentz
symmetry forces you, somehow,

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:54.210 align:middle line:84%
when you reduce the Maxwell
theory to this four massless

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:56.550 align:middle line:84%
scalar, one of them
have the wrong sign.

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:59.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's why-- so that the
wrong sign is related to why

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:00.780 align:middle line:90%
you have the wrong sign here.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:04.050 align:middle line:90%


00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:06.630 align:middle line:84%
The same kind of
Lorentz covariance

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:11.217 align:middle line:84%
tells you here is eta alpha beta
rather than delta alpha beta,

00:26:11.217 --> 00:26:12.300 align:middle line:90%
and then delta alpha beta.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:16.650 align:middle line:90%


00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:18.330 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So this concludes our discussion
of the canonical quantization

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:27.870 align:middle line:90%
for the Maxwell series.

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:29.818 align:middle line:84%
So here I will
quickly describe how

00:26:29.818 --> 00:26:31.110 align:middle line:90%
to do it for the path integral.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:34.080 align:middle line:90%


00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:37.890 align:middle line:84%
So I will just do
it very quickly,

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:42.250 align:middle line:84%
because many of the elements
are familiar before.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I will just
point out things which

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:49.270 align:middle line:90%
are new for the Maxwell case.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:49.770 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:49.770 --> 00:27:04.520 align:middle line:90%


00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:10.040 align:middle line:84%
So we already familiar how
to do the path integral.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.960 align:middle line:84%
So Maxwell theory
is a free theory.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.300 align:middle line:84%
So in principle, we
know how to do it.

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.920 align:middle line:90%
So let's just-- yeah.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:22.300 align:middle line:84%
So here, let's go back without
fixing the gauge first, OK?

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:27.040 align:middle line:84%
So this is now completely
starting from the original,

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:36.220 align:middle line:84%
just starting from the Maxwell
equal to minus 1/4 as with mu F

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.048 align:middle line:90%
mu mu.

00:27:39.048 --> 00:27:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So let's just go
back to this theory.

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:43.500 align:middle line:90%


00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:46.850 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to this theory.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And then let's
just try to do a--

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:55.630 align:middle line:84%
try to see how the
path integral works.

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:59.700 align:middle line:84%
So remember, this
is a free theory.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So we can just write down
the generating functional

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:03.180 align:middle line:90%
for this theory.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And then we can, in
principle, calculate

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.170 align:middle line:84%
all possible correlation
functions here.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Free theory is supposed
to be very simple.

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So we just write down the
generating functional, which

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:17.380 align:middle line:90%
we integrate over all A mu.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.330 align:middle line:90%
And then we have i S--

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:22.750 align:middle line:90%
so this is Maxwell theory--

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:23.800 align:middle line:90%
then we add the source.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:31.550 align:middle line:90%


00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So this J mu will
have nothing to do

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:34.630 align:middle line:90%
with electromagnetic current.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:37.010 align:middle line:84%
This is just a J mu with
the generating function

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:42.360 align:middle line:90%
used to take derivatives.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.955 align:middle line:84%
So this is just an
external source.

00:28:44.955 --> 00:28:48.110 align:middle line:90%


00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:49.680 align:middle line:84%
So now this is a
Gaussian integral.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:54.920 align:middle line:84%
So in principle,
we can just do it.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
quadratic, and now

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.780 align:middle line:84%
we are familiar how to do
the quadratic integral.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.610 align:middle line:90%
We can just do it.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:11.565 align:middle line:84%
And to do it inside, we always
write it in the form like this.

00:29:11.565 --> 00:29:17.050 align:middle line:90%


00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:18.415 align:middle line:90%
We write it in the matrix form.

00:29:18.415 --> 00:29:27.780 align:middle line:90%


00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:30.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, we write it
as a matrix form.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And this K mu nu just can be
read from here by integration

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.650 align:middle line:90%
by parts, et cetera.

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So let me just write
down the answer.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:43.370 align:middle line:84%
So this gave me
mu just equal to--

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:50.490 align:middle line:84%
so let me call this 0,
call this 0 K mu nu.

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:54.000 align:middle line:84%
So this just given
by partial square eta

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.933 align:middle line:84%
mu nu minus partial mu
partial nu, and then

00:30:00.933 --> 00:30:01.725 align:middle line:90%
the delta function.

00:30:01.725 --> 00:30:04.570 align:middle line:90%


00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:05.750 align:middle line:90%
And the delta function.

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:08.050 align:middle line:84%
So this partial
will only act on x.

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:10.560 align:middle line:90%


00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.110 align:middle line:90%
So naively, we can just--

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:14.850 align:middle line:84%
so now this is just
a Gaussian integral,

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:17.835 align:middle line:84%
so we can use principle just to
directly write down the answer.

00:30:17.835 --> 00:30:26.590 align:middle line:90%


00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:28.090 align:middle line:90%
Actually, let me keep this here.

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:46.380 align:middle line:90%


00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:49.010 align:middle line:84%
So in principle, we can just
directly write down the answer,

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:57.920 align:middle line:84%
just this Z J equal to some
number, some infinite number,

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:03.365 align:middle line:84%
which we never care,
and the exponential i

00:31:03.365 --> 00:31:14.660 align:middle line:90%
d 4x d 4y then J mu x.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:27.410 align:middle line:90%
Then the K 0 mu nu minus 1.

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:29.225 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so let me just
write it like this.

00:31:29.225 --> 00:31:32.340 align:middle line:90%


00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:35.290 align:middle line:90%
K0 minus 1 mu mu.

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:39.030 align:middle line:90%


00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:42.762 align:middle line:90%
x minus y J mu.

00:31:42.762 --> 00:31:43.262 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:43.262 --> 00:31:46.430 align:middle line:90%


00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:51.580 align:middle line:84%
So this is just almost exactly
the same as we do before.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:55.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is like the kernel
for your Gaussian integral.

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And you just take
the inverse of it.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And then you contract
it with the source.

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:05.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you just know the only
difference from the scalar

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:13.660 align:middle line:84%
case, or the spinor case, other
than the functional space of x

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:16.630 align:middle line:84%
and y, now you
also have a matrix

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:20.745 align:middle line:84%
in terms of Lorentz
index, mu nu.

00:32:20.745 --> 00:32:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Everything is the
same as before.

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:25.780 align:middle line:90%


00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:30.260 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like, then, we
already solved this theory, OK?

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:33.060 align:middle line:90%
But you should feel uneasy.

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.710 align:middle line:84%
You should feel
easy because when

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:37.410 align:middle line:84%
we quantize it using
the canonical method,

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:40.750 align:middle line:84%
we do have to go
through some trouble.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So how come, somehow,
path integral just do it

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:43.990 align:middle line:90%
immediately?

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Somehow the trouble
has to be conserved,

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:51.850 align:middle line:84%
no matter what method you use,
no matter what method you use.

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, can someone guess what
would be the potential trouble

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:57.250 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:57.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:01.690 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Are you
overcounting, because when

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:05.500 align:middle line:84%
you integrate over, like,
DA, you could have two--

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.740 align:middle line:90%
two A's differ only by gauge?

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:10.480 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.830 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so then you're
integrating over too many?

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:17.290 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, indeed.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:19.870 align:middle line:90%
That's the correct statement.

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:22.060 align:middle line:84%
But if I just do it
straightforwardly,

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:25.345 align:middle line:84%
somehow, then what's
wrong with that?

00:33:25.345 --> 00:33:31.370 align:middle line:90%


00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:33.810 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, what you said is
conceptually-- conceptually,

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:36.930 align:middle line:84%
you should suspect there's
something wrong here.

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:39.050 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you
conceptually suspect

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:40.670 align:middle line:84%
there's something
wrong here, then you

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:44.030 align:middle line:84%
should technically be looking
for some mathematical problem,

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:46.130 align:middle line:84%
because the conceptual
mistake will always

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:48.770 align:middle line:84%
reflect in some
mathematical difficulty.

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:50.383 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:33:50.383 --> 00:33:51.800 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So you
have to integrate

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.763 align:middle line:90%
to measure [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:55.763 --> 00:33:56.430 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:57.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you're right.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.563 align:middle line:84%
It's just you
integrate more things.

00:33:59.563 --> 00:34:01.980 align:middle line:84%
You integrate more things,
then you just get more infinite

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.420 align:middle line:90%
constant, but we don't care.

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:06.210 align:middle line:90%


00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:09.090 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Maybe like
a sign will be off,

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:10.860 align:middle line:84%
because the sign was
off earlier, right?

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:14.730 align:middle line:84%
So when you do the eigenvalues
of the determinant or whatever,

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:15.810 align:middle line:90%
maybe it messes that up.

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:16.800 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but we have i, so it
doesn't matter the sign.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:20.937 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:34:20.937 --> 00:34:23.520 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Does the K end up not
being invertible or something?

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.690 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:29.048 align:middle line:84%
So the key is that the K
is actually not invertible.

00:34:29.048 --> 00:34:31.320 align:middle line:90%
Turns out K minus 1--

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:38.639 align:middle line:84%
so K 0 actually
is not invertible.

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:47.699 align:middle line:90%


00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:50.330 align:middle line:90%
So the reason is simple.

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:52.550 align:middle line:84%
It's that because
the gauge freedom

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:55.949 align:middle line:90%
in the original theory--

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:58.950 align:middle line:84%
because the gauge freedom
in the original theory,

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:03.360 align:middle line:84%
by gauge freedom, we mean that
when you make a transformation

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:08.850 align:middle line:84%
by some arbitrary function,
your action does not change.

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Then that means that this
kernel must be invariant

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:17.070 align:middle line:90%
under some transformation.

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:19.350 align:middle line:84%
It's invariant under
some transformation means

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:22.170 align:middle line:84%
that this must have
zero eigenvector.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:25.290 align:middle line:84%
When it has zero
eigenvector, then they

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:27.900 align:middle line:90%
must not be invertible.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:28.920 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:32.715 align:middle line:84%
So now let's just see it
explicitly.] To see it

00:35:32.715 --> 00:35:37.100 align:middle line:84%
explicitly, it's easier to
see this in momentum space.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:39.020 align:middle line:84%
So if we see this
in momentum space--

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:48.052 align:middle line:90%


00:35:48.052 --> 00:35:50.260 align:middle line:84%
so in momentum space, we
can just directly write down

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:53.470 align:middle line:90%
the K0 mu mu.

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:59.220 align:middle line:84%
It's just equal to k
square, just k mu k

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:04.240 align:middle line:90%
nu minus k square eta mu mu.

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:10.310 align:middle line:90%


00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:14.180 align:middle line:84%
So now it's obvious this
has a zero eigenvector

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:19.020 align:middle line:84%
because this is precisely
the minus k square,

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:20.700 align:middle line:90%
the transverse projector.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:25.030 align:middle line:90%


00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:28.180 align:middle line:84%
So P mu nu T is the
projector into the direction

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.820 align:middle line:90%
perpendicular to k mu.

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:35.370 align:middle line:84%
So this satisfies the
property that pT mu

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:44.490 align:middle line:84%
mu is equal to eta mu mu minus
k mu k mu divided by k square,

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:50.905 align:middle line:84%
and satisfies the property p mu
mu T k nu is always equal to 0.

00:36:50.905 --> 00:36:51.405 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:51.405 --> 00:36:56.770 align:middle line:90%


00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So you can easily see
it, because if you

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:01.540 align:middle line:84%
contract with this k mu,
and k mu contract with here

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.840 align:middle line:84%
and give you k square, and
cancel with k square here,

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and you have k mu, and then
k mu contract with this one,

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:08.710 align:middle line:90%
you just get k mu.

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:11.110 align:middle line:90%
So they get canceled.

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:13.450 align:middle line:84%
So this is the projector
to the transverse space.

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it has
zero eigenvalue--

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:18.020 align:middle line:90%
zero eigenvectors.

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:21.490 align:middle line:90%


00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:25.000 align:middle line:84%
So then we see that this is not
invertible in momentum space,

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.460 align:middle line:84%
and then it will not be
invertible in coordinate space.

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:30.530 align:middle line:84%
It will not be invertible
in coordinate space.

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And now, in coordinate
space, now we

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:39.270 align:middle line:84%
can see with this
understanding, then

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:42.740 align:middle line:84%
now we can immediately
see in coordinate space

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:45.290 align:middle line:84%
the eigenvector
of zero eigenvalue

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:48.240 align:middle line:84%
precisely corresponding
to a gauge transformation.

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:56.950 align:middle line:90%


00:37:56.950 --> 00:38:04.990 align:middle line:84%
It's because in coordinate
space, k mu translate--

00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:09.930 align:middle line:84%
when you translate to coordinate
space, means partial mu.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So k mu to coordinate
space means partial mu.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:28.760 align:middle line:84%
So that means that for any
function, partial mu lambda--

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:34.250 align:middle line:84%
this is K0 mu nu, partial
nu lambda must be 0.

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:38.140 align:middle line:90%


00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.010 align:middle line:90%
And you can check explicitly.

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:44.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you contract
with partial mu here,

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:48.870 align:middle line:84%
and then you have a partial
square and you have partial mu,

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:52.800 align:middle line:84%
and then eta mu mu will give you
partial mu, again, they cancel.

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this is
just precisely the gauge

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.000 align:middle line:90%
transformation.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.073 align:middle line:84%
This is precisely the
gauge transformation.

00:38:59.073 --> 00:39:03.150 align:middle line:90%


00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:05.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the gauge
transformation precisely

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:09.330 align:middle line:84%
is the zero eigenvector
of this kernel.

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:13.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the eigenvector of zero
eigenvalue of this kernel.

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:15.090 align:middle line:84%
So that's why this
is not invertible.

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:28.530 align:middle line:90%


00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:35.650 align:middle line:84%
So the way to fix is simple
because remember this picture.

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:41.580 align:middle line:84%
So this is the space of the
full configurations of A mu.

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And A mu along those
trajectories are equivalent.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:47.820 align:middle line:90%


00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:50.430 align:middle line:84%
To quantize it,
we need to just--

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:52.470 align:middle line:84%
the physical configuration
corresponding

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:54.940 align:middle line:90%
to a section of it.

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:59.140 align:middle line:84%
So what this says
is that K0 is not

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:02.440 align:middle line:84%
invertible in this full
space because you have

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.253 align:middle line:84%
zero eigenvectors
along this direction,

00:40:05.253 --> 00:40:06.670 align:middle line:84%
OK, zero eigenvector
corresponding

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:07.490 align:middle line:90%
to this direction.

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:12.370 align:middle line:84%
But if we restrict to a
cross-section, and then

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:15.220 align:middle line:84%
this zero eigenvector
no longer exists.

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:17.350 align:middle line:90%
And then it will be invertible.

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:21.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, so once we fix the
gauge, then we expect--

00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:24.760 align:middle line:84%
then the k mu after we fix the
gauge should be invertible.

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:29.400 align:middle line:90%


00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.380 align:middle line:90%
So now let's fix the gauge.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:37.340 align:middle line:90%


00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:48.390 align:middle line:84%
So K0 mu nu restricted
to a section

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:50.960 align:middle line:90%
should it be invertible.

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:55.070 align:middle line:90%


00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:59.135 align:middle line:90%
OK, so we need to fix the gauge.

00:40:59.135 --> 00:41:06.700 align:middle line:90%


00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.660 align:middle line:84%
So we will do this
for the Lorenz gauge.

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:13.830 align:middle line:84%
You can do similar things
for the Coulomb gauge.

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:15.450 align:middle line:84%
The reason we do
the Lorenz gauge,

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:20.650 align:middle line:84%
just the Lorenz gauge, later
when we introduce interactions,

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:23.040 align:middle line:84%
we will always work
with the Lorenz gauge.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.855 align:middle line:84%
And when we discuss
QED, we will always

00:41:24.855 --> 00:41:25.980 align:middle line:90%
work with the Lorenz gauge.

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:28.860 align:middle line:84%
So here I will elaborate
in the Lorenz gauge.

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:29.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:31.180 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Can you
explain what you

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:33.090 align:middle line:84%
mean by when you do
the cross-section,

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:35.160 align:middle line:84%
the eigenvectors here
doesn't exist anymore?

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.960 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.060 align:middle line:90%
So this zero eigenvector--

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:43.110 align:middle line:84%
so this is a zero
eigenvector of the K0, right?

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So at the partial mu,
partial mu lambda, just

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:50.120 align:middle line:90%
parameterize this direction.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:54.580 align:middle line:84%
But if you restrict to a
section of it, and then

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:58.000 align:middle line:84%
you are not allowed
to worry away from it.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And then this
direction just gone,

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:03.700 align:middle line:84%
so you no longer have that
zero eigenvector anymore.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:05.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:05.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:08.510 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Should there be a
convolution in the equation

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:11.480 align:middle line:90%
on the bottom left?

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:12.320 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, good.

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:15.980 align:middle line:90%


00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, you have to
integrate-- yeah,

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:18.950 align:middle line:90%
you have to integrate over y.

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:20.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.710 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, if I write
this precisely, you

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:27.560 align:middle line:84%
have to integrate
over this y and y.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's right.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is the proper
way to write it.

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:34.030 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:35.760 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Why does
this issue only

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.710 align:middle line:90%
happen for gauge symmetries?

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Like, why don't the other
symmetries need to do the same?

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.110 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Because other symmetries--
you have local symmetries.

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:50.460 align:middle line:84%
So the local symmetry
tells you there's

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.980 align:middle line:84%
really some degree
of freedom redundant.

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:55.530 align:middle line:84%
So this is really
corresponding to--

00:42:55.530 --> 00:43:00.240 align:middle line:84%
so this lambda x, so all
possible choice of lambda,

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:04.290 align:middle line:84%
is really corresponding
to some finite trajectory

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:06.370 align:middle line:90%
in your configuration space.

00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:07.890 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
global symmetry,

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:10.870 align:middle line:84%
global symmetry is
independent of coordinates.

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:13.470 align:middle line:84%
So from this point of
view, a global symmetry

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:16.050 align:middle line:84%
just relates to the
configuration at this point

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:20.400 align:middle line:84%
to the configuration at that
point and at that point.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.820 align:middle line:84%
A global symmetry, because
it's independent of spacetime,

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:28.040 align:middle line:84%
that transformation
doesn't change your number

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.590 align:middle line:90%
of degrees of freedom.

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:31.930 align:middle line:84%
They don't correspond
to actually a trajectory

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:33.700 align:middle line:90%
in your configuration space.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:37.540 align:middle line:90%


00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.260 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:41.330 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:43.180 align:middle line:90%
OK, very good.

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:45.710 align:middle line:90%
So now we will fix the gauge.

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:50.800 align:middle line:84%
So in the path integral, to
fix the gauge, in principle,

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.320 align:middle line:90%
is straightforward.

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:54.865 align:middle line:84%
So we will consider
Lorenz gauge.

00:43:54.865 --> 00:43:59.350 align:middle line:90%


00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:00.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:04.540 align:middle line:84%
You can do the similar thing
with the Coulomb gauge.

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Just Lorenz gauge,
normally, we work with more.

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:11.120 align:middle line:90%
So how do we fix the gauge?

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:15.130 align:middle line:84%
So in the path integral,
we do it easily.

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:18.810 align:middle line:90%
So we have this integral.

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Then we insert the delta
function corresponding

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.470 align:middle line:90%
to the Lorenz gauge.

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:30.810 align:middle line:90%


00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:37.120 align:middle line:84%
So this should be considered
as a delta function.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So this is a delta
function at one point,

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:41.350 align:middle line:84%
and then you take the
product over all points.

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:44.740 align:middle line:84%
So this is the delta function
in the functional space.

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we will have
i S, this S Maxwell,

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:55.680 align:middle line:84%
and then you can have A J. You
can consider the generating

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:57.490 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:10.820 align:middle line:84%
So this will restrict you
on some cross-section,

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:12.780 align:middle line:90%
on some cross-section.

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:13.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:20.090 align:middle line:90%


00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:21.455 align:middle line:90%
So let me make a remark here.

00:45:21.455 --> 00:45:24.017 align:middle line:90%


00:45:24.017 --> 00:45:26.475 align:middle line:84%
So here, you actually have to
be a little bit more careful.

00:45:26.475 --> 00:45:29.270 align:middle line:90%


00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:32.840 align:middle line:84%
So what we actually
really want to do--

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:37.835 align:middle line:84%
OK, what we really want to do
is we just want to insert here.

00:45:37.835 --> 00:45:41.720 align:middle line:90%


00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:46.370 align:middle line:84%
We just want to
insert here delta A mu

00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:48.740 align:middle line:90%
equal to A mu gauge fixed.

00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:54.410 align:middle line:90%


00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:56.900 align:middle line:84%
What we want, what
we really want, to do

00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:01.940 align:middle line:84%
is we want just to restrict
A mu to some cross-section.

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:05.507 align:middle line:90%


00:46:05.507 --> 00:46:07.340 align:middle line:84%
But for example, here,
for the Lorenz gauge,

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:09.410 align:middle line:84%
we can normally not
solve this condition.

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:11.930 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we
do here, because we

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:15.560 align:middle line:84%
don't know how to write
this a mu fixed explicitly.

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.540 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:20.630 align:middle line:84%
But going from here to
here, actually there's

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:26.190 align:middle line:84%
a non-trivial Jacobian,
because this is a non-trivial

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:27.750 align:middle line:90%
in the functional space.

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And then this is a
non-trivial function on A mu.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:39.908 align:middle line:90%
So in principle-- the related--

00:46:39.908 --> 00:46:41.325 align:middle line:84%
in principle, there
is a Jacobian.

00:46:41.325 --> 00:46:47.122 align:middle line:90%


00:46:47.122 --> 00:46:48.580 align:middle line:84%
So let me just
write this explicit.

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:52.760 align:middle line:90%


00:46:52.760 --> 00:47:00.820 align:middle line:84%
A mu x are related by
some Jacobian, then

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:04.690 align:middle line:84%
delta A mu minus
delta A mu fixed--

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:11.660 align:middle line:90%
uh minus A mu fixed, OK?

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:16.550 align:middle line:90%


00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:20.000 align:middle line:84%
But now, notice that this
function is a linear function

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.980 align:middle line:84%
of A. So remember, when
you do the Jacobian,

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:25.480 align:middle line:90%
you have to take the derivative.

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:28.530 align:middle line:90%


00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just remember
this function.

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:33.950 align:middle line:90%
Remember this formula.

00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Delta f x is equal to 1 over
f prime x delta x minus x 0.

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:45.680 align:middle line:84%
So x0 is a solution
for f x equal to 0.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:46.180 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:49.390 align:middle line:90%


00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And so you have-- yeah,
so this is a Jacobian when

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:57.730 align:middle line:90%
you convert the delta function.

00:47:57.730 --> 00:48:00.458 align:middle line:84%
If you have multiple
variables, then this

00:48:00.458 --> 00:48:01.375 align:middle line:90%
would be the Jacobian.

00:48:01.375 --> 00:48:04.260 align:middle line:90%


00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So this course, you take the
derivative on this function.

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:10.870 align:middle line:90%
But this is a linear--

00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:13.185 align:middle line:90%
this thing is linear in A mu.

00:48:13.185 --> 00:48:14.560 align:middle line:84%
When you take the
derivative, you

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.380 align:middle line:84%
will get something which
is independent of a mu.

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:21.660 align:middle line:84%
So this Jacobian will
just involve in some--

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:25.050 align:middle line:84%
it will be independent of
a mu in the function space.

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:28.158 align:middle line:84%
Something independent of a
mu is just some constant.

00:48:28.158 --> 00:48:30.075 align:middle line:84%
So this just gives you
some infinite constant.

00:48:30.075 --> 00:48:35.150 align:middle line:90%


00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And so we always
throw infinite numbers

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:40.090 align:middle line:84%
infinite number of ways,
so we don't care about it.

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And so we can just
write down this.

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.680 align:middle line:90%
So this is just a remark.

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:52.550 align:middle line:90%


00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:56.040 align:middle line:84%
So now we have to
evaluate this guy.

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:59.290 align:middle line:90%


00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:02.840 align:middle line:84%
So now we have to
evaluate this guy.

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:05.810 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that this guy
is still not easy to solve.

00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:08.967 align:middle line:84%
And for the same, it's
not easy to do, just

00:49:08.967 --> 00:49:09.800 align:middle line:90%
for the same reason.

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.930 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how to
solve this A mu fixed.

00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:15.260 align:middle line:84%
OK, we don't know how to solve
this condition explicitly.

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:18.290 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going
to use some trick.

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:21.920 align:middle line:90%
I will use two tricks.

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:25.010 align:middle line:84%
OK, I will use two
tricks to convert this

00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:30.900 align:middle line:84%
into something manageable, to
convert into this manageable.

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And so this trick
applying to the Maxwell

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:42.280 align:middle line:84%
is like killing a little
bird with a big cannon.

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah, it works
here, but it's real,

00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:50.270 align:middle line:84%
genuine use is actually in
the long Abelian gauge theory.

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:52.630 align:middle line:84%
So when you quantize
the Yang-Mills theory,

00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:56.590 align:middle line:84%
that becomes essential, because
it will be very complicated

00:49:56.590 --> 00:49:58.120 align:middle line:90%
quantizing using other methods.

00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And so quantizing Yang-Mills
theory become essential.

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:05.620 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, let me just
tell you these two tricks,

00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:06.890 align:middle line:90%
how to treat this here.

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:07.390 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:19.500 align:middle line:90%


00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:23.420 align:middle line:84%
So this method is called
Faddeev-Popov method,

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:30.510 align:middle line:84%
and it was invented by two
Russians, former Soviet,

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:33.720 align:middle line:90%
Faddeev, Popov, in the '60s.

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:38.640 align:middle line:90%


00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:42.350 align:middle line:84%
So actually, there
was a story behind it.

00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So when they
invented this method,

00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:49.160 align:middle line:84%
they actually wanted to
quantize not this Maxwell

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:54.320 align:middle line:84%
theory, this non-Abelian
Yang-Mills theory, which later

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:57.090 align:middle line:90%
will become the standard model.

00:50:57.090 --> 00:51:00.440 align:middle line:84%
It becomes standard model of
particle physics, electroweak

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:02.520 align:middle line:90%
theory, QCD, et cetera.

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:04.370 align:middle line:84%
But when they worked
on Yang-Mills theory,

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Yang-Mills theory was some small
corner of mathematical physics.

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:10.595 align:middle line:90%
Nobody cared.

00:51:10.595 --> 00:51:12.290 align:middle line:84%
So when they
invented this method,

00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:15.140 align:middle line:90%
nobody really paid attention.

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:17.190 align:middle line:90%
Nobody really paid attention.

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:23.090 align:middle line:84%
But then, in 1971, 't Hooft,
who was a 21-year-old,

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:25.970 align:middle line:84%
like a graduate
student, then he used

00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:30.920 align:middle line:84%
that, which quantized
the non-Abelian gauge

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:33.620 align:middle line:90%
theory coupled to Higgs.

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:37.370 align:middle line:84%
So before that, people thought
that theory was inconsistent.

00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:39.200 align:middle line:84%
But then he used
this path integral

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.340 align:middle line:90%
to quantize that theory.

00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And so that was a triumph,
for which 't Hooft got a Nobel

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Prize a number of years ago.

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And when 't Hooft came
out using this method,

00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:52.380 align:middle line:84%
nobody could
understand it in US.

00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:54.930 align:middle line:90%


00:51:54.930 --> 00:52:01.610 align:middle line:84%
People like Weinberg, who wrote
the electroweak theory, which

00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:05.470 align:middle line:84%
't Hooft quantized, he
couldn't understand it.

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's only one
person, one person who

00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:11.340 align:middle line:90%
could understand it in the US.

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:17.550 align:middle line:84%
He was an assistant
professor at Stony Brook.

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:20.790 align:middle line:84%
So he started his assistant
professor going to Stony Brook,

00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:24.510 align:middle line:84%
and in Stony Brook, there was
a big shot, the Nobel Prize

00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:27.550 align:middle line:84%
winner, C.N. Yang, who invented
this Yang-Mills theory.

00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:31.710 align:middle line:84%
So he was asking Yang, oh, what
should I do for my research,

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:35.100 align:middle line:84%
ask for a Nobel Prize
winner for advice.

00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And Yang said, maybe you can
look at this Faddeev-Popov

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:39.010 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And then it turned
out later only

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.560 align:middle line:84%
himself could understand
't Hooft's paper.

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.150 align:middle line:90%
And then he made it--

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:47.430 align:middle line:84%
of course, he also did
some other good stuff.

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:54.400 align:middle line:84%
But immediately, he became the
only person everybody went to

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.590 align:middle line:84%
because he really
understood the story.

00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:57.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, anyway.

00:52:57.310 --> 00:53:00.265 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so it's an actually very
interesting story behind this.

00:53:00.265 --> 00:53:03.460 align:middle line:90%


00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:07.960 align:middle line:84%
So first, we have to actually
modify this Lorenz gauge

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:11.030 align:middle line:90%
condition a little bit.

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:15.230 align:middle line:84%
So rather than writing
as partial mu A mu,

00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:27.080 align:middle line:84%
let's try to impose the
gauge partial mu A mu equal

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:34.280 align:middle line:84%
to some arbitrary function
Bx, because partial mu a mu

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:38.000 align:middle line:90%
will give some trajectory here.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.422 align:middle line:84%
But if I choose some
arbitrary function Bx,

00:53:41.422 --> 00:53:44.570 align:middle line:84%
it will just give you
some other trajectory.

00:53:44.570 --> 00:53:46.760 align:middle line:90%
It's still some trajectory.

00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So what Bx you choose
doesn't matter.

00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:56.270 align:middle line:84%
So you can just replace this
delta function partial mu

00:53:56.270 --> 00:54:04.240 align:middle line:84%
A mu here by delta
partial mu A mu Bx.

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.580 align:middle line:84%
So this is the first
non-trivial step.

00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:09.400 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:12.830 align:middle line:84%
So this will give you
some other trajectory.

00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:17.360 align:middle line:84%
So now, since the
Bx does not matter--

00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:19.310 align:middle line:84%
OK, since the Bx
does not matter,

00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:23.080 align:middle line:84%
we can actually
integrate over Bx.

00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:27.910 align:middle line:90%
And then the next step is to--

00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:31.580 align:middle line:90%
so first you replace that.

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:33.020 align:middle line:90%
So this is the first step.

00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And then the next step
is that you replace Z

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:56.700 align:middle line:84%
by you integrate over Bx with
a measure B squared x, and then

00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:01.560 align:middle line:90%
original Z. So original ZJ.

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:06.100 align:middle line:90%


00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:13.950 align:middle line:84%
We can now depend on B because
I have replaced this condition.

00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And now since this
B does not matter,

00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:22.290 align:middle line:84%
so I can just integrate over
B with some arbitrary measure

00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:23.940 align:middle line:90%
you want.

00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:25.410 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:30.310 align:middle line:84%
The only thing this does is just
give you an infinite constant.

00:55:30.310 --> 00:55:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Again, we don't care--
infinite constant.

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:42.570 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this gives you
some infinite constant

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:47.370 align:middle line:84%
since this thing is supposed
to not be dependent on B.

00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:53.340 align:middle line:84%
But this, actually, is very
useful because the reason

00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:57.390 align:middle line:84%
we do this is because now, when
we do this, the path integral

00:55:57.390 --> 00:56:02.200 align:middle line:84%
will become the following,
become DB DA mu.

00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Now we have delta
partial mu A mu minus Bx.

00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:10.890 align:middle line:90%


00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And then we have exponential
i S, then minus this i xi 1/2

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:18.675 align:middle line:90%
B square.

00:56:18.675 --> 00:56:22.530 align:middle line:90%


00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And then I have this i J dot
A. So now you see the benefit,

00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:36.454 align:middle line:84%
because now I have
integration over B.

00:56:36.454 --> 00:56:41.330 align:middle line:84%
But the appears very simply
in the delta function.

00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:43.750 align:middle line:84%
So now I can evaluate
the delta function

00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:51.440 align:middle line:84%
by using the integral of B,
by using the integral of B.

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:53.780 align:middle line:84%
So now I can just
straightforwardly do

00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:54.440 align:middle line:90%
the B integral.

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:59.050 align:middle line:90%


00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:00.255 align:middle line:90%
So now I get a new action.

00:57:00.255 --> 00:57:06.186 align:middle line:90%


00:57:06.186 --> 00:57:16.650 align:middle line:84%
i S xi plus i J dot A.
And now this i S xi--

00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:26.280 align:middle line:84%
so this S xi just given by your
original Maxwell, then minus xi

00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:31.110 align:middle line:90%
over 2 partial mu a mu squared.

00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:34.230 align:middle line:90%


00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:36.150 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:39.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is the reason
we put B square here,

00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:42.810 align:middle line:84%
is that when we evaluate
the B integral, then

00:57:42.810 --> 00:57:45.770 align:middle line:90%
we get something quadratic.

00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:48.090 align:middle line:90%
And now we have that.

00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And now you see this
action is precisely

00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:57.570 align:middle line:90%
this action we have there.

00:57:57.570 --> 00:58:00.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's precisely that
action given there.

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:04.080 align:middle line:84%
So we also derive it
using path integral.

00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:07.170 align:middle line:84%
We also derive it using path
integral, using this trick.

00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:12.410 align:middle line:90%


00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:13.640 align:middle line:90%
So now we just have this.

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:16.270 align:middle line:90%


00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:17.800 align:middle line:90%
Now we just have this.

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:23.178 align:middle line:84%
And now we can straightforwardly
calculate-- now we

00:58:23.178 --> 00:58:25.470 align:middle line:84%
can straightforwardly calculate
this Gaussian integral.

00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:32.740 align:middle line:90%


00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:33.250 align:middle line:90%
One second.

00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:37.008 align:middle line:90%


00:58:37.008 --> 00:58:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, now we can just
straightforwardly calculate

00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:39.633 align:middle line:90%
this integral.

00:58:39.633 --> 00:59:05.260 align:middle line:90%


00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:14.490 align:middle line:84%
By the way, the reason I say
the story here is trivial,

00:59:14.490 --> 00:59:17.060 align:middle line:84%
it's a little bit of
killing a bird with--

00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:19.580 align:middle line:84%
it's because for
the Maxwell case,

00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:22.010 align:middle line:84%
this Jacobian is
actually trivial.

00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:23.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a constant.

00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:25.340 align:middle line:84%
But if you do it for a
non-Abelian gauge theory,

00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:28.430 align:middle line:84%
say, for the electroweak
theory or for QCD,

00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:30.980 align:middle line:84%
this Jacobian is
highly non-trivial.

00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And part of this
trick is also how

00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:37.520 align:middle line:84%
to treat this Jacobian, which
we don't have to do here.

00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:40.550 align:middle line:84%
So here we have a
much simpler story.

00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So now we can just look at
this path integral, which

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.300 align:middle line:84%
now S xi become invertible,
because we already know

00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:49.730 align:middle line:90%
from here this is invertible.

00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:52.010 align:middle line:84%
At least for xi equal
to 1, given by this,

00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:54.080 align:middle line:90%
this is invertible.

00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:58.290 align:middle line:90%
So you can actually now invert.

00:59:58.290 --> 01:00:12.220 align:middle line:84%
So now we can write this S xi is
equal to 1/2 d4x A mu x K mu --

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:16.870 align:middle line:90%
K mu nu xi x minus y A nu y.

01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:19.920 align:middle line:90%


01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.220 align:middle line:90%
And this K mu nu--

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:25.680 align:middle line:90%


01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:30.630 align:middle line:84%
yeah, K mu nu just whatever
you get from that thing,

01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:32.370 align:middle line:84%
just whatever you
get from that thing.

01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And then the K mu mu
now is invertible.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And then you find this thing
just becomes some constant,

01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:58.060 align:middle line:84%
then exponential i d4x
d4y J mu x, then K xi

01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:05.780 align:middle line:90%
minus 1 mu nu x minus 1 J nu y.

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:07.550 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And again, this inverse gives
you the Feynman function.

01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:14.230 align:middle line:90%


01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Again, this gives you
the Feynman function.

01:01:18.070 --> 01:01:21.730 align:middle line:90%
So the K xi minus 1 mu mu--

01:01:21.730 --> 01:01:24.500 align:middle line:90%


01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:25.280 align:middle line:90%
or mu nu.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:30.770 align:middle line:90%


01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so we're not
going into detail here.

01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:34.380 align:middle line:90%
The story is straightforward.

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So this should correspond
to the Feynman function

01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:48.290 align:middle line:90%
for the two gauge fields.

01:01:48.290 --> 01:01:56.977 align:middle line:90%


01:01:56.977 --> 01:01:59.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, this should correspond
to the Feynman function

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:02.250 align:middle line:90%
of these two gauge fields.

01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:05.410 align:middle line:84%
So now let me just
write down the answer.

01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:09.910 align:middle line:84%
So I urge you to check
it yourself explicitly.

01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:13.900 align:middle line:84%
So you can easily write
down what is K mu nu here.

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And then you need to write
down what is K mu nu here,

01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and then you can write
down what is the K minus 1.

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:30.280 align:middle line:84%
So let me just write down
the answer, which we actually

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:34.780 align:middle line:84%
will use later for the
Feynman diagram calculation.

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:43.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you can show this given
by a momentum space minus i k

01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:45.090 align:middle line:90%
squared minus i epsilon.

01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Remember, now,
here it's massless.

01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:51.070 align:middle line:90%
And you have eta mu nu minus--

01:02:51.070 --> 01:03:00.840 align:middle line:84%
plus xi minus 1 k mu k
nu divided by k squared.

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:04.550 align:middle line:90%


01:03:04.550 --> 01:03:08.620 align:middle line:84%
So you can work out the
inverse given by this.

01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And so this can also be written
in terms to the minus i k

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:17.945 align:middle line:90%
squared plus i epsilon.

01:03:17.945 --> 01:03:23.160 align:middle line:90%


01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.770 align:middle line:84%
You can write it in terms of
this transverse projector,

01:03:25.770 --> 01:03:37.760 align:middle line:84%
k mu mu t, then
plus xi P mu nu L.

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:45.120 align:middle line:84%
So P mu nu L is the
longitudinal projector.

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:51.900 align:middle line:84%
You just define it by k mu
k nu divided by k squared.

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:53.520 align:middle line:90%
That's divided by k squared.

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:56.740 align:middle line:90%


01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:58.715 align:middle line:84%
So this is an
answer very simple.

01:03:58.715 --> 01:04:01.310 align:middle line:90%


01:04:01.310 --> 01:04:04.860 align:middle line:90%
So now the interesting thing--

01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:06.750 align:middle line:84%
the two interesting
things here--

01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:11.985 align:middle line:90%


01:04:11.985 --> 01:04:13.360 align:middle line:84%
so let me just
make some remarks.

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:20.580 align:middle line:90%


01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:31.900 align:middle line:84%
So first, if you look
at xi equal to 1,

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:35.530 align:middle line:84%
then this term
vanishes, and then

01:04:35.530 --> 01:04:40.210 align:middle line:84%
you just have eta mu divided
by k squared minus i epsilon.

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:44.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's exactly what
we expect from here.

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:51.050 align:middle line:84%
So here, you just essentially
have the massless 1 over k

01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:55.480 align:middle line:84%
square propagator for
the massless particle.

01:04:55.480 --> 01:05:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And then you have eta mu mu
from the Lorenz signature.

01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:05.605 align:middle line:84%
So for eta equal to 1-- xi equal
to 1, indeed we covered that.

01:05:05.605 --> 01:05:08.570 align:middle line:90%


01:05:08.570 --> 01:05:10.855 align:middle line:84%
So comment is that
when xi is equal to 0.

01:05:10.855 --> 01:05:14.740 align:middle line:90%


01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:17.530 align:middle line:84%
so this is just proportional
to the transverse projector.

01:05:17.530 --> 01:05:21.240 align:middle line:90%


01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.510 align:middle line:90%
To the transverse projector.

01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:28.410 align:middle line:84%
But remember, the
original Maxwell action,

01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:29.820 align:middle line:90%
we used xi equal to 0.

01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:31.290 align:middle line:90%
Actually, that's not invertible.

01:05:31.290 --> 01:05:34.110 align:middle line:90%


01:05:34.110 --> 01:05:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So here, we're actually
doing a different order.

01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:39.180 align:middle line:90%
We first take a nonzero xi.

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:40.680 align:middle line:90%
We invert it.

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And then you can set
actually xi equal to 0.

01:05:43.350 --> 01:05:44.920 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's still works.

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And then xi equal to 0 still
works, because we already

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.010 align:middle line:90%
fixed the gauge.

01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:53.232 align:middle line:90%
We already fixed the gauge.

01:05:53.232 --> 01:05:54.440 align:middle line:90%
So this is the second remark.

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:59.500 align:middle line:90%


01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And then the Wick's
theorem for A mu

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.540 align:middle line:84%
just immediately
follows from here.

01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:18.391 align:middle line:84%
Just as in the case for the
scalars and the fermions,

01:06:18.391 --> 01:06:19.750 align:middle line:90%
it immediately follows.

01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:28.240 align:middle line:90%


01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:29.090 align:middle line:90%
You just contract.

01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:33.020 align:middle line:84%
We all get these Feynman
functions between them.

01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:33.652 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:06:33.652 --> 01:06:35.110 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: How
difficult would it be

01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:37.840 align:middle line:84%
to show that the path
integral approach

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and the canonical approach
are equivalent for the vector?

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:50.630 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Oh, no, it's not
difficult. One simple thing--

01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:55.700 align:middle line:84%
this one point I'm going
to make a little bit later,

01:06:55.700 --> 01:07:01.760 align:middle line:84%
in a few minutes later,
and actually for--

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:04.430 align:middle line:84%
yeah, let me make some
comment a little bit later.

01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they are
completely equivalent.

01:07:06.410 --> 01:07:08.570 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: It just seems
a little not obvious

01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:11.290 align:middle line:90%
at first glance from the gauge.

01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:12.290 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Right, right.

01:07:12.290 --> 01:07:13.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:17.940 align:middle line:84%
So for what we want
to do, it's actually

01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:23.560 align:middle line:84%
a little bit simpler, for
reasons I'm going to mention.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.160 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:25.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:32.900 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:37.180 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's
because a projector is just

01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:40.170 align:middle line:90%
a very simple way to--

01:07:40.170 --> 01:07:45.740 align:middle line:90%
so this is just--

01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:49.750 align:middle line:84%
so by definition, this
is symmetric, in mu nu.

01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:52.720 align:middle line:84%
This definition is
symmetric in mu nu,

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:56.650 align:middle line:84%
because under time ordering,
you can just exchange them.

01:07:56.650 --> 01:08:00.670 align:middle line:84%
That means that in terms
of Lorentz indices,

01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:04.330 align:middle line:84%
you must be able to expand it
in some symmetric tensors built

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:07.400 align:middle line:90%
from k mu.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Because k mu is the
only vector here.

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:13.270 align:middle line:84%
So that means you have to
build this symmetric tensor

01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:16.120 align:middle line:90%
from just eta mu mu and k mu.

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:21.399 align:middle line:84%
And the transverse and the
longitudinal projectors

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:25.540 align:middle line:84%
are just the tensors
you can build from k mu.

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:26.595 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:08:26.595 --> 01:08:27.970 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Until
we fix the gauge,

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:30.609 align:middle line:84%
we still have these
parameters xi we still

01:08:30.609 --> 01:08:32.590 align:middle line:90%
have a family of actions.

01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:34.257 align:middle line:84%
Is that the residual
gauge freedom?

01:08:34.257 --> 01:08:34.840 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: No.

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:36.590 align:middle line:84%
No, that's not the
residual gauge freedom.

01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Just so you can show that the
physics are independent of xi.

01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:41.665 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can take
xi to be any value.

01:08:41.665 --> 01:08:45.250 align:middle line:90%


01:08:45.250 --> 01:08:46.420 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:47.800 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:48.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:51.720 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:53.819 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Good,
good, good, good.

01:08:53.819 --> 01:08:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that's the comment
I'm going to make later.

01:08:56.310 --> 01:08:57.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's coming.

01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:02.670 align:middle line:84%
That's a good question, which
I'm going to make later.

01:09:02.670 --> 01:09:05.149 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let me just
make this comment

01:09:05.149 --> 01:09:07.520 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll be clear.

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.130 align:middle line:84%
I need to make
one comment first.

01:09:09.130 --> 01:09:13.170 align:middle line:90%


01:09:13.170 --> 01:09:18.060 align:middle line:84%
So now, for various
physical processes

01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:22.649 align:middle line:84%
which we will
consider later, we are

01:09:22.649 --> 01:09:26.640 align:middle line:84%
interested in the
following thing.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:29.130 align:middle line:84%
So now we can just
generalize immediately.

01:09:29.130 --> 01:09:41.729 align:middle line:90%


01:09:41.729 --> 01:09:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Now we can just consider an
interacting theory of A mu psi

01:09:56.570 --> 01:09:58.790 align:middle line:90%
and phi.

01:09:58.790 --> 01:10:01.410 align:middle line:90%
OK, so A mu will be the Maxwell.

01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:02.660 align:middle line:90%
This will be some Dirac field.

01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:06.510 align:middle line:84%
This will be some scalar field
or even multiples of them.

01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:13.460 align:middle line:84%
So for any such theory, we
know how to compute the vacuum

01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:14.335 align:middle line:90%
correlation function.

01:10:14.335 --> 01:10:17.200 align:middle line:90%


01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Then just what we did before
just immediately follows,

01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:34.910 align:middle line:84%
just D phi then x
exponential i S phi, and then

01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:37.820 align:middle line:90%
D phi exponential i S.

01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:41.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, so again, I always use
omega to denote the vacuum

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.360 align:middle line:90%
of the interacting theory.

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, again,
you can rewrite this

01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:48.980 align:middle line:90%
as a theory of free theory.

01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Now this becomes,
in the free theory,

01:10:51.170 --> 01:11:03.487 align:middle line:84%
0 Tx exponential i interacting
part 0, and the 0 exponential T

01:11:03.487 --> 01:11:07.280 align:middle line:90%
SI 0.

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:09.680 align:middle line:84%
So now, again, for any
interacting theory,

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.690 align:middle line:84%
we can just use
the same procedure,

01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:14.675 align:middle line:84%
and then we can just
do Feynman diagrams.

01:11:14.675 --> 01:11:16.050 align:middle line:84%
You can just do
Feynman diagrams.

01:11:16.050 --> 01:11:24.770 align:middle line:90%


01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:25.270 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:31.020 align:middle line:90%


01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:36.120 align:middle line:90%
And then the Feynman rule--

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:39.845 align:middle line:90%
we can just do Feynman diagrams.

01:11:39.845 --> 01:11:42.910 align:middle line:90%


01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And the Feynman
rules just follow.

01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:56.910 align:middle line:90%


01:11:56.910 --> 01:12:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So now, as you
already asked, this

01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:06.460 align:middle line:84%
sounds a little bit too
simple, because we just

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:07.495 align:middle line:90%
look at this action--

01:12:07.495 --> 01:12:10.980 align:middle line:90%


01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:14.110 align:middle line:84%
we just look at
this action, but we

01:12:14.110 --> 01:12:19.680 align:middle line:84%
haven't done what we promised
you would do in your Pset.

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Because by doing this,
we say you haven't--

01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:27.360 align:middle line:84%
you really have not completely
fixed the imposed partial mu

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:30.000 align:middle line:90%
A mu yet.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.090 align:middle line:84%
So remember, we said
that when you have this,

01:12:34.090 --> 01:12:37.135 align:middle line:84%
that will lead to
this kind of equation.

01:12:37.135 --> 01:12:43.230 align:middle line:90%


01:12:43.230 --> 01:12:46.110 align:middle line:84%
You still have to impose the
boundary conditions to impose

01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:48.150 align:middle line:90%
the partial mu A mu equal to 0.

01:12:48.150 --> 01:12:51.690 align:middle line:84%
But now it seems like we are
not doing anything like that.

01:12:51.690 --> 01:12:53.190 align:middle line:84%
We are not doing
anything like that.

01:12:53.190 --> 01:12:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And also, it seems like we are
not fixing the residual gauge

01:12:56.190 --> 01:12:58.110 align:middle line:90%
freedom.

01:12:58.110 --> 01:13:00.070 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we do it?

01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:04.980 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have to do
it because, here, we

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:09.000 align:middle line:84%
are only interested in
calculating the vacuum

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.810 align:middle line:90%
correlation functions.

01:13:10.810 --> 01:13:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And the vacuum is
automatically a physical state.

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:17.290 align:middle line:84%
As you will see in
your Pset, the vacuum

01:13:17.290 --> 01:13:19.090 align:middle line:90%
is automatic physical state.

01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And so it's already
a physical state.

01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:26.390 align:middle line:84%
So in the vacuum, all
those unphysical degrees

01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:28.480 align:middle line:84%
of freedon just
automatically will decouple.

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:31.180 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
worry about them.

01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why-- but
if you're interested

01:13:33.130 --> 01:13:36.400 align:middle line:84%
in the excited states, then you
have to go through the exactly

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:39.070 align:middle line:84%
the same kind of
procedure to get rid of--

01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:44.020 align:middle line:84%
to do a more complicated thing,
as you would do in your Pset.

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:48.910 align:middle line:84%
But here, since we are
computing just a special class

01:13:48.910 --> 01:13:52.270 align:middle line:84%
of physical quantities,
then just by doing this,

01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:53.500 align:middle line:90%
it's already enough.

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:56.570 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to worry
about other subtle stuff.

01:13:56.570 --> 01:14:00.230 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to worry
about other subtle stuff.

01:14:00.230 --> 01:14:06.970 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I think we are
done for the quantizing

01:14:06.970 --> 01:14:09.250 align:middle line:90%
the Maxwell theory.

01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:11.220 align:middle line:90%
So now we have all our elements.

01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:11.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:15.580 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So when you have like
multiple internal vertices,

01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:17.300 align:middle line:90%
we used to--

01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:20.690 align:middle line:84%
the first interacting
theory, when we had just

01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:21.950 align:middle line:90%
expanded the [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:25.655 align:middle line:90%


01:14:25.655 --> 01:14:27.030 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: You do
the same thing.

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.940 align:middle line:90%
You do the same thing, right?

01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:28.815 align:middle line:90%
You just expand them.

01:14:28.815 --> 01:14:30.780 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: --each
coupling, or like --

01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:32.010 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Just expand S i.

01:14:32.010 --> 01:14:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is in S i, you
just treat them together.

01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:37.350 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I guess,
I think, like,

01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:40.610 align:middle line:84%
earlier in order of whatever
[INAUDIBLE] whatever.

01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:41.420 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:44.900 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: But now is
it order of which--

01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:47.690 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

01:14:47.690 --> 01:14:51.185 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, so normally, we
assume all the coupling

01:14:51.185 --> 01:14:54.890 align:middle line:84%
S I are of the same order, and
then you just expand the S I

01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:56.420 align:middle line:90%
and then-- yeah.

01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:59.670 align:middle line:84%
But indeed, you can see
the special situation.

01:14:59.670 --> 01:15:01.400 align:middle line:84%
You may want to
expand some couplings,

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.080 align:middle line:90%
not expand some other couplings.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Then that depends on
specific situation.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.540 align:middle line:90%


01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:09.500 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:12.120 align:middle line:90%


01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.300 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:17.780 align:middle line:84%
So let's conclude our
discussion of quantizing

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:19.460 align:middle line:90%
of Maxwell's theory.

01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And so now-- so we have
quantized the photon.

01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:29.930 align:middle line:84%
We have quantized the Maxwell's
theory using the Coulomb gauge.

01:15:29.930 --> 01:15:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Then we see the two-photon
degrees of freedom.

01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And then we also did
canonical quantization

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:37.760 align:middle line:84%
for the Lorenz gauge, which
you will finish in your pset.

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And then we also discussed how
to treat it in path integral

01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:45.710 align:middle line:84%
so that you can calculate
these kind of questions,

01:15:45.710 --> 01:15:48.460 align:middle line:84%
so that we can treat
these kind of questions.

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And so now, the next goal-- now
we have all the technicality,

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:55.800 align:middle line:90%
all the tools we need.

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:58.380 align:middle line:90%
Now we can tackle QED.

01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So now, finally,
we can tackle QED.

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So this is the theory of
photon and the electron.

01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:10.670 align:middle line:84%
This is the theory of
photon and electron,

01:16:10.670 --> 01:16:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and so we can consider
the physical process

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:17.150 align:middle line:84%
in this theory, which
A mu and psi are now

01:16:17.150 --> 01:16:19.160 align:middle line:90%
interacting with each other.

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:22.880 align:middle line:84%
A mu and psi are now
interacting with each other.

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.640 align:middle line:90%
So we will start doing it.

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:27.130 align:middle line:90%
I think we are out--

01:16:27.130 --> 01:16:28.820 align:middle line:84%
yeah, we only have
two minutes left.

01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:33.290 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we will finish
a little bit early today.

01:16:33.290 --> 01:16:34.310 align:middle line:90%
OK, yeah.

01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:36.520 align:middle line:90%
So that's all for today.

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:41.000 align:middle line:90%
