[CLICKING]

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.660 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: So again,
let us first recall

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.790 align:middle line:84%
say if we want to calculate
the n-point function

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.170 align:middle line:90%
in the interacting theory.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:33.250 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is given by
this following ratio

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle line:90%
in the free theory.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.120 align:middle line:90%


00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.410 align:middle line:84%
You look at this T,
then you look at this.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Again, take this
product to be X,

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:56.840 align:middle line:84%
take the T X, exponential i
S_I, then in the free theory,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.891 align:middle line:84%
and then divide it
just by time order i

00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:06.650 align:middle line:90%
S_I, in the free theory.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:14.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.390 align:middle line:84%
So then what we do is we just
expand these two exponentials

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.880 align:middle line:90%
in power series.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.950 align:middle line:84%
We expand this exponential
in power series.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And so when you expand
in power series,

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:38.630 align:middle line:84%
then, for example the nth
order term in the upstairs,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:47.570 align:middle line:84%
say upstairs, then have
the following structure.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.250 align:middle line:84%
You have i to the
power n, n factorial.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Then you have T X then
S_I to the power to n S_I.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.040 align:middle line:90%


00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And the nth order
for the downstairs,

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.600 align:middle line:84%
you can also expand
the downstairs.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.340 align:middle line:90%


00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:31.160 align:middle line:84%
So in the downstairs similarly
then you have almost identical

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.560 align:middle line:84%
structure, except you don't
have this X. So you have T,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.517 align:middle line:90%
then you just have n S_I's.

00:02:38.517 --> 00:02:41.810 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.430 align:middle line:90%
So there's n of them.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.322 align:middle line:90%


00:02:47.322 --> 00:02:48.280 align:middle line:90%
So there are n of them.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.250 align:middle line:90%


00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And the last time we
described how to compute

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.030 align:middle line:90%
say a typical terms in here.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Let me call this equation
star, equation star star.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:13.830 align:middle line:84%
So last time we described
the star and the star star

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.840 align:middle line:84%
can be computed
using Wick's theorem.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:29.480 align:middle line:90%


00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.410 align:middle line:84%
But in practice what
we do is that we first

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:46.410 align:middle line:84%
draw Feynman diagrams and then
we convert the Feynman diagrams

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.530 align:middle line:90%
into analytic expressions.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.230 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Normally we go through
this procedure,

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.520 align:middle line:84%
rather than directly do
the Wick contraction.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.465 align:middle line:90%
We mentioned the--

00:04:03.465 --> 00:04:08.460 align:middle line:90%


00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And the second
line, of course, can

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.970 align:middle line:84%
be considered as a special
case of the first line,

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.310 align:middle line:90%
with this x to be identity.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.589 align:middle line:90%
This x to be identity.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:23.320 align:middle line:90%


00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:41.315 align:middle line:84%
So any diagram contributing
to star because the--

00:04:41.315 --> 00:04:43.880 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Sorry I should actually here
I have n, let me call it m.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.785 align:middle line:90%


00:04:51.785 --> 00:04:55.610 align:middle line:84%
I should call it m
so that they don't--

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.980 align:middle line:90%
because we already have n here.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.190 align:middle line:90%


00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:90%
So mth order.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.020 align:middle line:90%


00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.935 align:middle line:84%
Any diagram contributing to
the star has n external legs.

00:05:13.935 --> 00:05:23.090 align:middle line:90%


00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's come just from this
x, from this phi x1 and the phi

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.130 align:middle line:90%
xn.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.040 align:middle line:90%


00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And then also with m
vertices because each vertex

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.630 align:middle line:90%
comes from a power of S_I.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:53.120 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:11.390 align:middle line:84%
But for star star, diagrams
contributing to star star

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:17.200 align:middle line:84%
have no external legs
because there's no x here,

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.070 align:middle line:90%
there's no phi here.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.510 align:middle line:90%
There's no external legs.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:27.400 align:middle line:90%


00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.935 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they're all
called vacuum diagrams.

00:06:29.935 --> 00:06:37.437 align:middle line:90%


00:06:37.437 --> 00:06:38.895 align:middle line:84%
They're called the
vacuum diagrams.

00:06:38.895 --> 00:06:42.600 align:middle line:90%


00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.910 align:middle line:84%
The downstairs can be understood
as in the case which you just

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.390 align:middle line:90%
essentially take X equal to 1.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:07:00.060 align:middle line:84%
So essentially we are
calculating some kind

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.820 align:middle line:90%
of unnormalized transition.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.580 align:middle line:84%
This is the overlap
between the vacuum itself

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.940 align:middle line:84%
from minus infinity
to plus infinity.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:14.970 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:24.900 align:middle line:84%
In Pset 6, just in the Pset
we just posted last night,

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.790 align:middle line:84%
you can show that
this quantity, which

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.790 align:middle line:84%
comes from summing over
all possible vacuum

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:37.860 align:middle line:84%
diagrams, the diagrams
without external legs--

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, I should say
have no external legs.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:90%
This no is very important.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, has no external legs
and so they are called

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:48.265 align:middle line:90%
vacuum diagrams.

00:07:48.265 --> 00:07:50.830 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.410 align:middle line:84%
In Pset 6 you will
show yourself.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a pretty
simple calculation,

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:57.730 align:middle line:90%
but it's an instructive one.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.400 align:middle line:90%


00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:07.090 align:middle line:84%
You can show that
this quantity can

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:27.080 align:middle line:84%
be used to calculate the vacuum
energy of the interacting

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:27.580 align:middle line:90%
theory.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:32.559 align:middle line:84%
Of course, this is divergent,
but just as the vacuum energy

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:37.840 align:middle line:84%
we calculated before
in free theory,

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.409 align:middle line:84%
this one can be used to
calculate the vacuum energy

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:42.790 align:middle line:90%
of the interacting theory.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:53.660 align:middle line:90%


00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Of course, this quantity
you will see its divergent,

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.140 align:middle line:84%
but this is the formal
way to calculate it.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.020 align:middle line:90%


00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And how to remove
the divergences etc.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:12.680 align:middle line:84%
is something we will not
discuss in this class.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.260 align:middle line:90%
It will be in QFT 2.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.250 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:25.600 align:middle line:90%


00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.120 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.695 align:middle line:90%
Let me say a few more words.

00:09:29.695 --> 00:09:34.550 align:middle line:90%


00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:40.860 align:middle line:84%
When we compute
two, there we say

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.480 align:middle line:84%
they can be computed
using the Feynman diagram,

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:48.330 align:middle line:84%
so let me be a little
bit more explicit.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:56.970 align:middle line:84%
The computation of
star or star star

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.380 align:middle line:90%
essentially involves two steps.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:04.850 align:middle line:90%


00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Just elaborate that
remark in the bracket.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:15.735 align:middle line:84%
Is that we first
draw all possible --

00:10:15.735 --> 00:10:21.490 align:middle line:84%
all inequivalent
Feynman diagrams.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:30.730 align:middle line:90%


00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:40.350 align:middle line:84%
In this case, at
each mth order you

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.200 align:middle line:84%
have an n points,
n external points,

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.740 align:middle line:90%
and then you have m vertices.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.340 align:middle line:90%


00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:55.020 align:middle line:84%
There you have say for star you
just have n external points,

00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:00.120 align:middle line:90%
say x1 x2 in coordinate space.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.600 align:middle line:84%
You have n external points
and then you have m vertices.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.050 align:middle line:90%
And at each vertex you have--

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:13.920 align:middle line:90%
let's call it y1, y2, ym--

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and at each vertex you
have four legs coming out.

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:27.680 align:middle line:84%
At each external point you
have one line come out,

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and then you just need to find
all possible ways to connect

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.260 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:38.390 align:middle line:84%
That is what we mean by joining
all inequivalent diagrams.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:42.980 align:middle line:84%
This -- you just draw it,
it becomes mechanical.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:44.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.590 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Why do the vertices
have to all have four legs?

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:51.640 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.640 --> 00:12:01.770 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: More specifically
here we're talking about the S_I

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:07.555 align:middle line:84%
equals to minus
lambda 4 factorial.

00:12:07.555 --> 00:12:09.180 align:middle line:84%
We can see that this
particular theory.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.490 align:middle line:90%


00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:17.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make remarks on
other more general theories,

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:21.570 align:middle line:90%
but here it's more specific.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:22.560 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:28.510 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.490 align:middle line:90%
So this is for star.

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:35.470 align:middle line:84%
So for star star, then
you just don't have the x,

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:36.490 align:middle line:90%
you just have y's.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:41.710 align:middle line:84%
You just have m y's and
each y has four legs.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.770 align:middle line:84%
You just connect all
of them together.

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:47.650 align:middle line:84%
You connect all
of them together.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:51.860 align:middle line:84%
In the star star, in
the vacuum diagrams,

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:55.690 align:middle line:84%
it will be always closed
because there's no external leg.

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Just because all the
legs will be contracted,

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.790 align:middle line:84%
and so it will be
a closed diagram.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's also
called the vacuum bubble.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.755 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we call them vacuum
diagrams or vacuum bubbles.

00:13:05.755 --> 00:13:08.940 align:middle line:90%


00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.555 align:middle line:84%
Here just know it's
always closed diagrams.

00:13:12.555 --> 00:13:24.040 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And the second step
is that now once you

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.480 align:middle line:84%
draw all the
inequivalent diagrams,

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:45.160 align:middle line:84%
then you can just
convert each diagram

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:59.245 align:middle line:84%
to an algebraic expression
using Feynman rules.

00:13:59.245 --> 00:14:09.810 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Then you just sum
all of them together.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Then you sum all
of them together.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And then we talked about
the Feynman rules last time.

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:20.273 align:middle line:84%
There's coordinate space rules,
there's momentum space rules.

00:14:20.273 --> 00:14:21.690 align:middle line:84%
You can do it in
coordinate space,

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.430 align:middle line:90%
you can do it in momentum space.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:26.895 align:middle line:84%
I will not repeat them
here to save time.

00:14:26.895 --> 00:14:30.870 align:middle line:90%


00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Once we finish the
second step, then

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.910 align:middle line:84%
we just have a bunch
of analytic expressions

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:38.910 align:middle line:84%
and then you just need
to do the integrals.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.840 align:middle line:84%
So a bunch of integrals and you
just need to do the integrals.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.130 align:middle line:90%


00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.340 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.590 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.195 align:middle line:90%
Some further remarks on 1.

00:14:52.195 --> 00:14:56.120 align:middle line:90%


00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:06.945 align:middle line:84%
Further remarks on
this first step.

00:15:06.945 --> 00:15:12.020 align:middle line:90%


00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Here I consider a
very special case.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Here I consider a
very special case

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:21.540 align:middle line:84%
corresponding to
this S_I to consist

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.750 align:middle line:90%
of a single term, phi 4.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:38.505 align:middle line:84%
In principle, of course, S_I
can contain multiple terms.

00:15:38.505 --> 00:15:44.710 align:middle line:90%


00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:45.985 align:middle line:90%
Can contain multiple terms.

00:15:45.985 --> 00:15:53.230 align:middle line:90%


00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.960 align:middle line:84%
It can contain
multiple terms, then

00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:01.490 align:middle line:84%
you will have multiple
types of vertices.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:06.600 align:middle line:90%


00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.610 align:middle line:90%
But the rule is similar.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:21.810 align:middle line:84%
You just say suppose
S_I contains two terms,

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:25.380 align:middle line:90%
then you just multiply them.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.167 align:middle line:90%
Then you'll get many terms here.

00:16:28.167 --> 00:16:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Just corresponding to
different combinations

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.380 align:middle line:84%
of vertices for different
types of vertices.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.630 align:middle line:84%
But the rule is
exactly the same,

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.390 align:middle line:84%
just now your diagrams
are more complicated.

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:43.000 align:middle line:90%


00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.020 align:middle line:84%
But essentially
otherwise it's identical.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.920 align:middle line:90%


00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Another thing to mention
is in principle we can also

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.130 align:middle line:90%
have multiple fields.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So here we can see only a
single scalar field, phi,

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:03.200 align:middle line:84%
but you can also, in principle,
consider more than one field.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:16.339 align:middle line:84%
So if there are multiple
fields, the story

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:20.880 align:middle line:84%
is, again, very much parallel,
and the only difference

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:33.550 align:middle line:84%
is that each field,
each propagator,

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.320 align:middle line:84%
is represented by
a different line.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:48.540 align:middle line:90%


00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, these
two steps again apply.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Just now you actually have
different type of lines.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:06.890 align:middle line:90%


00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.890 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you consider a
theory with two scalar fields,

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:20.480 align:middle line:84%
phi 1 phi 2 with S_I
proportional to phi 1

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:26.750 align:middle line:84%
squared phi 2 squared,
and then in this case

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:30.380 align:middle line:84%
you will have a
propagator for phi 1,

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.380 align:middle line:84%
then you also have a
propagator for phi 2.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.730 align:middle line:90%
Now I can use a dashed line.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.672 align:middle line:84%
Then the interacting
vertex then will

00:18:38.672 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:90%
have the following structure.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:48.620 align:middle line:84%
You have two solid lines
and the two dashed lines.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.655 align:middle line:90%
Now that's your vertex.

00:18:49.655 --> 00:18:57.430 align:middle line:90%


00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Again, you just contract
all possible lines

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.720 align:middle line:90%
according to your Feynman rules.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:10.140 align:middle line:90%


00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:10.640 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.920 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Also one remark I
want to emphasize

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:20.975 align:middle line:90%
is that the momentum space--

00:19:20.975 --> 00:19:25.670 align:middle line:90%


00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:30.025 align:middle line:84%
also just another
point to stress--

00:19:30.025 --> 00:19:32.720 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:45.200 align:middle line:84%
this is obtained by
Fourier transform Gn x1 xn

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.600 align:middle line:90%
times the delta function.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:53.740 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:59.110 align:middle line:84%
This times this gives you the
Fourier transform of that.

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:03.970 align:middle line:84%
When you do the Fourier
transform, p1 and pn,

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:07.300 align:middle line:84%
they just come from doing
Fourier transform corresponding

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.190 align:middle line:90%
to momentum for x1, xn.

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:13.990 align:middle line:84%
So here the p1 and pn
are just arbitrary.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:90%


00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:21.070 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to satisfy
any on-shell condition,

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:23.590 align:middle line:84%
they're just arbitrary momentum,
and the only constraint

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:28.630 align:middle line:84%
is that this is non-vanishing
only when sum of them

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:33.790 align:middle line:84%
is equal to 0, otherwise
they can be arbitrary.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:41.040 align:middle line:90%


00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.270 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:46.670 align:middle line:84%
So in practice,
now we have a way

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:50.630 align:middle line:84%
to calculate the diagram for
both upstairs and downstairs,

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:54.020 align:middle line:84%
and now we just
do the expansion.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.240 align:middle line:90%
We just do the expansion.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Now let me summarize the example
we did last time now just only

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.190 align:middle line:90%
using diagrams.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:10.082 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if we consider
the two point function,

00:21:10.082 --> 00:21:11.665 align:middle line:84%
let's consider the
two point function.

00:21:11.665 --> 00:21:17.620 align:middle line:90%


00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:19.990 align:middle line:90%
We have upstairs and downstairs.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:25.430 align:middle line:84%
The upstairs, the lowest order
you just have a single line.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:29.770 align:middle line:84%
It just has a single
line-- x1 to x2.

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:35.450 align:middle line:84%
To save effort we'll also
not label x1, x2 from now on.

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:39.150 align:middle line:90%


00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:44.230 align:middle line:84%
The next order is to bring
down one power of this S_I.

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:48.940 align:middle line:84%
So you bring down one power
of these four indices.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.330 align:middle line:90%
Now there are two possibilities.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.970 align:middle line:84%
One possibility is that
you still have this,

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:59.415 align:middle line:84%
but then times this
vertex contracts itself.

00:21:59.415 --> 00:22:03.070 align:middle line:90%


00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And then another
possibility is that you

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.740 align:middle line:90%
have something like this.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And you contract
with the vertex,

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.650 align:middle line:84%
so this is the plus
lambda squared.

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:25.710 align:middle line:90%
This is to lambda order.

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And downstairs you have 1
and then we just essentially

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:35.790 align:middle line:90%
have a single S_I.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:39.380 align:middle line:84%
A single S_I, the
only contraction

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.370 align:middle line:90%
is just given by this.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.680 align:middle line:90%


00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And then plus order
lambda squared.

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:48.810 align:middle line:90%
Plus order lambda squared.

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:59.730 align:middle line:90%


00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:02.010 align:middle line:90%
So now each vertex carry--

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:03.510 align:middle line:84%
so you should
remember, each vertex

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:06.130 align:middle line:84%
carries a parameter
lambda, a factor of lambda,

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:09.240 align:middle line:90%
which is considered to be small.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Downstairs you have
1 plus order lambda,

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.530 align:middle line:84%
and in the downstairs
then we have

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:16.900 align:middle line:84%
1 plus this power
series of lambda,

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.840 align:middle line:84%
and then we can do the
Taylor expansion again

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.420 align:middle line:90%
to bring them to the upstairs.

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:24.270 align:middle line:90%
Remember we did before.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Now if you do that, then
at leading order to lambda,

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:32.310 align:middle line:84%
then we still just have
x1, x2 because this divided

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:35.220 align:middle line:84%
by that just x1, x2, and
then you have this term.

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:40.290 align:middle line:90%


00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:44.760 align:middle line:84%
But now we can bring this
term to the upstairs and then

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.490 align:middle line:90%
this sign changes to minus sign.

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:49.410 align:middle line:84%
This term can
multiply that and then

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:50.535 align:middle line:90%
you get the term like that.

00:23:50.535 --> 00:23:53.470 align:middle line:90%


00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Coming from bringing
this term to upstairs

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:58.870 align:middle line:90%
and then you have this term.

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:01.790 align:middle line:90%


00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And the rest, they're
all order lambda squared.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:09.080 align:middle line:84%
So you can also have this change
to minus sign, multiply that,

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.720 align:middle line:84%
but that will be
order lambda squared.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And since here we already
neglected lambda squared

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:18.260 align:middle line:84%
and here neglect
is lambda squared,

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.570 align:middle line:90%
so we don't worry about it.

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And if do this
and multiply this,

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:24.470 align:middle line:90%
also gives you lambda squared.

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Up to order lambda
and that you have.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And then as we discussed
before, these two cancel.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:38.980 align:middle line:84%
So in the end you just have
two diagrams, just one and then

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:39.490 align:middle line:90%
this one.

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:45.020 align:middle line:90%


00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:49.760 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: If we have
two fields with a vertex

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.000 align:middle line:84%
with like one solid
line, one dashed line.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Here, you can read it as the two
different particles interacting

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:58.880 align:middle line:84%
with each other or
the same species

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.310 align:middle line:84%
interacting with each other
if you read it like that,

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:04.078 align:middle line:90%
but you lose that if you--

00:25:04.078 --> 00:25:05.620 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: For here
it doesn't matter.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.140 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it doesn't
matter how you draw them.

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.595 align:middle line:90%
You mean if I exchange them?

00:25:09.595 --> 00:25:10.220 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.637 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah,
it doesn't matter.

00:25:11.637 --> 00:25:14.500 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: But in that
picture you can't read--

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.898 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, normally you
cannot view up and up and down.

00:25:17.898 --> 00:25:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Left and right here
does not mean anything.

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:22.810 align:middle line:90%


00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:26.740 align:middle line:90%
The order is not important.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:34.030 align:middle line:84%
But actually, in QFT 2, you
will encounter situations

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:36.240 align:middle line:84%
which these are
matrices and then

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.700 align:middle line:90%
the order becomes important.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.390 align:middle line:84%
But here they just fields
because they commute.

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.800 align:middle line:84%
So no matter how you
order them doesn't matter.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.110 align:middle line:90%
They're just ordinary fields.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:51.390 align:middle line:90%


00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:55.590 align:middle line:84%
This order, we just
have these two diagrams.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:58.350 align:middle line:84%
This is much simpler than
we did at the first time.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Much simpler than we did the
first time and the calculation

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:04.010 align:middle line:90%
is much easier.

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Let me just show you the
cancellation in a slightly

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:09.170 align:middle line:84%
different way, almost
identical, but I

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.900 align:middle line:90%
write slightly differently.

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Alternatively, I can
also write as this.

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:18.560 align:middle line:90%


00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.620 align:middle line:90%
I can also write G2.

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:25.210 align:middle line:90%
We look at these two terms.

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:28.310 align:middle line:84%
We can just take a
common factor out.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:30.250 align:middle line:84%
So the upstairs,
the first two terms

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:34.570 align:middle line:84%
I can also write
it as this times 1

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:42.350 align:middle line:84%
plus this thing
and then plus this.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And downstairs I just
have plus lambda squared.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.640 align:middle line:90%
And downstairs I just have 1.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:27:00.930 align:middle line:90%


00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Now you can just
look at these two.

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.235 align:middle line:84%
You can directly see, actually,
these two can be canceled.

00:27:05.235 --> 00:27:07.747 align:middle line:90%


00:27:07.747 --> 00:27:09.330 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
worry about this one

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:16.250 align:middle line:84%
because when these multiplied
by that, you get higher orders.

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Now you just directly
also get from here.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:29.860 align:middle line:90%


00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:36.520 align:middle line:84%
The reason I'm doing these
in these two different ways

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:41.110 align:middle line:84%
is that this cancellation
is actually not an accident.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:44.185 align:middle line:84%
Such cancellation, this
is not an accident.

00:27:44.185 --> 00:27:50.570 align:middle line:90%


00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.210 align:middle line:90%
This is not accident.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:55.540 align:middle line:84%
This actually happens
to all orders.

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:58.780 align:middle line:84%
This happens to all orders,
so you can actually show.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:15.550 align:middle line:90%


00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:23.920 align:middle line:84%
If I call the
upstairs, now let's

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:30.265 align:middle line:84%
call the upstairs to be
Un and this to be U0.

00:28:30.265 --> 00:28:33.430 align:middle line:90%


00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Un is just the upstairs
U0 is the downstairs.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:44.110 align:middle line:84%
The Un, by definition,
corresponding

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:59.145 align:middle line:84%
to sum over all Feynman
diagrams with n external legs.

00:28:59.145 --> 00:29:06.850 align:middle line:90%


00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And U0, by definition, is
sum of all Feynman diagrams

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.460 align:middle line:90%
with zero external legs.

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.320 align:middle line:90%


00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.690 align:middle line:90%
With zero external legs.

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:26.500 align:middle line:90%


00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:31.540 align:middle line:84%
So then you can show
in general which

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:38.980 align:middle line:84%
the Gn is just equal to, as we
wrote there, just Un over U0.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:44.200 align:middle line:84%
You can show that this
defined to be Un over U0.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.980 align:middle line:90%


00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:52.660 align:middle line:84%
You find order, you can show to
all orders this downstairs can

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:53.935 align:middle line:90%
always, always cancel.

00:29:53.935 --> 00:29:57.280 align:middle line:90%


00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:03.410 align:middle line:84%
The statement is that
this is equal to sum over

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:23.360 align:middle line:84%
the ratio of all diagrams
of n external legs,

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:34.635 align:middle line:90%
but without any vacuum bubbles.

00:30:34.635 --> 00:30:48.830 align:middle line:90%


00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:50.960 align:middle line:84%
Now let me just explain
what this means that

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.430 align:middle line:90%
without any vacuum bubbles.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:31:02.580 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this diagram
is a diagram which

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:07.920 align:middle line:84%
contains just a straight
propagator times a bubble.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.770 align:middle line:84%
This diagram contains
a vacuum bubble.

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:14.640 align:middle line:84%
It contains a vacuum diagram,
and this diagram does not.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.370 align:middle line:84%
This diagram is
connected to itself.

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:21.030 align:middle line:90%


00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, when you
go to next order,

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:29.440 align:middle line:84%
as we discussed last
time, this diagram,

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:35.310 align:middle line:84%
so go to next order
times, so this is also

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:37.350 align:middle line:84%
a diagram with vacuum
bubble because you

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:43.560 align:middle line:84%
have this part, which does
not have any external legs.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.500 align:middle line:90%
This will not arise.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:50.820 align:middle line:84%
When you calculate the ratio,
then this kind of diagram

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.830 align:middle line:90%
we automatically don't include.

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Just don't need
to worry about it.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Now when you do the
ratio you can just

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.500 align:middle line:84%
forget about those
diagrams and directly

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.930 align:middle line:84%
write down those diagrams
without vacuum bubbles.

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:10.420 align:middle line:84%
That just a greatly
simplifies your life.

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.280 align:middle line:90%
OK One second.

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:19.310 align:middle line:90%
So this statement is simply--

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:22.100 align:middle line:90%


00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.650 align:middle line:84%
If you think a
little bit, then you

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:28.370 align:middle line:84%
will see that this
cancellation is generic--

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:31.760 align:middle line:84%
actually will work
through all orders--

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:35.870 align:middle line:84%
and this thinking process is
actually quite instructive,

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:38.810 align:middle line:90%
so this is left as a homework.

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:40.700 align:middle line:84%
You can read the
part in Peskin which

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.060 align:middle line:84%
tries to explain
this cancellation,

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.770 align:middle line:84%
but that discussion
is actually not great.

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:49.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not great, that
discussion, but you can still

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:52.040 align:middle line:90%
read it and get the main idea.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:55.835 align:middle line:84%
And so in homework I ask
you to show this yourself.

00:32:55.835 --> 00:32:58.470 align:middle line:90%


00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:00.300 align:middle line:84%
It's not difficult
once you get the idea.

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:05.750 align:middle line:84%
It's actually pretty simple to
see and will be illuminating.

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:06.845 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:33:06.845 --> 00:33:08.970 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I'm pretty confused
on this cancellation.

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:12.330 align:middle line:84%
So if you're pulling out
an order lambda term,

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:16.175 align:middle line:84%
won't your order lambda squared
would now be order lambda?

00:33:16.175 --> 00:33:18.175 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: No, you pull
the whole thing together.

00:33:18.175 --> 00:33:22.060 align:middle line:90%


00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:25.015 align:middle line:84%
Those terms don't
matter at this order.

00:33:25.015 --> 00:33:28.660 align:middle line:90%


00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Whatever here, when
you cancel them,

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:35.320 align:middle line:84%
you cancel the whole thing,
this term doesn't matter.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:39.790 align:middle line:84%
If you care only of all
the lambda squared terms,

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:41.860 align:middle line:84%
and then you can just
directly cancel these two.

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.400 align:middle line:90%


00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.775 align:middle line:84%
You can easily
convince yourself.

00:33:45.775 --> 00:33:48.578 align:middle line:90%


00:33:48.578 --> 00:33:49.870 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to do a diagram.

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Just write something-- a 1 plus
lambda plus some other lambda

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:56.617 align:middle line:90%
and 1 plus--

00:33:56.617 --> 00:33:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, you can just
convince yourself

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.630 align:middle line:90%
that this always happens.

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:01.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:05.010 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So this
cancellation, does it just

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.140 align:middle line:84%
come out of the math
or does it is there

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:10.815 align:middle line:90%
like a physical interpretation?

00:34:10.815 --> 00:34:12.940 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, there is
a physical interpretation.

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:16.239 align:middle line:84%
Essentially you just
say when you look at--

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:19.360 align:middle line:84%
So this kind of
thing essentially

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:23.590 align:middle line:84%
comes from the
normalization of your state.

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:26.500 align:middle line:84%
This thing is just
pure vacuum process

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.792 align:middle line:84%
and just comes from
normalization of the states.

00:34:28.792 --> 00:34:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And when you
normalize your states,

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:34.242 align:middle line:84%
they just should not contribute
to your correlation functions.

00:34:34.242 --> 00:34:35.409 align:middle line:90%
Just roughly it's like that.

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:39.750 align:middle line:90%


00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:40.699 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:44.239 align:middle line:90%


00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:46.389 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Now let's just put
this in practice.

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Let's put this in
practice, and let

00:34:51.860 --> 00:35:00.480 align:middle line:84%
me just write down
the most general,

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.525 align:middle line:90%
all the diagrams for G2.

00:35:03.525 --> 00:35:13.020 align:middle line:90%


00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:16.470 align:middle line:90%
To lambda squared order.

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Now let's look at G2 to
lambda squared order.

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:22.575 align:middle line:84%
We have already found
the lambda order.

00:35:22.575 --> 00:35:25.630 align:middle line:90%


00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Lambda squared order, we
already drew a bunch of diagrams

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:34.270 align:middle line:84%
last time, so you only need
to keep those which don't

00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:35.635 align:middle line:90%
include these vacuum bubbles.

00:35:35.635 --> 00:35:38.440 align:middle line:90%


00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.200 align:middle line:90%
Let me just write them down.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Including this, including that,
and also including the one

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:51.180 align:middle line:90%
I forgot last time--

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:53.490 align:middle line:90%
this one.

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:54.720 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And if I remember, last time
we drew many more diagrams,

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:01.840 align:middle line:84%
but you don't need to
worry about the others,

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.805 align:middle line:90%
such as diagrams like this.

00:36:03.805 --> 00:36:10.350 align:middle line:90%


00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:11.360 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:16.365 align:middle line:84%
Let's do another example
for the 4 point function.

00:36:16.365 --> 00:36:19.750 align:middle line:90%


00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Now it's become much easier
because you have much fewer

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:27.290 align:middle line:90%
diagrams to consider.

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:30.220 align:middle line:84%
You have much fewer
diagrams to consider.

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:35.290 align:middle line:84%
So at the 4 point
function level,

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:40.240 align:middle line:84%
then you first have
your free theory terms.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.415 align:middle line:84%
So the free theory returns
you just have that.

00:36:42.415 --> 00:36:45.760 align:middle line:90%


00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.230 align:middle line:90%
It just contracted with itself.

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Now we have four
external points.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:54.350 align:middle line:90%


00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:55.910 align:middle line:84%
This is coming from
the free theory

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:57.950 align:middle line:90%
contribution at the 0th order.

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And then the first
order, at order lambda,

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:06.710 align:middle line:84%
you just have this, so that all
the four different phi's from

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:11.870 align:middle line:84%
the vertex are contracted with
each of the external phi's.

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:14.210 align:middle line:90%
This is the first order.

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:20.765 align:middle line:84%
And then you can also
have a diagram like this.

00:37:20.765 --> 00:37:24.930 align:middle line:90%


00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:28.280 align:middle line:90%
And you can also have--

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.655 align:middle line:84%
I will not show
all the diagrams.

00:37:29.655 --> 00:37:32.490 align:middle line:90%


00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And you can draw more
diagrams like this,

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.660 align:middle line:84%
but these are not
vacuum bubbles.

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And you can also have
diagrams like this.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:48.547 align:middle line:90%


00:37:48.547 --> 00:37:50.130 align:middle line:84%
The reason I chose
them is because you

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:52.860 align:middle line:84%
are going to do some
of them in your Pset.

00:37:52.860 --> 00:38:03.860 align:middle line:90%


00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's another
diagram like that, et cetera.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:12.950 align:middle line:90%
Let me just do two more.

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:14.630 align:middle line:84%
There's still some
more diagrams you can

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:20.560 align:middle line:90%
draw to lambda squared order.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:26.520 align:middle line:90%


00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.190 align:middle line:90%
But again, it's mechanical.

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:35.190 align:middle line:84%
With a little bit patience,
there's no mystery here.

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:36.735 align:middle line:84%
Now let me make
some remarks here.

00:38:36.735 --> 00:38:49.000 align:middle line:90%


00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.650 align:middle line:90%
Let me make some remarks here.

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:56.650 align:middle line:90%


00:38:56.650 --> 00:39:03.800 align:middle line:84%
First, so the diagram, you can
see separate into two types.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.240 align:middle line:84%
So the full Gn separated
into two types.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.495 align:middle line:84%
One type is called
connected diagrams.

00:39:08.495 --> 00:39:15.340 align:middle line:90%


00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Connected diagrams, just
essentially by its name,

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:25.080 align:middle line:84%
this corresponds
to diagrams which

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.590 align:middle line:84%
all the external legs
they are connected

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:32.010 align:middle line:90%
within a single diagram.

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:37.800 align:middle line:84%
This is a connected diagram or
this is a connected diagram,

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:42.780 align:middle line:84%
but this is not, this
is connected diagram,

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:47.250 align:middle line:84%
this is connected diagram, this
connected diagram, this is not.

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:49.185 align:middle line:90%
This is also connected diagram.

00:39:49.185 --> 00:39:53.420 align:middle line:90%


00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.225 align:middle line:84%
And you can also have
disconnected diagrams.

00:39:56.225 --> 00:40:02.820 align:middle line:90%


00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Disconnected diagrams
corresponding

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:11.470 align:middle line:84%
to diagrams that's here,
so your external legs

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:13.960 align:middle line:90%
separated into sub-diagrams.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:19.210 align:middle line:84%
They belong to product
of sub-diagrams.

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And later you will see,
later we will argue,

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.603 align:middle line:84%
this is actually
not interesting.

00:40:26.603 --> 00:40:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Only connected diagrams
are interesting,

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:31.450 align:middle line:90%
but in a few minutes.

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:34.870 align:middle line:84%
For the moment, let's
just still define them.

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:50.520 align:middle line:90%


00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:58.935 align:middle line:84%
And emphasize again,
the external pi general.

00:40:58.935 --> 00:41:01.830 align:middle line:90%


00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Each external line, which
you can assign a momentum

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.140 align:middle line:90%
pi from the Fourier transform.

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.780 align:middle line:90%


00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:23.320 align:middle line:84%
For example here, you have p1,
p2, p3, p4 in momentum space.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Each one you can assign a
momentum and note momentum

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:26.990 align:middle line:90%
general.

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:28.782 align:middle line:84%
It can be in principle,
it can be anything.

00:41:28.782 --> 00:41:34.260 align:middle line:90%


00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.330 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:38.703 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:38.703 --> 00:41:40.120 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is there
a trick to know

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:44.750 align:middle line:84%
that you've got all of them,
like do you count them?

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:46.640 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: No, there's
no trick to make

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.630 align:middle line:90%
sure you counted all of them.

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:49.865 align:middle line:90%
The only trick is patience.

00:41:49.865 --> 00:41:55.680 align:middle line:90%


00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:59.220 align:middle line:84%
Just try to eliminate
all possibilities.

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:01.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a finite number of
them, you can always do it.

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:01.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:04.500 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Can you
use metrics, like

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.360 align:middle line:90%
count the number of diagrams.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.230 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:09.180 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Can you count
the number of diagrams

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:12.330 align:middle line:84%
with a certain number of
objects and external points?

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:15.060 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: No, I think
there's no general formula

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:17.910 align:middle line:84%
to tell you at each order how
many diagrams you should have.

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:19.635 align:middle line:84%
There's no such kind
of magic formula.

00:42:19.635 --> 00:42:23.890 align:middle line:90%


00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:28.510 align:middle line:90%
There's only one formula.

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:29.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not the formula.

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:33.130 align:middle line:84%
There's only one trend
which you can show,

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:42.040 align:middle line:84%
that when you go to mth order,
there are how many roughly

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:45.870 align:middle line:90%
how many diagrams at mth order?

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:46.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:47.660 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: m factorial.

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:49.350 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: That's
right, m factorial,

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:51.500 align:middle line:90%
so it's quite a lot of them.

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Once you go to say fourth or
fifth order, it becomes a lot.

00:42:55.430 --> 00:43:02.270 align:middle line:90%


00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:06.740 align:middle line:84%
You can be sure that we will
not ask you to eliminate

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.750 align:middle line:90%
to fourth order in your Pset.

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:16.580 align:middle line:90%


00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:21.170 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the growth of the
number of Feynman diagrams

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:22.655 align:middle line:90%
implies something deep.

00:43:22.655 --> 00:43:26.370 align:middle line:90%


00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:28.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a side remark.

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:33.160 align:middle line:84%
It implies that this
perturbation theory in lambda,

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:37.000 align:middle line:84%
it's actually not convergent
because the number of diagrams

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.300 align:middle line:90%
grow too fast.

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And so if at mth order
becomes m factorial,

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:46.780 align:middle line:84%
then that means the mth
order contribution also

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.210 align:middle line:84%
grows as m factorial,
and then that

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:51.700 align:middle line:84%
means this power series is
actually not convergent.

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.160 align:middle line:90%
It's only asymptotic series.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.935 align:middle line:84%
But still, for many physical
purposes, it's enough.

00:43:56.935 --> 00:44:00.830 align:middle line:90%


00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:01.330 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:03.310 align:middle line:90%
Any other questions?

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Because this concludes
our discussion

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:14.230 align:middle line:84%
of calculating such kind of
Feynman correlation functions

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:17.620 align:middle line:90%
for interacting theory.

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:18.308 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:18.308 --> 00:44:20.350 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: You just said
that it's not convergent,

00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:22.270 align:middle line:90%
but it is asymptotic.

00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:26.230 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, it's
an asymptotic series.

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:29.415 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Sorry, what's the
distinction between those?

00:44:29.415 --> 00:44:30.790 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah,
asymptotic series

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:32.470 align:middle line:84%
is the kind of
series which you--

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:37.060 align:middle line:90%


00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Just the higher order
terms will be small

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.550 align:middle line:84%
or will be smaller and
smaller for a while

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:45.680 align:middle line:90%
and then grow again.

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:49.587 align:middle line:84%
And so if you don't calculate
to high of an order,

00:44:49.587 --> 00:44:50.920 align:middle line:90%
they're actually quite reliable.

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:53.625 align:middle line:90%
You can bound the errors.

00:44:53.625 --> 00:44:56.170 align:middle line:90%


00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:58.390 align:middle line:84%
This is the heuristic
way to say it.

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:01.320 align:middle line:90%


00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:06.700 align:middle line:84%
It's just when you look at
the first few order terms,

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.970 align:middle line:84%
it's a reliable approximation
to your true answer.

00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:12.420 align:middle line:90%


00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:15.120 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I guess we started
out by setting the interaction

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:19.980 align:middle line:84%
term to be phi to the
4th, but the action side.

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:24.725 align:middle line:84%
But in general, you're going
to have some series of terms

00:45:24.725 --> 00:45:25.600 align:middle line:90%
added to your action.

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:29.333 align:middle line:84%
Is that how you would do
a general interaction?

00:45:29.333 --> 00:45:31.250 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: No, depends
on your specific theory.

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:34.410 align:middle line:90%


00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:38.820 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's just your theory.

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.430 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: How do you apply
this to a physical problem?

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:42.408 align:middle line:90%
How do you know what--

00:45:42.408 --> 00:45:43.950 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, in
physical problem--

00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:49.110 align:middle line:90%


00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:51.510 align:middle line:84%
In one second we
will tell you how

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:54.780 align:middle line:84%
you come from here to calculate
the scattering amplitude.

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you find the
scattering amplitude,

00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:00.600 align:middle line:84%
then you can measure
the experiment,

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:04.120 align:middle line:84%
then you try to deduce
back the action.

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.620 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: And in general what
changes is just how many edges

00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:07.742 align:middle line:90%
your vertex has?

00:46:07.742 --> 00:46:09.358 align:middle line:90%
Is that the phi to the n?

00:46:09.358 --> 00:46:11.150 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, that's
right, that's right.

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:12.692 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: What if
it's, I don't know,

00:46:12.692 --> 00:46:15.480 align:middle line:84%
1 over like something
[INAUDIBLE],, is that--

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:16.920 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: It can happen.

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:22.230 align:middle line:84%
As a toy model, you can always
write whatever theory you want,

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:26.220 align:middle line:84%
but in nature somehow the
series we discovered so

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:27.420 align:middle line:90%
is all polynomial.

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:33.220 align:middle line:90%


00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:34.150 align:middle line:90%
OK, good?

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:36.670 align:middle line:90%


00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Earlier we mentioned that there
is this LSZ theorem, which

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:48.700 align:middle line:84%
tells you that the
scattering amplitude can

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:50.950 align:middle line:84%
be obtained from this
time-ordered correlation

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:52.840 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go back
to this LSZ story

00:46:56.230 --> 00:47:00.490 align:middle line:84%
again to tell you actually how
to obtain scattering amplitude

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:03.880 align:middle line:90%
from correlation functions.

00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:12.830 align:middle line:90%


00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:17.030 align:middle line:90%
The basic idea is the following.

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:18.890 align:middle line:84%
The basic idea is
following-- is that you

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:26.390 align:middle line:84%
take your n-point function with
n external momentum p1 to pn.

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:30.340 align:middle line:90%


00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:35.450 align:middle line:84%
So as I emphasized here,
each pi is general.

00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:44.390 align:middle line:84%
But now suppose you take
all momentum, all pi,

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:45.350 align:middle line:90%
to be on shell.

00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:50.910 align:middle line:90%


00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Now you consider them
to satisfy pi squared

00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:57.195 align:middle line:90%
equal to minus m squared.

00:47:57.195 --> 00:48:05.447 align:middle line:90%


00:48:05.447 --> 00:48:07.780 align:middle line:84%
In order to get the amplitude,
you need to do this step.

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:09.500 align:middle line:84%
You take all the
external momentum.

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:11.800 align:middle line:84%
This is very
reasonable to expect

00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:15.350 align:middle line:84%
because when we're
scattering particles,

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:17.680 align:middle line:84%
remember we say the initial
particle can be considered

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:19.510 align:middle line:84%
as a free particle,
final particle

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:21.670 align:middle line:84%
can also be considered
as a free particle.

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:25.060 align:middle line:84%
If they are free particles,
then their momentum

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:28.210 align:middle line:84%
satisfies this
on-shell condition.

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:31.180 align:middle line:84%
In order to relate this
to scattering amplitude,

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:33.910 align:middle line:84%
then we need to take external
momentum to be on-shell.

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:37.177 align:middle line:90%


00:48:37.177 --> 00:48:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Now if you look at
this, you say there

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:43.230 align:middle line:84%
are two possible choices
for this equation

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:45.750 align:middle line:84%
because this equation
has two solutions.

00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:54.480 align:middle line:90%


00:48:54.480 --> 00:49:06.240 align:middle line:84%
So for each pi, pi0 can
either be plus minus omega pi.

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:09.390 align:middle line:84%
We are using the same
notation we used before,

00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:12.840 align:middle line:84%
so this Pi vector
is the spatial part,

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.780 align:middle line:90%
and then we have omega Pi.

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:18.120 align:middle line:90%
This omega pi is just the--ok?

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:28.220 align:middle line:90%


00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:30.800 align:middle line:84%
So you have two
possible solutions.

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:36.690 align:middle line:90%


00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:38.400 align:middle line:90%
Now the rule is the following--

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:45.620 align:middle line:90%


00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:51.350 align:middle line:90%
let's take p1, take m of them.

00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:56.570 align:middle line:90%


00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:58.805 align:middle line:90%
We take the negative root.

00:49:58.805 --> 00:50:04.850 align:middle line:90%


00:50:04.850 --> 00:50:10.290 align:middle line:90%
So alpha would be 1 over 2m.

00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:15.530 align:middle line:84%
Then for the rest,
say Pm plus 1,

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:18.530 align:middle line:84%
let's consider the
following situation.

00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:21.035 align:middle line:84%
And then you take
the positive root.

00:50:21.035 --> 00:50:34.540 align:middle line:90%


00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:35.040 align:middle line:90%
Ok?

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's consider the
following situation.

00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:44.810 align:middle line:90%


00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's imagine we take such an
n-point function in momentum

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:57.700 align:middle line:84%
space, and then we take
all the momentum on-shell,

00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:04.120 align:middle line:84%
but for some of them we take the
negative root and some of them

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:08.890 align:middle line:84%
we take the positive root,
and then there's a theorem.

00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:12.745 align:middle line:84%
So this is called LSZ
theorem, which is 3 person--

00:51:12.745 --> 00:51:16.150 align:middle line:90%


00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Lehmann, Symanzik,
and Zimmerman.

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:22.835 align:middle line:84%
This theorem is says,
under this limit.

00:51:22.835 --> 00:51:29.190 align:middle line:90%


00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:31.740 align:middle line:90%
Under this limit.

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:32.970 align:middle line:90%
Under this on-shell limit.

00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:38.800 align:middle line:90%


00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:45.090 align:middle line:84%
So you will see why we emphasize
that we call it on-shell limit.

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:47.730 align:middle line:84%
So imagine you
don't actually put

00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:52.220 align:middle line:90%
them to be exactly a momentum.

00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:56.280 align:middle line:84%
You take the momentum
to approach that.

00:51:56.280 --> 00:52:00.040 align:middle line:84%
We approach that,
we just emphasize.

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:05.955 align:middle line:84%
So in this limit then you find
your momentum space correlation

00:52:05.955 --> 00:52:06.455 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:52:06.455 --> 00:52:18.550 align:middle line:90%


00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Can you find your momentum space
correlation function approach

00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:26.765 align:middle line:84%
to the following
quantity in this limit.

00:52:26.765 --> 00:52:45.880 align:middle line:90%


00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:49.540 align:middle line:84%
First, we write
down the expression

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:51.505 align:middle line:84%
and then we will
explain what this means.

00:52:51.505 --> 00:53:02.960 align:middle line:90%


00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And then we just
do the downstairs.

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:10.900 align:middle line:90%


00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:12.010 align:middle line:90%
Do the downstairs.

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:20.960 align:middle line:90%


00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:22.040 align:middle line:90%
Plus infinity.

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:32.030 align:middle line:90%


00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So the statement
is the following,

00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:36.665 align:middle line:84%
and here Z is just
some constant.

00:53:36.665 --> 00:53:40.470 align:middle line:90%


00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:42.870 align:middle line:90%
We don't need to worry about it.

00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:46.010 align:middle line:90%
Z is just some constant.

00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:48.650 align:middle line:84%
This is square root Z
divided by this factor

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:54.980 align:middle line:84%
for each external
momentum, and this

00:53:54.980 --> 00:54:00.080 align:middle line:84%
is the scattering amplitude
for m initial particles.

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Oh, sorry, I forgot
the minus sign.

00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:07.270 align:middle line:84%
It should be minus p1,
minus p2, to minus pm.

00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:11.380 align:middle line:84%
This is the scattering
amplitude for particles

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:17.770 align:middle line:84%
with initial momentum minus
p1 to minus pm into particles

00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:23.590 align:middle line:84%
with final momentum
m plus 1 to pn.

00:54:23.590 --> 00:54:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, whether you
choose the negative root

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:31.660 align:middle line:84%
or the positive root
decides whether you

00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:35.763 align:middle line:84%
are in the initial state
or in the final state.

00:54:35.763 --> 00:54:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Whether you are in the final
state in the scattering

00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:38.620 align:middle line:90%
amplitude.

00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:49.620 align:middle line:90%


00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:50.625 align:middle line:90%
Let me just write here.

00:54:50.625 --> 00:54:55.340 align:middle line:90%


00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:58.880 align:middle line:90%
Let me just copy this again.

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:02.480 align:middle line:90%
This scattering amplitude--

00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let me just write
here this pm, pm plus 1,

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:23.230 align:middle line:84%
pm plus infinity minus p1
minus pm minus infinity.

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:27.410 align:middle line:84%
This is the
scattering amplitude.

00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:31.240 align:middle line:84%
This is the
scattering amplitude.

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:40.360 align:middle line:84%
This is an amplitude
for the particle

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:47.980 align:middle line:84%
with momentum p1 pm
at t equal to minus

00:55:47.980 --> 00:56:02.710 align:middle line:84%
infinity transitioning to the
rest particles at this momentum

00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:04.000 align:middle line:90%
at t plus infinity.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:24.980 align:middle line:90%


00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:32.300 align:middle line:84%
To save the location,
again, remember previously

00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:32.930 align:middle line:90%
we defined--

00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:49.870 align:middle line:90%


00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:54.730 align:middle line:84%
If you remember before,
we defined this object.

00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:56.530 align:middle line:84%
This object should
also preserve,

00:56:56.530 --> 00:57:00.400 align:middle line:84%
because of time
translation symmetry,

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:04.090 align:middle line:84%
this object will also preserve
the energy and momentum.

00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:07.660 align:middle line:84%
This object is
also proportional,

00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:18.860 align:middle line:84%
so you can extract out the
delta function and then times

00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:21.680 align:middle line:84%
a quantity, which we called
the scattering amplitude for,

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:23.660 align:middle line:90%
say alpha to beta.

00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Alpha denotes the initial state,
so this is the initial state

00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:30.950 align:middle line:84%
alpha, and this is
the final state beta.

00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:36.940 align:middle line:90%


00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:43.438 align:middle line:84%
Now if you plug this
expression into here,

00:57:43.438 --> 00:57:45.730 align:middle line:84%
then the delta function will
just cancel on both sides.

00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:49.650 align:middle line:90%


00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And then you find
Gn p1 pn is just

00:57:55.170 --> 00:58:00.750 align:middle line:84%
equal to, approach this
product of the delta functions,

00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:middle line:84%
approach this factor,
and then M alpha to beta.

00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:12.780 align:middle line:90%


00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:19.120 align:middle line:84%
This is a statement
of the LSZ theorem.

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:29.710 align:middle line:84%
This essentially tells you that
such a scattering amplitude

00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:35.980 align:middle line:84%
just can be obtained from this,
and you multiply those things,

00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:38.260 align:middle line:90%
and then just equal to that.

00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Now you observe, up
to this factor of Z,

00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:45.910 align:middle line:84%
these are precisely
just propagators

00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:46.975 align:middle line:90%
for the external legs.

00:58:46.975 --> 00:58:49.720 align:middle line:90%


00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Now you conclude,
in other words, that

00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:00.560 align:middle line:84%
means that M alpha beta
then corresponding to you

00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:04.490 align:middle line:84%
just take the G, then
you get rid of all

00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:07.400 align:middle line:84%
the external propagators
because they're

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:10.250 align:middle line:84%
just corresponding to
the external propagators

00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:11.930 align:middle line:90%
for each external leg.

00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Just get rid of
the external legs.

00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Here I'm just telling you the
theorem and we will use it,

00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:22.130 align:middle line:84%
but of course, the derivation
is a little bit complicated.

00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:29.850 align:middle line:90%


00:59:29.850 --> 00:59:31.485 align:middle line:90%
Let me just write it in words.

00:59:31.485 --> 00:59:36.550 align:middle line:90%


00:59:36.550 --> 00:59:46.830 align:middle line:84%
To obtain the scattering
amplitude M to alpha beta,

00:59:46.830 --> 00:59:48.690 align:middle line:90%
you first calculate.

00:59:48.690 --> 00:59:56.990 align:middle line:90%


00:59:56.990 --> 01:00:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Suppose the total number
of initial particles

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.450 align:middle line:84%
and the final particles
are n and then

01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:11.090 align:middle line:84%
you just take Gn
for n particles.

01:00:11.090 --> 01:00:14.060 align:middle line:90%


01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And then take pi on-shell,
and the initial momentum

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:48.870 align:middle line:84%
take the negative root,
and in the final momentum

01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:53.835 align:middle line:84%
you take a positive
root of that equation.

01:00:53.835 --> 01:00:56.590 align:middle line:90%


01:00:56.590 --> 01:01:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And then the last
step you just truncate

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.320 align:middle line:90%
all the external propagators.

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:29.310 align:middle line:90%


01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you truncated
all the external legs.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So that just comes
from you need to obtain

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:42.630 align:middle line:84%
M. You need to divide
this side by this factor

01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:45.480 align:middle line:84%
then up to this factor of
Z. This factor Z will only

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:53.620 align:middle line:84%
give you a constant, which let's
not worry about it for now.

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:54.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:55.825 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:55.825 --> 01:02:01.140 align:middle line:90%


01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:04.040 align:middle line:84%
it seems like you
just put it in ad hoc.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.812 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Which
is putting ad hoc?

01:02:06.812 --> 01:02:08.770 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Why are you
just setting some of them

01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:09.880 align:middle line:90%
to be negative?

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:11.230 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Oh, yeah.

01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:12.400 align:middle line:90%
That I will explain.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.315 align:middle line:90%
That I will explain.

01:02:13.315 --> 01:02:16.300 align:middle line:90%


01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.550 align:middle line:84%
First, let me just
state the rule.

01:02:18.550 --> 01:02:20.650 align:middle line:84%
First, you understand
the rule, then

01:02:20.650 --> 01:02:24.340 align:middle line:84%
I try to make you more
comfortable with the rule.

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:26.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:27.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, here is just the rule.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Here I'm just explaining
here is the rule.

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:38.230 align:middle line:84%
This is a statement you
can prove mathematically,

01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:40.485 align:middle line:84%
so this is a mathematical
statement you can prove.

01:02:40.485 --> 01:02:43.100 align:middle line:90%


01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And then following
from this statement,

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:57.900 align:middle line:84%
here is the rule to obtain
the M alpha beta from the G.

01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:00.120 align:middle line:84%
If I want to write
it in one sentence--

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:03.020 align:middle line:90%


01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:18.430 align:middle line:84%
scattering amplitude
equals to sum over

01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:37.944 align:middle line:84%
all truncated diagrams with
external momentum on-shell.

01:03:37.944 --> 01:03:45.500 align:middle line:90%


01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:48.380 align:middle line:84%
If I summarize it into one
sentence, it's just this.

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:58.530 align:middle line:90%


01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:04.260 align:middle line:84%
I would say the only
thing unintuitive here

01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:05.520 align:middle line:90%
is this sign choice.

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.100 align:middle line:90%


01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Everything else I
think is intuitive.

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Everything else is intuitive.

01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:15.630 align:middle line:84%
You take this Green
function, which contains

01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:18.210 align:middle line:90%
essentially any external legs.

01:04:18.210 --> 01:04:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And now you just imagine this
internal legs corresponding

01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:24.570 align:middle line:84%
to initial and final
particles, and then it's

01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:28.390 align:middle line:84%
very reasonable we make
them on-shell because they

01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:30.710 align:middle line:90%
are physical particles.

01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Then the only thing
which may be unintuitive

01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:34.490 align:middle line:84%
is that why for the
initial momentum

01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:37.100 align:middle line:84%
we need to take the negative
root, but for the final one

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:40.340 align:middle line:90%
we need to take a positive root.

01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Then the final
thing here is just

01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:47.510 align:middle line:84%
if you imagine when
you scatter particles

01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:52.670 align:middle line:84%
and how they propagate to the
scattering does not matter.

01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:54.380 align:middle line:84%
The propagator just
essentially tells you

01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:58.820 align:middle line:84%
this particle how they propagate
to the scattering point.

01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:01.640 align:middle line:90%


01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.890 align:middle line:84%
This should not matter for
the scattering process.

01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:08.990 align:middle line:90%


01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:14.820 align:middle line:84%
We will explain this at the
end, but before we do that,

01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:18.320 align:middle line:90%
let's just look at one example.

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Do you have any questions?

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:20.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:22.738 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I just to make
sure I understand when

01:05:22.738 --> 01:05:25.480 align:middle line:84%
we say truncate we mean
divide n and divide Gn

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:26.620 align:middle line:90%
and by this product.

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:31.600 align:middle line:90%


01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.700 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, you will
see explicitly we just

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:39.210 align:middle line:84%
don't include all the
external propagators.

01:05:39.210 --> 01:05:40.335 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you an example.

01:05:40.335 --> 01:05:42.597 align:middle line:90%
It will be clear.

01:05:42.597 --> 01:05:43.930 align:middle line:90%
Let me just give you an example.

01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:48.825 align:middle line:84%
Let's consider four
particles scattering.

01:05:48.825 --> 01:05:49.450 align:middle line:90%
Let's consider.

01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:58.370 align:middle line:90%


01:05:58.370 --> 01:06:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Following the convention
here is the minus p1 p2,

01:06:02.330 --> 01:06:11.830 align:middle line:84%
so you have minus
p1 and minus p2,

01:06:11.830 --> 01:06:16.330 align:middle line:90%
and then you have p3 and p4.

01:06:16.330 --> 01:06:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's suppose we
want to calculate

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:22.150 align:middle line:84%
such kind of scattering
amplitude to initial particles

01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:25.630 align:middle line:84%
with momentum minus
p1 and minus p2.

01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:28.090 align:middle line:84%
When you take this to
be the negative root,

01:06:28.090 --> 01:06:31.960 align:middle line:84%
then the minus p1 will
actually have positive energy.

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:34.490 align:middle line:84%
The minus p1 will actually
have a positive energy,

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:38.190 align:middle line:84%
so all of them have
positive energy.

01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:39.880 align:middle line:84%
All of them have
positive energy.

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:42.560 align:middle line:90%


01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:45.530 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
calculate in this case,

01:06:45.530 --> 01:06:55.030 align:middle line:84%
then you just take
the G4 p1 p4, and then

01:06:55.030 --> 01:07:01.180 align:middle line:84%
you just take p1 and p2 to
take to be negative root.

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:05.320 align:middle line:90%


01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Just to save the time to
take to the negative root.

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And then p3 p4 to be
the positive root.

01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:21.760 align:middle line:90%


01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And then you put
the t here, then

01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:30.610 align:middle line:84%
you truncate your
external propagator.

01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Then you truncate your
external propagator.

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:37.520 align:middle line:84%
What this means, let's look at
the leading order contribution

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.020 align:middle line:90%
to this.

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:41.925 align:middle line:90%


01:07:41.925 --> 01:07:43.550 align:middle line:84%
The leading order
contribution to that,

01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:44.967 align:middle line:84%
we already have
the diagram there.

01:07:44.967 --> 01:07:52.450 align:middle line:90%


01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:56.960 align:middle line:84%
The leading order,
in the free theory,

01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:59.870 align:middle line:84%
those processes don't
contribute because those things,

01:07:59.870 --> 01:08:01.370 align:middle line:90%
there's no interaction here.

01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:03.600 align:middle line:90%
Particle just propagates.

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:07.070 align:middle line:84%
So the lowest
diagram is this one.

01:08:07.070 --> 01:08:09.560 align:middle line:84%
The lowest diagram is
this one, so we just

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:12.350 align:middle line:84%
consider that diagram, so
that's just leading order

01:08:12.350 --> 01:08:13.415 align:middle line:90%
given by that diagram.

01:08:13.415 --> 01:08:18.990 align:middle line:90%


01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:28.939 align:middle line:84%
Then you have minus p1
minus p2 and then p3 and p4.

01:08:28.939 --> 01:08:32.609 align:middle line:90%


01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:38.279 align:middle line:84%
Now according to our Feynman
rule, this vertex just

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:42.390 align:middle line:84%
gives you a factor
of minus i lambda.

01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to calculate
this Green function,

01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:50.490 align:middle line:84%
then we need to include
all these four propagators.

01:08:50.490 --> 01:08:53.640 align:middle line:84%
But here it tells
us to truncate,

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:56.810 align:middle line:84%
but all the propagators
here are external,

01:08:56.810 --> 01:08:58.439 align:middle line:90%
so we don't include them.

01:08:58.439 --> 01:09:00.770 align:middle line:84%
So the answer here is
simple-- just minus i lambda.

01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:03.460 align:middle line:90%


01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:06.040 align:middle line:84%
The leading order contribution
to these 4 particles

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.540 align:middle line:84%
scattering is just
minus i lambda.

01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:10.979 align:middle line:90%


01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And then you have all the
lambda squared contributions.

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:17.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:09:17.830 --> 01:09:19.622 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Why didn't
we consider the other,

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:22.000 align:middle line:84%
the one where one
is just propagating

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.314 align:middle line:90%
and the other has a loop?

01:09:23.314 --> 01:09:28.460 align:middle line:90%


01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:31.550 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: I'm going
to mention that good.

01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:32.810 align:middle line:90%
That's a good question.

01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:35.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to mention that.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.532 align:middle line:84%
Again, that one does not
correspond to the scattering.

01:09:37.532 --> 01:09:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Essentially it's
just corresponding

01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:42.200 align:middle line:84%
to one particle
propagated because there's

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:45.680 align:middle line:84%
no interaction
between the particles.

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.819 align:middle line:90%
They factorize.

01:09:46.819 --> 01:09:50.510 align:middle line:90%


01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:53.903 align:middle line:84%
This one involves the two
particles then, there's

01:09:53.903 --> 01:09:55.820 align:middle line:84%
an interaction, you go
to two other particles.

01:09:55.820 --> 01:10:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Here just one particle straight
goes to the other particle,

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.870 align:middle line:84%
so this particle by definition
has to be the same as this one,

01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:07.220 align:middle line:84%
this has to be the same,
so there's no scattering.

01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:12.700 align:middle line:84%
I will mention this point
separately a little bit later.

01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Another possibility
if we want to consider

01:10:17.850 --> 01:10:28.580 align:middle line:84%
the decay of a particle
into three other particles.

01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:32.510 align:middle line:90%


01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:36.320 align:middle line:84%
The decay of a particle
into three other particles.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:41.090 align:middle line:84%
In this case then,
again, we take G4,

01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:46.670 align:middle line:84%
so now we take minus
p1, and then p2, p3, p4,

01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:49.670 align:middle line:90%
and now we take p1, p4.

01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:56.400 align:middle line:84%
Now we take p1 goes to minus
root, p1 0 is the minus omega,

01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:03.620 align:middle line:84%
and then p3, 2, 3, 4 take
it to be the positive root.

01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And then that's corresponding
to this process.

01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And again, the leading term, the
nontrivial term is just this.

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:16.650 align:middle line:84%
The leading nontrivial term is
this, so now this is minus p1,

01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:22.320 align:middle line:90%
so now this is p2, p3, p4.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:25.988 align:middle line:84%
Again, the leading order,
this is just minus i lambda

01:11:25.988 --> 01:11:28.155 align:middle line:84%
because you don't need to
include the external legs.

01:11:28.155 --> 01:11:31.890 align:middle line:90%


01:11:31.890 --> 01:11:34.110 align:middle line:84%
This goes on to a
single particle decay

01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:35.550 align:middle line:90%
into three other particles.

01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:51.150 align:middle line:90%


01:11:51.150 --> 01:11:52.830 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: In the phi
4 theory, there's

01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:58.050 align:middle line:84%
no conservation law or anything
for preventing this, right?

01:11:58.050 --> 01:11:58.830 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: No, no.

01:11:58.830 --> 01:12:02.280 align:middle line:90%


01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.900 align:middle line:90%
So now let me make some remarks.

01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:33.290 align:middle line:90%


01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:33.800 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:36.050 align:middle line:84%
I erased this, but
yeah, I'm fine.

01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:48.610 align:middle line:90%


01:12:48.610 --> 01:12:49.510 align:middle line:90%
So the remarks.

01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:59.460 align:middle line:90%


01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:01.860 align:middle line:84%
You already asked,
when we calculate

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:03.930 align:middle line:84%
this to the leading
order, we only

01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:05.595 align:middle line:90%
included the connected diagrams.

01:13:05.595 --> 01:13:09.230 align:middle line:90%


01:13:09.230 --> 01:13:20.620 align:middle line:84%
The disconnected diagrams
in general factorize.

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:25.030 align:middle line:84%
It means that when you
have disconnected diagram,

01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:33.920 align:middle line:84%
it means that your process
factorizes into subscattering

01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:43.385 align:middle line:90%
process of lower orders.

01:13:43.385 --> 01:13:53.990 align:middle line:90%


01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:58.220 align:middle line:84%
As we were doing here, there's
one other diagram which

01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:01.310 align:middle line:90%
corresponds to just this one.

01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:04.520 align:middle line:90%


01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Just corresponding
to this, you have

01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:14.750 align:middle line:90%
p1 minus p1, minus p2, p3, p4.

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:17.900 align:middle line:84%
You can also have a
diagram like this.

01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:19.400 align:middle line:84%
But in this case,
just corresponding

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:23.690 align:middle line:84%
to p1 separately go to p3
and p2 separately goes to p4,

01:14:23.690 --> 01:14:26.690 align:middle line:90%
so nothing really happens.

01:14:26.690 --> 01:14:32.440 align:middle line:84%
So in general, you have
m particle scattering.

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:35.260 align:middle line:90%
You have m particle scattering.

01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:39.310 align:middle line:84%
So with some number
of initial particles

01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:43.960 align:middle line:84%
and some number of
final particles.

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:47.920 align:middle line:84%
When you have a
disconnected diagram,

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:51.170 align:middle line:84%
it means that you have
a situation like this.

01:14:51.170 --> 01:14:55.120 align:middle line:84%
You have one diagram with
some subset of particles

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:58.780 align:middle line:84%
go to some subset of particles,
and with a lot of diagrams

01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:01.225 align:middle line:84%
some set of particles,
some set of particles.

01:15:01.225 --> 01:15:03.940 align:middle line:90%


01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:05.890 align:middle line:84%
This is a three to
three scattering,

01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:08.560 align:middle line:84%
and then essentially this
factorizes into two to two

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.360 align:middle line:84%
scattering, and then
one particle just

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:12.670 align:middle line:90%
goes to another particle.

01:15:12.670 --> 01:15:14.620 align:middle line:84%
This can already be
understood in terms

01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:15.670 align:middle line:90%
of lower order process.

01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:20.590 align:middle line:90%


01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:21.685 align:middle line:90%
We don't include them.

01:15:21.685 --> 01:15:24.162 align:middle line:90%


01:15:24.162 --> 01:15:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, they are
already understood.

01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:28.970 align:middle line:90%


01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:31.280 align:middle line:84%
When we define the
scattering amplitude,

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.330 align:middle line:90%
we don't include them.

01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:37.060 align:middle line:90%


01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:56.280 align:middle line:84%
We are only interested
in process involving

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.960 align:middle line:90%
all participating particles.

01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:09.800 align:middle line:90%


01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:11.525 align:middle line:84%
We are actually
running out of time.

01:16:11.525 --> 01:16:19.150 align:middle line:90%


01:16:19.150 --> 01:16:20.170 align:middle line:90%
This is first remark.

01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:23.630 align:middle line:90%


01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:24.380 align:middle line:90%
Second remark.

01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:29.120 align:middle line:90%


01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Since we truncate all
the external legs,

01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:36.690 align:middle line:84%
we truncate all the
external propagators.

01:16:36.690 --> 01:16:43.750 align:middle line:84%
This kind of diagram,
you have a loop on one

01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:47.350 align:middle line:84%
of the external
propagators, so this diagram

01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:48.260 align:middle line:90%
doesn't contribute.

01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:54.340 align:middle line:90%


01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Because this one, after you have
truncated the external legs,

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:02.320 align:middle line:84%
it's no different
from this one, it's

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:05.620 align:middle line:84%
no different from that
one, so you don't have

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:08.380 align:middle line:90%
to count this one separately.

01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:09.820 align:middle line:84%
So this one is
just corresponding

01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:15.160 align:middle line:84%
to when the particle propagates
to infinity somehow there's

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:18.910 align:middle line:84%
some other process to happen
to this particular particle.

01:17:18.910 --> 01:17:22.360 align:middle line:84%
When you truncate the external
legs, they don't include them.

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:28.920 align:middle line:90%


01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:32.580 align:middle line:84%
So that means,
with these two, it

01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:34.650 align:middle line:84%
means that the
scattering amplitude--

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:42.570 align:middle line:90%


01:17:42.570 --> 01:17:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Essentially can forget anything
happening to the external legs.

01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:54.590 align:middle line:90%


01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:57.230 align:middle line:84%
You can have complicated
things happen external legs,

01:17:57.230 --> 01:17:58.210 align:middle line:90%
but they don't matter.

01:17:58.210 --> 01:18:02.700 align:middle line:90%


01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:09.000 align:middle line:84%
To summarize, the
scattering amplitude,

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.740 align:middle line:84%
when you compute the scattering
amplitude, you just sum over--

01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:17.030 align:middle line:90%


01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:20.990 align:middle line:84%
following this definition--
you sum over all truncated.

01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:24.395 align:middle line:84%
It means that you truncate
all the external legs.

01:18:24.395 --> 01:18:27.580 align:middle line:90%


01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:34.555 align:middle line:84%
Connected because we want
all particles to participate.

01:18:34.555 --> 01:18:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And then the external
particle on-shell.

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:44.240 align:middle line:90%


01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.820 align:middle line:84%
This is a
simplification compared

01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:49.687 align:middle line:84%
to calculating the general
correlation functions.

01:18:49.687 --> 01:18:52.220 align:middle line:90%


01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:54.980 align:middle line:84%
I have two other remarks to
make, but we don't have time.

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:58.970 align:middle line:84%
One remark contains the
choice of this sign--

01:18:58.970 --> 01:19:01.880 align:middle line:84%
why initial momentum
corresponding to negative root

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:04.790 align:middle line:84%
and why this corresponding
to positive root,

01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of remarks
related to this factor of Z.

01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:17.150 align:middle line:84%
We will talk about them at
the beginning of next lecture.

01:19:17.150 --> 01:19:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And then after that,
then we are done

01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:23.700 align:middle line:84%
with the general formulation
of interacting theory.

01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And now we will be
equipped with the power.

01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, you can calculate
any interacting theory,

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:36.080 align:middle line:84%
any amplitude, using
perturbation theory.

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:39.380 align:middle line:84%
But in order to calculate
anything useful,

01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:42.560 align:middle line:84%
we still have to first
learn how to treat fermions,

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:46.950 align:middle line:84%
how to treat photons, and then
that's what we will do next.

01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:51.030 align:middle line:84%
So we will, starting
next lecture,

01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:54.810 align:middle line:84%
talk about how to
deal with fermions,

01:19:54.810 --> 01:19:57.780 align:middle line:84%
how to introduce fermions, and
after that we'll talk about how

01:19:57.780 --> 01:20:00.930 align:middle line:84%
to introduce photons, and
then we can talk about QED,

01:20:00.930 --> 01:20:04.700 align:middle line:84%
how photons interact with
electrons, et cetera.

01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:06.850 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

01:20:06.850 --> 01:20:10.000 align:middle line:90%
