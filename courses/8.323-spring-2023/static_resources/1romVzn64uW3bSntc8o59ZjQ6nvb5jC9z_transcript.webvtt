00:00:07.664 --> 00:00:10.690 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.530 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: So last time, we
talked about Dirac equation.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:23.225 align:middle line:84%
So the Dirac equation
has the following form:

00:00:23.225 --> 00:00:29.490 align:middle line:84%
gamma mu partial mu
minus m psi equal to 0.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.570 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.100 align:middle line:90%
So here, we have two spaces.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.190 align:middle line:84%
So one is your standard physical
spacetime, so with x mu.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And then we have a
lot of internal space

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.300 align:middle line:84%
which is labeled by the index
of the psi and the gamma,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.970 align:middle line:90%
which has suppressed here.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.385 align:middle line:84%
So psi should be considered
as a four vector.

00:00:55.385 --> 00:00:58.220 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So alpha equal to 1,
2, 3, 4, and the gamma

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.900 align:middle line:84%
mu should be considered
as a matrix--

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.200 align:middle line:90%
a 4x4 matrix.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And so this space
labeled by alpha--

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.365 align:middle line:84%
so this is called
the spinor space.

00:01:17.365 --> 00:01:23.320 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.770 align:middle line:90%
This is called spinor space.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.850 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be
careful that now we

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.510 align:middle line:84%
have two spaces
intertwined together.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.240 align:middle line:84%
One is your ordinary
spacetime, and so this

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.130 align:middle line:84%
is a function of the spacetime,
but it's carried on index--

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.330 align:middle line:90%
yeah, carries on indices.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
matrix equation.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.970 align:middle line:84%
So altogether, there
are four equations here

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.710 align:middle line:90%
for each component of psi.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.730 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, so let me pull--

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.120 align:middle line:84%
let me just write
this a little better.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.805 align:middle line:90%
So this is x--

00:02:00.805 --> 00:02:03.730 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.680 align:middle line:84%
let me call this equation
1, which I will use later.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.185 align:middle line:84%
And this gamma mu, they
are not ordinary matrices.

00:02:10.185 --> 00:02:13.150 align:middle line:90%
They satisfy this condition.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:20.125 align:middle line:84%
Gamma mu, the anticommutator
with nu equal to 2 eta mu nu.

00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:22.630 align:middle line:90%


00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.090 align:middle line:84%
So that means different gamma
matrices when they are indexed

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.600 align:middle line:90%
are not the same.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.380 align:middle line:84%
They anticommute
with each other.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.100 align:middle line:84%
So if you pass them through,
you get a minus sign.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.870 align:middle line:84%
So they anticommute
with each other

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.930 align:middle line:84%
because when mu not equal to
nu, the right-hand side is 0.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And when you pass through
each other, you get the minus.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.240 align:middle line:90%
And the square of them--

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.740 align:middle line:84%
so gamma 0 square, you get
minus 1 because this is 0, 0.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.550 align:middle line:90%
It's minus 1.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And the gamma i squared,
you just get one.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.780 align:middle line:90%
So this is very simple.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.482 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: When you say
gamma i squared is 1,

00:02:59.482 --> 00:03:01.298 align:middle line:84%
you mean like its
the identity matrix?

00:03:01.298 --> 00:03:02.840 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
its identity matrix.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, when I say gamma
0 square is minus 1,

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:84%
it's also minus times
identity matrix.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And also not all
gamma mu are Hermitian

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.650 align:middle line:84%
So the relation is
that the gamma mu

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.605 align:middle line:84%
dagger is equal to gamma
0 gamma mu gamma 0.

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle line:90%


00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.070 align:middle line:90%
So again, from here, you can--

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.910 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so this is just a compact
way to write its properties.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.800 align:middle line:84%
When you have-- when
mu is equal to 0--

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.960 align:middle line:84%
and then you have gamma 0 times
gamma 0 squared is minus 1.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you get the minus gamma
0-- tells you that the gamma

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.160 align:middle line:90%
0 is anti-Hermitian.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you take the
index to be i here,

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.140 align:middle line:90%
and then you have index i here--

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and then when 0 and
i-- they are not

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.580 align:middle line:90%
the same, so they anticommute.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.700 align:middle line:84%
You can pass through this
gamma 0 through this gamma i.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.450 align:middle line:84%
You get the minus sign, and
then gamma 0 square gives you

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.940 align:middle line:84%
another minus
sign, so you get 1.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.150 align:middle line:84%
So that means that the gamma
i dagger equal to gamma i.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.830 align:middle line:90%
So gamma i is hermitian.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:14.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.300 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So is
there supposed to be

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.190 align:middle line:84%
an i in front of
the derivative or do

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.250 align:middle line:90%
we absorb the i into the gamma?

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.800 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: So in my
convention, there is no i.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:33.670 align:middle line:84%
So with this-- so eta mu mu
here is mostly plus metric.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.710 align:middle line:84%
So some people, when they use,
say, mostly negative metric,

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.670 align:middle line:90%
then there may be an i in there.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so it depends
on your convention

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.110 align:middle line:90%
in defining the gamma matrices.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.030 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So for minus
plus plus plus, no i--

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.900 align:middle line:90%
OK, sorry.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.650 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.160 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, as I mentioned last
time, different conventions

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.230 align:middle line:84%
are annoying, so-- but you just
stick one convention-- should

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.010 align:middle line:90%
be fine.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Stick to my convention--
would be fine.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:04.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.605 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Sorry, how can
we get the expression

00:05:06.605 --> 00:05:09.020 align:middle line:90%
for gamma mu dagger?

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.210 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah, this
is just a compact way

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.760 align:middle line:84%
to write down that gamma
0 is anti-Hermitian

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.740 align:middle line:90%
and gamma i is Hermitian.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, just-- this just compact.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just this is useful so
that you can treat all gamma

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.510 align:middle line:84%
mu in the same way
so that you don't

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.860 align:middle line:90%
have to always separate them.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.440 align:middle line:90%


00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.910 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:29.930 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.280 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.400 align:middle line:84%
So last time, we
also said you have

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.260 align:middle line:84%
many, many choices for
gamma mu, but they are all

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.890 align:middle line:90%
physically equivalent.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And so different
choices, they are

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.740 align:middle line:84%
convenient for
different purposes.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.750 align:middle line:84%
So often we just pick one of
them, and depend on the problem

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.520 align:middle line:84%
we are-- yeah, so that comes
with a little bit experience.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.940 align:middle line:84%
So for certain problems,
certain choices

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.590 align:middle line:90%
of gamma become more useful--

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.950 align:middle line:84%
become more easier
to manipulate.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.850 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:06.360 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.190 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's talk about
the Lorentz covariance

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:18.635 align:middle line:84%
of the Dirac equation, which we
started a little bit last time.

00:06:18.635 --> 00:06:24.690 align:middle line:90%


00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.170 align:middle line:84%
So Lorentz covariance means
that the equation looks the same

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.230 align:middle line:90%
in all Lorentz frames.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.270 align:middle line:84%
So when you make a
Lorentz transformation--

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.900 align:middle line:90%
so imagine you make a--

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:38.920 align:middle line:90%
go to another frame.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.650 align:middle line:84%
You start with your frame
defined by this x mu.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.900 align:middle line:84%
So now, imagine you go to
another frame which you

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.730 align:middle line:90%
make a Lorentz transformation.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.390 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.320 align:middle line:84%
So the Lorentz covariance
means your equation

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.370 align:middle line:84%
when written in this frame
in terms of x prime mu

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.870 align:middle line:90%
have the same form.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:84%
So last time, we talked
about the scalar equations

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.310 align:middle line:90%
at the end.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And another equation we have
seen before is the Maxwell

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.330 align:middle line:84%
equation, so let me also
very quickly mention

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.370 align:middle line:90%
for the Maxwell equation.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.880 align:middle line:84%
So when you have a
Maxwell equation,

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.490 align:middle line:84%
which is the story for
the vector potential--

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.190 align:middle line:90%


00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.560 align:middle line:90%
so now, in contrast--

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.375 align:middle line:90%
remember for the scalar case--

00:07:34.375 --> 00:07:37.020 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.410 align:middle line:84%
so last time-- let me
just write it down here.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Last time we said
for the scalar case,

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:84%
when you go to a
different frame,

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.270 align:middle line:84%
the phi prime
should be equal to--

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.690 align:middle line:84%
evaluate the new coordinate
should be equal to phi x.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.360 align:middle line:84%
So this is the transformation
for scalar field.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.230 align:middle line:84%
But now, if you want to
do Maxwell equation--

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:03.450 align:middle line:84%
so we have to think about
how this a mu transform

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:04.920 align:middle line:90%
under Lorentz transformation.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:90%
And now a mu is a vector--

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.800 align:middle line:90%
is a four vector in spacetime.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And so that means that the
a mu should transform also

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.920 align:middle line:90%
as the vector.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:28.630 align:middle line:84%
So this means that when
you go to a new frame,

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:39.786 align:middle line:84%
A mu transforms as
lambda mu nu A nu x.

00:08:39.786 --> 00:08:42.620 align:middle line:90%
So here, not only--

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:47.450 align:middle line:84%
so when A mu evaluate
at new position--

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.870 align:middle line:84%
it can be written as a linear
superposition of the value

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.330 align:middle line:90%
at your original position.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.175 align:middle line:84%
And this linear
superposition by itself

00:08:56.175 --> 00:08:58.550 align:middle line:84%
is a Lorentz transformation
because the A mu is a vector.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:02.670 align:middle line:90%


00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And so that means just under
Lorentz transformation,

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.610 align:middle line:84%
the different components
of A mu should also

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:14.240 align:middle line:90%
change under the transformation.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.950 align:middle line:84%
So given this-- so I
will not show it now.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.980 align:middle line:84%
Just will take a
couple of minutes,

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.200 align:middle line:84%
but you should
convince yourself--

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.880 align:middle line:84%
try to check yourself
that the Maxwell equation,

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.760 align:middle line:84%
which can be written--
so for example, as F mu--

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.890 align:middle line:90%
mu nu equal to 0.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:40.320 align:middle line:84%
This implies that the partial
mu prime in the new frame,

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.610 align:middle line:90%
and then the f mu mu prime.

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:50.010 align:middle line:84%
f mu mu prime is obtained
from this new A mu prime,

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:84%
and these two equations
are the same--

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.490 align:middle line:90%
are equivalent.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Just in one frame, and then when
you go to a different frame,

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.090 align:middle line:90%
then you get this equation.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So the equation has
exactly the same form,

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:middle line:90%
but now it's in the new frame.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.160 align:middle line:90%


00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.140 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's go
to Dirac equation.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:14.730 align:middle line:90%
So now, go to Dirac equation.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:19.960 align:middle line:84%
So in the Dirac equation,
again, this psi--

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.440 align:middle line:84%
we need to ask how the
psi should transform

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.560 align:middle line:90%
under Lorentz transformation.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.570 align:middle line:84%
But now, this psi is a
completely new object.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:34.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is not like
in the Maxwell case.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:36.030 align:middle line:84%
We know this is a
spacetime vector,

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.080 align:middle line:84%
so you can easily guess
how you should transform.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So now this psi-- this spinor
space is completely new.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.530 align:middle line:84%
So now, we have to figure
out how psi transforms.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.500 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.500 --> 00:11:18.270 align:middle line:84%
So let's suppose under a
Lorentz transformation lambda

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:22.130 align:middle line:90%
that psi transforms as follows.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:25.670 align:middle line:90%
Psi prime alpha x prime--

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.550 align:middle line:84%
because now, again, you
evaluate in the new position--

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.200 align:middle line:90%
new frame.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Since this carries
index, in principle,

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.430 align:middle line:90%
this can be a superposition.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:39.320 align:middle line:90%


00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.950 align:middle line:84%
You can mix them in
the internal space.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:46.130 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.860 align:middle line:84%
In principle, we can
have form like this.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Say for some matrix S,
which depends on lambda.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.710 align:middle line:90%


00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So in principle, you can have
a transformation like this.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Say when you evaluate
new position,

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.500 align:middle line:84%
it's given by the value
at the old position,

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:14.710 align:middle line:84%
but now you can make some
rotations in the internal space

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.410 align:middle line:84%
just as here for
the Maxwell field.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:90%


00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:30.750 align:middle line:84%
So except-- and so suppose this
and then the Lorentz covariance

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:37.190 align:middle line:84%
would be the statement,
say, for some matrix.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:40.000 align:middle line:90%


00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And then the Lorentz
covariance then

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:58.350 align:middle line:84%
is a statement starting
from equation 1--

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:02.250 align:middle line:84%
you should be able to find
going to the new frame--

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:07.290 align:middle line:84%
you have an equation like
this-- gamma mu partial mu

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:17.700 align:middle line:84%
prime minus m psi prime
x prime equal to 0.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So you should get an identical
equation-- not identical

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:21.678 align:middle line:90%
equation 2.

00:13:21.678 --> 00:13:23.220 align:middle line:84%
You should get an
identical equation,

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.320 align:middle line:84%
but now everything
is in terms of prime.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.050 align:middle line:90%


00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.600 align:middle line:84%
So I want to emphasize that
gamma mu does not change

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.180 align:middle line:90%
despite a carry index mu.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Mu gamma mu just some
constant matrices--

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:42.160 align:middle line:84%
just the-- it's
just four matrices.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.400 align:middle line:84%
It does not transform
under any spacetime trans--

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.170 align:middle line:90%
it's not dynamic variable.

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.420 align:middle line:84%
It does not transform on the
spacetime transformation,

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.830 align:middle line:90%
so gamma mu does not change.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.500 align:middle line:84%
So now the question of
the Lorentz covariance--

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:84%
where the Dirac equation is
Lorentz covariance boils down

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.810 align:middle line:84%
whether we can find
such S. Whether--

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:15.670 align:middle line:84%
yeah, the question is,
can we find, such an S?

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.290 align:middle line:90%


00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:25.120 align:middle line:84%
So if we can find such
an S, which this is true,

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.290 align:middle line:84%
then we say the Dirac
equation is Lorentz covariant.

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is how the Dirac
field should transform.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.460 align:middle line:84%
So this psi is normally
called the Dirac field,

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.700 align:middle line:84%
and this is how a Dirac
field should transform.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.340 align:middle line:84%
So psi is often
called Dirac field.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.590 align:middle line:84%
It's also often
called spinor field.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's also often
called Dirac spinor field.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, and
then that should be

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:middle line:90%
the way how it's transformed.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:57.030 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Yeah, I was just
confused, because before,

00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:00.439 align:middle line:84%
for the scalar fields, when
we get transformations,

00:15:00.439 --> 00:15:02.387 align:middle line:90%
we would either say--

00:15:02.387 --> 00:15:03.917 align:middle line:84%
like, transform the
fields, like phi

00:15:03.917 --> 00:15:07.257 align:middle line:84%
goes to phi prime or
transform the coordinates,

00:15:07.257 --> 00:15:09.770 align:middle line:90%
like x goes to x prime.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.770 align:middle line:84%
So why did we transform
both in this case?

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:12.580 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.990 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, in this case--

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:18.490 align:middle line:84%
so when you talk about
transform of the scalar field

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:22.870 align:middle line:84%
itself, of course, it's just
phi equal to phi prime and--

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:26.260 align:middle line:90%
because that function changes.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:30.370 align:middle line:84%
But here, we are asking about
the form of the equation

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.150 align:middle line:90%
in the new frame.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And so when you go
to the new frame,

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.100 align:middle line:84%
your function form changes, but
your coordinate also changes.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.800 align:middle line:90%
So that's why you need to--

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.330 align:middle line:84%
when we say the
covariance, you need

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.690 align:middle line:84%
to evaluate your new
function in the new position.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that means they look
the same in different frames.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.570 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So should I think of S
as the representation of lambda

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:53.868 align:middle line:90%
in the spinor space?

00:15:53.868 --> 00:15:54.910 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.200 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.220 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly the right
mathematical language

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:03.790 align:middle line:84%
to talk about this, which
we'll mention later.

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:06.863 align:middle line:84%
At the moment, I didn't want
to use mathematical language.

00:16:06.863 --> 00:16:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, for those people who are
familiar with group theory,

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.060 align:middle line:90%
indeed.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:14.380 align:middle line:84%
So this S would be the
representation of the Lorentz

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.665 align:middle line:90%
group in the spinor space.

00:16:17.665 --> 00:16:20.950 align:middle line:90%


00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:22.730 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:27.220 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's try
to find this S. So

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.000 align:middle line:84%
before we do that,
let's first write

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.910 align:middle line:90%
what is a partial prime x mu.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:39.227 align:middle line:84%
So recall, partial prime
mu, it should be partial,

00:16:39.227 --> 00:16:41.290 align:middle line:90%
partial x prime mu.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.540 align:middle line:84%
This transform the
new coordinate.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And from that
transformation, you

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.630 align:middle line:84%
can easily figure it
out-- just chain rule.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:53.460 align:middle line:84%
So this is the same equal
to partial, partial x

00:16:53.460 --> 00:17:00.060 align:middle line:90%
mu and the lambda minus 1 nu mu.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.330 align:middle line:90%


00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.220 align:middle line:84%
So this is very easy
to figure it out

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:90%
because they have to be--

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.069 align:middle line:90%
x will multiply the x.

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Partial x will have
to be a singlet,

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.060 align:middle line:84%
so this transform
as a inverse matrix.

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:21.660 align:middle line:84%
So this implies
that the gamma mu

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:30.480 align:middle line:84%
partial mu prime should be equal
to lambda minus 1 nu mu gamma

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.100 align:middle line:90%
mu partial nu.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:36.200 align:middle line:90%


00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.440 align:middle line:90%
Let me just write it better.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:46.690 align:middle line:90%


00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.580 align:middle line:84%
so with this
preparation, then we

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:84%
can try to see whether we can
find the S from this equation.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:57.870 align:middle line:84%
No-- yeah, find this
equation from 1.

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So what we can do
is let's multiply

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.970 align:middle line:84%
the equation 1
from the left by S.

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:08.300 align:middle line:90%
So let's imagine we multiply S--

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.260 align:middle line:90%
such a matrix.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Again, I always just
suppress the spinor indices

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and just write in
the matrix form.

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.740 align:middle line:90%
So let's just write gamma mu.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:22.775 align:middle line:84%
So take that equation
1, we multiply it by s.

00:18:22.775 --> 00:18:33.210 align:middle line:90%


00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:35.080 align:middle line:90%
So we have two terms here.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.610 align:middle line:84%
So this is a matrix in
the same space as S.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:41.820 align:middle line:84%
S act in the same
space as gamma mu,

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.700 align:middle line:84%
so we cannot easily
commute here--

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.160 align:middle line:90%
normally, they don't commute.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:53.190 align:middle line:84%
But this-- but m is a constant,
so we can pass S through here.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.170 align:middle line:84%
So we can rewrite this
equation as follows.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:06.705 align:middle line:84%
We can write it as S gamma mu
S minus 1 partial mu minus m S

00:19:06.705 --> 00:19:09.720 align:middle line:90%
psi 0.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:15.930 align:middle line:84%
So for m, I just pass S
through, but for this term,

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:19.800 align:middle line:84%
I just inserted S minus 1 and
S-- and so yeah, it's the same.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.080 align:middle line:90%


00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:29.040 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can use
this equation in here,

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:35.330 align:middle line:84%
because S times psi just
equal to psi prime x prime.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So now, we get S gamma mu S
minus 1 partial mu minus m psi

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.340 align:middle line:90%
prime x prime equal to 0.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:52.770 align:middle line:90%
We just use that equation.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:53.665 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:19:53.665 --> 00:19:55.082 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: I'm a
little confused how

00:19:55.082 --> 00:19:56.583 align:middle line:84%
you can pass S
through partial mu

00:19:56.583 --> 00:20:00.370 align:middle line:84%
because given that
partial mu acts on psi

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.022 align:middle line:84%
and it has to have
a representation

00:20:02.022 --> 00:20:05.570 align:middle line:90%
in this inner space [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.450 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so that's
the key I emphasized earlier.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:12.980 align:middle line:84%
So x mu and psi alpha, they
are in different space.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And so all this S and gamma,
they are all constant.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.920 align:middle line:84%
They don't depend
on spatial location.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And so partial mu does
not act on S. Yeah,

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.870 align:middle line:84%
for partial mu point of
view, S is just a constant.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:27.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a spacetime constant.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:33.010 align:middle line:84%
It's only rotate psi
at a single point--

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:35.530 align:middle line:84%
the different component of
psi at the single point.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:40.990 align:middle line:90%


00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.760 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.320 align:middle line:90%
So now, we have this equation.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:52.420 align:middle line:84%
So now we can compare this
object with this object.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.300 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, in particular, this
object is equal to that.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:13.900 align:middle line:84%
So we conclude that 1 goes
to 2 if S gamma mu S minus 1

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:24.250 align:middle line:84%
equal to this object
lambda minus 1 nu mu.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:27.770 align:middle line:84%
I think-- yeah, I
think I'm messing up

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:30.740 align:middle line:90%
a little bit notation here.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Gamma mu-- I think my index
is a little bit wrong.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.890 align:middle line:90%
Let me just make sure.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:38.960 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, here is a partial nu.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, here is partial
nu, so I need to exchange

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:44.780 align:middle line:90%
the mu and the nu index here.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:51.590 align:middle line:90%
So mu and the nu, then gamma.

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:59.070 align:middle line:90%


00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:03.520 align:middle line:90%
So this has to be equal to that.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So this has to be
equal to that, and you

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:08.920 align:middle line:84%
need to compare partial
nu with partial nu--

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.223 align:middle line:84%
you have to exchange and
nu and the nu here anyway.

00:22:11.223 --> 00:22:13.015 align:middle line:84%
So this is the equation
we have to satisfy.

00:22:13.015 --> 00:22:17.680 align:middle line:90%


00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:26.100 align:middle line:84%
So we have to find a matrix
S which acts on gamma mu.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Gamma mu is some
bunch of matrices.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:33.040 align:middle line:90%
And gives you like this.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.680 align:middle line:84%
So as if the gamma mu actually--
when you act on Sophia as

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.340 align:middle line:84%
if gamma mu transforms as some
Lorentz transformation-- yeah,

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:45.540 align:middle line:90%
inverse Lorentz transformation.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:84%
So we need to-- now let's try
to find this S. So to do this,

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:57.040 align:middle line:84%
again, we use a trick which
we have been using before.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.338 align:middle line:84%
So how would you
approach this problem?

00:23:00.338 --> 00:23:03.173 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: The identity.

00:23:03.173 --> 00:23:03.840 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Yes, just do infinitesimal
transformations.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.200 align:middle line:84%
So once you learn how to do
infinitesimal transformations,

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.600 align:middle line:84%
then you always know
how to do finite ones.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And infinitesimal ones, it's
much, much easier to do.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:30.710 align:middle line:84%
So now, again, we consider
Lambda mu nu close

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:31.550 align:middle line:90%
to your identity.

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:37.840 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:84%
So that means we write
lambda mu nu as delta mu

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:49.130 align:middle line:90%
nu, which is the identity.

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Then plus omega mu nu, and
take the omega to be small.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And also remember
previously, we discussed

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.440 align:middle line:84%
that omega mu nu, when
you know the index,

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.090 align:middle line:90%
is actually antisymmetric.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:07.570 align:middle line:90%


00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is
infinitesimal, so we take

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.650 align:middle line:84%
this to be infinitesimal
and work everything

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:12.790 align:middle line:90%
to first order in omega.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:17.570 align:middle line:90%


00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:22.390 align:middle line:84%
So similarly, the
lambda minus mu

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:28.890 align:middle line:84%
nu just equal to delta
mu nu just [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:32.540 align:middle line:90%
minus omega mu nu.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, just to leading
order in omega expansion--

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.585 align:middle line:84%
the inverse metric is
just given by that.

00:24:38.585 --> 00:24:41.280 align:middle line:90%


00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.930 align:middle line:90%
So now, we can try to--

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:48.380 align:middle line:90%
so since the S--

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:52.990 align:middle line:84%
so on the right-hand
side, when lambda is close

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.430 align:middle line:90%
to the identity--

00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:01.500 align:middle line:84%
so the right-hand side
is just the gamma mu.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Just the identity
does not do anything.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Just gamma mu, and then
plus something proportional

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:07.320 align:middle line:90%
to omega.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Then, that means
that S must also--

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:14.030 align:middle line:84%
when lambda is
close to identity,

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:16.110 align:middle line:84%
it means S must also
have the structure

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:20.580 align:middle line:84%
to be identity and proportional
to something linear in omega.

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:23.910 align:middle line:84%
So the S must also
have this structure.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:27.390 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let me just
don't write the index.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.670 align:middle line:90%
Just directly write as identity.

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:36.230 align:middle line:90%


00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And then it should be something
proportional to omega mu nu.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:44.150 align:middle line:84%
So from convention,
we write this way.

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:48.010 align:middle line:84%
So it should be linear in
omega mu nu and sigma mu nu.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:51.580 align:middle line:84%
So sigma mu nu are
a bunch of matrices.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:57.600 align:middle line:84%
So remember, S is a 4x4 matrix,
and so omega mu nu is just

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.590 align:middle line:90%
some number.

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:03.490 align:middle line:84%
So this will be a
bunch of 4x4 matrices.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:06.780 align:middle line:84%
So for each omega
can in principle

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:10.500 align:middle line:84%
independently
multiply some matrix.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:14.700 align:middle line:84%
So this is the most general
way to expand this linear order

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.985 align:middle line:90%
in omega.

00:26:16.985 --> 00:26:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So this sigma essentially
just the first derivative

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:22.920 align:middle line:84%
of x with respect
to each omega mu nu.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And this i over 2
is just convention.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, the inverse
is just corresponding

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:33.945 align:middle line:84%
when you change the sign here
to leading order in omega.

00:26:33.945 --> 00:26:42.060 align:middle line:90%


00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so emphasize each
sigma mu nu is a matrix.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:59.110 align:middle line:84%
It should be understood as some
matrix in the spinor space.

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:05.430 align:middle line:90%


00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So now, you just need to
plug in this equation.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Plug in this S and S minus
1 into this equation.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just expand the
both sides to the omega,

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:19.280 align:middle line:90%
and you equate the coefficients.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.810 align:middle line:90%
You equate the coefficients.

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.840 align:middle line:84%
From that way, you
determine the sigma.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.020 align:middle line:84%
So let me call
this equation star.

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'll just call
this equation 3.

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:40.250 align:middle line:84%
So then to order omega
mu nu to linear order.

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:43.730 align:middle line:90%
Then, the equation 3, if--

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.130 align:middle line:84%
when you expand on
both sides to omega--

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:48.470 align:middle line:84%
to order of omega and
equate both sides,

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:50.100 align:middle line:84%
then you find the
following equation.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.930 align:middle line:84%
This is just a couple
of lines algebra,

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.690 align:middle line:90%
so I urge you to do it yourself.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:28:03.450 align:middle line:84%
So given by i
commutator lambda rho,

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:18.215 align:middle line:84%
gamma mu equal to eta lambda
mu gamma rho minus rho mu gamma

00:28:18.215 --> 00:28:18.715 align:middle line:90%
lambda.

00:28:18.715 --> 00:28:22.250 align:middle line:90%


00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:23.580 align:middle line:90%
So you get this equation.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:27.320 align:middle line:84%
So the left-hand side is
very easy to understand.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.260 align:middle line:90%
So essentially, you just--

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.160 align:middle line:90%
whenever you have a commutator--

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.310 align:middle line:84%
for people have done
this Baker-Hausdorff et

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:39.720 align:middle line:84%
cetera, the first order, you
always get the commutator.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's where this
commutator come from.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.030 align:middle line:84%
So the right-hand side,
when you expand this,

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:49.020 align:middle line:84%
essentially, you
just get omega mu nu

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.600 align:middle line:84%
because we have to
lower the indices.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.000 align:middle line:90%
So you have some eta here.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.340 align:middle line:84%
You have eta here,
and yeah, so that's

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.810 align:middle line:90%
how you get the right-hand side.

00:28:57.810 --> 00:28:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And the reason you
get two terms--

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:03.115 align:middle line:84%
because it should be
antisymmetric in the--

00:29:03.115 --> 00:29:03.615 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:29:03.615 --> 00:29:06.810 align:middle line:90%


00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:07.890 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:11.470 align:middle line:84%
So now, it just boils down
to solve this equation.

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:14.790 align:middle line:90%
So if we can find sigma--

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:19.670 align:middle line:84%
satisfy this equation,
and then we are done.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:23.080 align:middle line:90%


00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:27.460 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, of course, this is--

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.360 align:middle line:84%
now, you do it by
trial and error.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.225 align:middle line:90%


00:29:33.225 --> 00:29:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom line is
that there's a solution.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:40.370 align:middle line:84%
So let me just write
down the solution.

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And the nice thing
about other people

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:49.790 align:middle line:84%
found the solution is that
you can just check it.

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:52.610 align:middle line:90%
So you can check this quantity--

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:59.660 align:middle line:90%


00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.875 align:middle line:90%
this solves the equation.

00:30:00.875 --> 00:30:08.060 align:middle line:90%


00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:11.520 align:middle line:90%
So just can plug this.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.210 align:middle line:84%
So this is the commutator of
gamma lamda and gamma rho.

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:16.520 align:middle line:84%
You plug into that,
and then you just

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:25.100 align:middle line:84%
evaluate this gamma matrices
and use this kind of equation

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:30.500 align:middle line:84%
over and over, and you will
find this is satisfied.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.645 align:middle line:84%
Again, I will leave it as
an exercise for yourself.

00:30:32.645 --> 00:30:39.860 align:middle line:90%


00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:40.957 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:30:40.957 --> 00:30:42.790 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: I have a
question about this board.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:47.090 align:middle line:84%
So you start off with saying
that partial mu is transformed

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:50.370 align:middle line:84%
and that's how you get
this lambda inverse.

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Then, the last thing
is now actually--

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:58.100 align:middle line:84%
this gamma's
transformed and it's not

00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.630 align:middle line:90%
partial mu transformed.

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:01.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm a bit confused how it--

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:04.030 align:middle line:84%
it seems like you're linking
a transformation in partial mu

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:06.010 align:middle line:90%
with a transformation in--

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:07.930 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: No.

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:13.450 align:middle line:84%
So here, we want
to match 1 and 2.

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:19.120 align:middle line:84%
So the step is we do--
well, have each equation--

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.850 align:middle line:90%
from equation 1, we reach here.

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:24.500 align:middle line:90%


00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:31.090 align:middle line:84%
From equation 2, we just
plug this into there.

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And so each equation
has done one step,

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:36.100 align:middle line:90%
and then I equate them.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.600 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Right, but
I guess what I'm

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.730 align:middle line:84%
asking is equation 1 has
partial mu transformed,

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:45.600 align:middle line:84%
and then that's how you
get your lambda inverse.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And then in equation 2, you
are transforming your gamma.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:55.690 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, we
want to show this--

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:59.770 align:middle line:84%
you want to match this
equation with this equation.

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:01.720 align:middle line:90%
This equation is derived from 1.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.220 align:middle line:90%
So we want to derive--

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:06.870 align:middle line:90%
we want to find the 2 from 1.

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:07.920 align:middle line:90%
This is equation 1.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.380 align:middle line:84%
So I just slightly
rewrite the equation 2

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:14.640 align:middle line:84%
by inserting this transformation
here, then I matched them.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:19.600 align:middle line:90%


00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.470 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:24.920 align:middle line:90%


00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:25.690 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:40.140 align:middle line:90%


00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:43.230 align:middle line:90%
So now, we can just--

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:48.390 align:middle line:84%
now we can just immediately--
so given this equation,

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:53.010 align:middle line:84%
and now we can immediately
write the final transformation.

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:57.770 align:middle line:84%
So with the finite
transformation--

00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:07.775 align:middle line:84%
so for each lambda
mu nu, each finite--

00:33:07.775 --> 00:33:11.330 align:middle line:90%


00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:16.760 align:middle line:84%
you can obtain the
corresponding omega mu nu,

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.245 align:middle line:90%
and then this is also finite.

00:33:18.245 --> 00:33:21.230 align:middle line:90%


00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And now, we can just obtain
the S by exponentiating this.

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And then the
corresponding S would

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:39.980 align:middle line:84%
be S equal to exponential minus
i over 2 omega mu nu sigma.

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And the sigma mu nu is
just given by this one.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.350 align:middle line:90%
And you can check yourself.

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:54.040 align:middle line:84%
This satisfies-- you can check
this satisfies equation 3.

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.820 align:middle line:90%


00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:00.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's finite equation.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:06.940 align:middle line:90%


00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:07.440 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:17.570 align:middle line:90%


00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:20.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:22.010 align:middle line:90%
So now, let me--

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:29.010 align:middle line:90%


00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:32.609 align:middle line:84%
was there some-- so now,
let's make some remarks.

00:34:32.609 --> 00:34:38.190 align:middle line:90%


00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:45.449 align:middle line:84%
So then this S,
it just generates

00:34:45.449 --> 00:35:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Lorentz transformation
in spinor space

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:05.130 align:middle line:84%
because it only act on
this alpha and beta.

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:13.620 align:middle line:90%


00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:17.190 align:middle line:90%
So sigma i j--

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:23.120 align:middle line:84%
or sigma mu nu according to
our standard terminology,

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:28.930 align:middle line:84%
this is called the generator
of the transformation.

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:30.560 align:middle line:90%
So these are the generators.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:37.280 align:middle line:90%


00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:43.520 align:middle line:90%
So when omega mu nu--

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:47.390 align:middle line:84%
when the mu nu equal to spatial
directions, and then that's

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:49.520 align:middle line:90%
corresponding to a spacetime--

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:54.860 align:middle line:84%
spatial rotation and the 0
i corresponding to a boost.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.630 align:middle line:90%
So remember.

00:35:56.630 --> 00:36:04.110 align:middle line:84%
So that means for
sigma ij, which

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:14.700 align:middle line:84%
is i equal to 4,
gamma i, gamma j--

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:24.910 align:middle line:84%
this generates
generators of rotations.

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:29.150 align:middle line:90%


00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:33.250 align:middle line:84%
So remember, previously--
so if you remember

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:35.560 align:middle line:84%
how we do the Lorentz
transformation,

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:42.490 align:middle line:84%
the omega ij would correspond to
the rotational angle in the ij

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:43.930 align:middle line:90%
plane.

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So you just rotate in the
ij plane by angle omega ij.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So then this just
corresponding now--

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:59.215 align:middle line:84%
corresponding to the generator
of the rotations in ij plane.

00:36:59.215 --> 00:37:04.690 align:middle line:90%


00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So you can-- because the gamma
i and the gamma j are Hermitian,

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:14.750 align:middle line:84%
recall that the
gamma i is Hermitian.

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And then the sigma
ij is also Hermitian

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:24.380 align:middle line:84%
because when you take
the dagger of this i

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:26.960 align:middle line:84%
gives you a minus sign,
but the commutator

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:30.350 align:middle line:90%
gives you a minus sign.

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:32.240 align:middle line:90%
and so this is Hermitian.

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:43.220 align:middle line:84%
So that means that S, which
corresponding to rotation,

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:44.750 align:middle line:90%
is unitary.

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:46.550 align:middle line:90%
So this is unitary.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:48.245 align:middle line:90%
So this is a unitary matrix.

00:37:48.245 --> 00:37:56.560 align:middle line:90%


00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So now let's consider
the sigma 0 i,

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.980 align:middle line:84%
which corresponding to
the generator for boost.

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.040 align:middle line:90%


00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.250 align:middle line:84%
So this will have the
form gamma 0 gamma

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:13.100 align:middle line:84%
i, so this is the
generators for boost.

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:19.970 align:middle line:90%


00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:30.240 align:middle line:84%
In i-th direction
in the spinor space.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And now, because the--
remember gamma 0,

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:35.990 align:middle line:84%
when you take the dagger,
you get the minus sign.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:40.460 align:middle line:84%
So the sigma 0 i, now
if you take the dagger,

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.310 align:middle line:84%
you actually also get the
minus sign because the--

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:46.022 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so now it's
anti-Hermitian.

00:38:46.022 --> 00:38:49.810 align:middle line:90%


00:38:49.810 --> 00:39:00.720 align:middle line:84%
So that means the
boost matrices--

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.985 align:middle line:84%
so this is a boost
transformation--

00:39:02.985 --> 00:39:12.390 align:middle line:90%


00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:14.060 align:middle line:90%
so this is not unitary.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:25.370 align:middle line:90%


00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:27.830 align:middle line:90%
So this is not unitary.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:31.130 align:middle line:84%
So in general-- so normally,
as we said before, normally,

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:33.620 align:middle line:84%
when you do a symmetry
transformation,

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:35.870 align:middle line:84%
the transformation is a
unitary transformation.

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:37.970 align:middle line:84%
But in this case,
actually-- yeah,

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:41.180 align:middle line:84%
this is a classical
transformation.

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Here, it's actually
not a unitary matrix.

00:39:46.130 --> 00:40:24.350 align:middle line:84%
So this implies that
S dagger, in general--

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:28.550 align:middle line:84%
for general Lorentz
transformation, say,

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:31.685 align:middle line:84%
which including both
rotation boost--

00:40:31.685 --> 00:40:38.480 align:middle line:90%


00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.030 align:middle line:84%
say S and S dagger
is not equal to 1.

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:45.400 align:middle line:90%


00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:49.600 align:middle line:90%
S dagger-- S is not equal to 1.

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.800 align:middle line:84%
So this has very
important consequences,

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:56.020 align:middle line:84%
for example, for
writing down the action

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:57.895 align:middle line:90%
for the Dirac equation.

00:40:57.895 --> 00:41:03.340 align:middle line:84%
So so far, we only wrote
down the Dirac equation,

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:06.730 align:middle line:84%
but we did-- remember,
previously, we normally

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:09.490 align:middle line:84%
started with the action first,
and then from the action,

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:11.080 align:middle line:84%
we derive the
equation of motion.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:16.660 align:middle line:84%
But in this case,
since this spinor

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.520 align:middle line:84%
is a completely new
concept, we started

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.860 align:middle line:90%
with actually the equation.

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:23.500 align:middle line:84%
But now, if we want to
write down an action--

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:26.350 align:middle line:84%
which is by definition, it
should be Lorentz invariant--

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:30.370 align:middle line:84%
then we should
construct quantities

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:33.310 align:middle line:84%
which are invariant under
Lorentz transformations.

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And so this property
then becomes a key.

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:41.620 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So like, we're--
so these are operators

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:45.770 align:middle line:84%
on the spinor space, and we're
talking about Hermiticity

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:46.270 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:50.130 align:middle line:84%
But Hermitian is with
respect to an inner product,

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:51.210 align:middle line:90%
and we haven't talked--

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:52.140 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, here,
we are not talking

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.250 align:middle line:90%
about quantum mechanics.

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Here, we're just talking
about the equations--

00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:57.552 align:middle line:90%
classical equations.

00:41:57.552 --> 00:41:59.010 align:middle line:84%
We are just talking
about-- they're

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:01.050 align:middle line:90%
matrix-- they're just matrix.

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:04.530 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about whether
they are unitary matrix

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:08.730 align:middle line:90%
or they are not unitary matrix.

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:10.470 align:middle line:84%
They are just
ordinary matrices--

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:11.595 align:middle line:90%
4x4 matrices.

00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:17.490 align:middle line:90%


00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:18.390 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:27.350 align:middle line:90%


00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:36.820 align:middle line:90%
So that means psi dagger psi--

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:41.560 align:middle line:84%
so psi dagger is a row vector,
and this is a column vector,

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.350 align:middle line:90%
and altogether this is a number.

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:46.290 align:middle line:84%
So this means this
is not a scalar.

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:49.440 align:middle line:90%


00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:52.230 align:middle line:84%
So this transform under
Lorentz transformation

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:56.670 align:middle line:90%
as psi dagger S dagger S psi.

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:59.520 align:middle line:84%
So that means this is not--
since this is not equal to 1,

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:08.040 align:middle line:84%
then this is not scalar under
the Lorentz transformation.

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:20.450 align:middle line:90%


00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:24.450 align:middle line:84%
So now, we have to search
a little bit harder

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:31.230 align:middle line:90%
to find the scalar.

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So in order to
write the action, we

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:36.315 align:middle line:84%
need to find something which
is invariant under the Lorentz

00:43:36.315 --> 00:43:38.750 align:middle line:90%
transformation.

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:40.810 align:middle line:84%
So the easiest
thing to think about

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:43.540 align:middle line:84%
is this quantity, because
this automatically

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.280 align:middle line:90%
gives you a number.

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:50.480 align:middle line:84%
But this thing won't work, so we
have to search it a bit harder.

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.760 align:middle line:90%
So to do that, let's--

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:57.140 align:middle line:84%
we can get some hint from
the following identity.

00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:02.490 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at what
this S dagger really is.

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:04.470 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the
property of S dagger.

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:11.330 align:middle line:90%


00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:13.010 align:middle line:90%
So recall that the--

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:17.040 align:middle line:84%
I think I erased it, so
let me just write it again.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:26.290 align:middle line:84%
So gamma mu dagger is equal
to gamma 0 gamma mu gamma 0.

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's try to
find what mu nu dagger.

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:32.950 align:middle line:84%
So let's write mu nu
dagger in the uniform--

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:36.260 align:middle line:84%
so even though we
wrote it separately.

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:39.710 align:middle line:84%
So you can easily check yourself
because of this property.

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:45.660 align:middle line:84%
So this is just given by minus
gamma 0 sigma mu nu gamma 0.

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:48.680 align:middle line:90%


00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
just a commutator,

00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:56.960 align:middle line:84%
so you can easily work it
out that you just get this.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.720 align:middle line:84%
So now we can find
what S dagger.

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.450 align:middle line:90%


00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:11.050 align:middle line:84%
So S dagger is equal to
the exponential 1/2 i omega

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:14.230 align:middle line:90%
mu nu, then sigma mu nu dagger.

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:20.160 align:middle line:90%


00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And then this is equal to i
over 2 omega mu nu minus gamma 0

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.920 align:middle line:90%
sigma mu nu gamma 0.

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:43.860 align:middle line:90%


00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:50.320 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you remember, gamma
0 squared is equal to minus 1.

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.030 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you have
such a situation--

00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:56.590 align:middle line:84%
and because gamma 0 squared
is equal to minus 1,

00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:58.930 align:middle line:84%
then you can actually
take the gamma 0 outside

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:00.190 align:middle line:90%
of the exponential.

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:09.220 align:middle line:84%
So this is actually equal to
minus gamma 0 exponential i

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:13.260 align:middle line:84%
over q comma 0 mu
nu sigma mu nu.

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:21.020 align:middle line:90%


00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:23.030 align:middle line:84%
So if you just think--
you do a Taylor

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:27.500 align:middle line:84%
expansion of this
exponential, and then

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:34.380 align:middle line:84%
when you take the power of
this, then for each term,

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:38.740 align:middle line:84%
the gamma 0 at the end
will pair with a gamma 0

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.410 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning
of the other term,

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:44.470 align:middle line:90%
and then they give you minus 1.

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And then you have only the first
gamma 0 and the last gamma 0

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.180 align:middle line:90%
left.

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And because that
gives a minus 1,

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.620 align:middle line:84%
that changes this minus
sign to a plus sign.

00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:55.840 align:middle line:84%
So you just do a Taylor
expansion you will find here.

00:46:55.840 --> 00:47:00.010 align:middle line:90%


00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And now, we find
the nice relation.

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:07.060 align:middle line:84%
So we find that this
is just minus gamma 0,

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:11.275 align:middle line:84%
and this is just equal
to S minus 1 S gamma 0.

00:47:11.275 --> 00:47:14.590 align:middle line:90%


00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:16.890 align:middle line:84%
So we find that the
S dagger is actually

00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:19.215 align:middle line:90%
minus gamma 0 S minus 1.

00:47:19.215 --> 00:47:22.110 align:middle line:90%


00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Then, this tells us
from this property--

00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:32.050 align:middle line:90%


00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:37.770 align:middle line:84%
tells us that this
quantity psi dagger

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:44.270 align:middle line:84%
gamma 0 psi should
transform as a scalar.

00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:48.390 align:middle line:90%
So now, let's take a look.

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So this, when you do
a transformation--

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:56.180 align:middle line:84%
so this gives you the
psi dagger S dagger.

00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Then, you have gamma
0, then you have S psi

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:02.150 align:middle line:90%
under Lorentz transformation.

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:04.310 align:middle line:90%
And now, you plug this into--

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:08.480 align:middle line:84%
plug in S dagger equal
to this into here.

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:15.220 align:middle line:84%
You just get minus
psi dagger, so this

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:24.040 align:middle line:84%
is gamma 0 S dagger S minus 1
gamma 0, then gamma 0 S psi.

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:27.940 align:middle line:84%
So this gives you minus 1--
cancels with the 1 here.

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:30.075 align:middle line:90%
And the S one cancels with--

00:48:30.075 --> 00:48:37.090 align:middle line:84%
S minus 1 cancels with S, and
then you have dagger goes here.

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:40.133 align:middle line:84%
So this actually is
Lorentz invariant.

00:48:40.133 --> 00:48:44.560 align:middle line:90%


00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So now, we find a nice
Lorentz invariant quantity.

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So since we use
this all the time,

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:58.275 align:middle line:84%
it's convenient to
introduce a new notation.

00:48:58.275 --> 00:49:20.880 align:middle line:90%


00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:34.620 align:middle line:84%
So now, I introduce --
convenient to introduce recall

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:40.830 align:middle line:90%
psi bar equal to psi dagger.

00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:42.810 align:middle line:84%
So here, it's all
just clustered.

00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:48.390 align:middle line:84%
This is dagger, and it's all
just matrix manipulation.

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we're considering
a classical theory,

00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:56.190 align:middle line:84%
and so it's convenient to
introduce objects like this.

00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:59.880 align:middle line:90%
And then we know that psi bar--

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:03.200 align:middle line:90%
psi is a scalar.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:06.750 align:middle line:84%
So that thing just
becomes psi bar and psi.

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:09.570 align:middle line:90%


00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:13.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's convenient
to work out the--

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:16.980 align:middle line:84%
how psi bar
transforms by itself.

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:20.970 align:middle line:84%
So you just use this relation
so you can check yourself.

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:24.180 align:middle line:84%
So as an exercise for
you to check yourself

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:27.630 align:middle line:84%
under Lorentz
transformation psi bar

00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:34.990 align:middle line:84%
x is equal to psi
bar prime x prime.

00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:38.170 align:middle line:84%
So if you go to the new
psi bar prime x prime

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:44.410 align:middle line:90%
is equal to psi bar x S minus 1.

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:47.245 align:middle line:84%
So you can easily check
yourself this relation.

00:50:47.245 --> 00:50:53.070 align:middle line:90%


00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, using
this transformation

00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:58.800 align:middle line:84%
of gamma partial
mu, you can also

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:07.410 align:middle line:84%
check that the gamma
mu partial mu so prime

00:51:07.410 --> 00:51:16.310 align:middle line:84%
psi prime x prime equal to
S gamma mu partial mu psi.

00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:19.480 align:middle line:90%


00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:21.812 align:middle line:90%
So you can also check yourself--

00:51:21.812 --> 00:51:22.645 align:middle line:90%
check this equation.

00:51:22.645 --> 00:51:29.580 align:middle line:90%


00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:34.710 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, just by using these
properties of S dagger.

00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just-- yeah, this,
you don't use the--

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:39.690 align:middle line:84%
you only use for
above the S dagger.

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Just use how partial
mu prime transform

00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and how psi transform, and
then you can show this is true.

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:51.010 align:middle line:90%


00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:53.000 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.190 align:middle line:84%
So this-- also this
gamma mu partial mu

00:51:57.190 --> 00:52:01.130 align:middle line:84%
will appear a lot because this
appears in the Dirac equation.

00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:05.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's convenient to
introduce a new notation.

00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Say gamma mu partial mu we
define to be partial slash.

00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:19.600 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, anything
slash corresponding

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:21.400 align:middle line:84%
to that thing contract
with gamma mu.

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:24.750 align:middle line:90%


00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And then this
equation then can be

00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:32.460 align:middle line:84%
written as the partial
prime slash psi

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:38.582 align:middle line:84%
prime x prime equal to
S partial slash psi x.

00:52:38.582 --> 00:52:47.970 align:middle line:90%


00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:48.470 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:55.320 align:middle line:90%


00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:57.420 align:middle line:84%
So let me just
mention one more thing

00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:00.030 align:middle line:90%
you can work out yourself.

00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:03.030 align:middle line:90%
So you can check--

00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:07.500 align:middle line:84%
so these are all things you
can check yourself once you

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.810 align:middle line:90%
equip those transformations.

00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:19.290 align:middle line:84%
You can also check that
gamma psi bar gamma mu

00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:21.705 align:middle line:90%
psi transforms as a vector.

00:53:21.705 --> 00:53:36.400 align:middle line:90%


00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:44.590 align:middle line:84%
That means psi bar prime
x prime gamma mu psi prime

00:53:44.590 --> 00:54:00.700 align:middle line:84%
x prime is equal to lambda mu
nu psi bar x gamma nu psi x.

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:03.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you view this
whole thing as a vector,

00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:07.740 align:middle line:84%
and then you see the
prime-- the quantity

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:11.770 align:middle line:84%
is equal to just a
Lorentz transformation

00:54:11.770 --> 00:54:13.770 align:middle line:90%
lambda on itself.

00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:17.317 align:middle line:90%


00:54:17.317 --> 00:54:18.900 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is
something just based

00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:21.300 align:middle line:84%
on the transformations
of S and the relations

00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:25.980 align:middle line:84%
between different gamma
matrices you can just show that.

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:30.030 align:middle line:90%


00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:30.530 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:31.447 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:54:31.447 --> 00:54:39.010 align:middle line:90%


00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:40.900 align:middle line:84%
So now, with these
preparations, we

00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:45.040 align:middle line:84%
can now write down the
actions which gives rise

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:45.985 align:middle line:90%
to the Dirac equation.

00:54:45.985 --> 00:54:50.650 align:middle line:90%


00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can write
down the Dirac action.

00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:57.900 align:middle line:90%


00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:00.040 align:middle line:84%
The action which gives
rise to the Dirac equation.

00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So I will just write
down the answer.

00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:04.390 align:middle line:90%
It's very intuitive.

00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So you have just essentially
S equal to minus i d4 x

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:23.110 align:middle line:84%
psi bar gamma mu
partial mu minus m psi.

00:55:23.110 --> 00:55:24.235 align:middle line:90%
So this is the answer.

00:55:24.235 --> 00:55:32.400 align:middle line:90%


00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:38.820 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so there are various
things to uncompact here.

00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:43.380 align:middle line:84%
So first, just based on those
relations, based on this

00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:52.640 align:middle line:84%
is a scalar, this is a scalar,
and the transformation of this,

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:55.400 align:middle line:84%
you can immediately see that
this is a Lorentz scalar

00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:58.610 align:middle line:84%
because it only involves two
variables-- one quantities--

00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:01.820 align:middle line:84%
psi bar, psi with this
m term, and then psi bar

00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:03.440 align:middle line:90%
gamma mu partial mu psi.

00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.990 align:middle line:90%
And that we already show here--

00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:09.620 align:middle line:90%
that the transform as S.

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:11.750 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, you can
easily check just

00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:14.480 align:middle line:84%
based on those equations
that this is a scalar.

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:18.630 align:middle line:90%
And this is Lorentz invariant.

00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:25.440 align:middle line:84%
So the second thing is
that this i here is for--

00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:30.450 align:middle line:84%
to make the action
is real, because you

00:56:30.450 --> 00:56:32.830 align:middle line:84%
can show if you take the
complex conjugate of this,

00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:36.240 align:middle line:84%
you actually get the
minus sign, and so

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:38.880 align:middle line:90%
you need the i to make it real.

00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And this minus sign, which
cannot be explained now,

00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:47.100 align:middle line:84%
which we will talk about
it later when we quantize

00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:50.430 align:middle line:84%
the theory and we see actually,
we need to put the minus sign

00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:51.390 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:52.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:57.630 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: And the definition of
psi bar has psi dagger gamma 0.

00:56:57.630 --> 00:56:59.850 align:middle line:84%
It feels like we're
singling out the time

00:56:59.850 --> 00:57:03.930 align:middle line:84%
dimension and the
definition, because gamma 0--

00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:06.780 align:middle line:84%
is that true that we're
singling out the time dimension?

00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:09.120 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: We are not
really singling out

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:11.790 align:middle line:90%
the time direction.

00:57:11.790 --> 00:57:15.450 align:middle line:84%
just due to the property that
gamma 0 is not a Hermitian.

00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just because if you
look at all this complicate--

00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:24.000 align:middle line:84%
just related to that
this S dagger is not--

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.860 align:middle line:90%
yeah, S is not unitary.

00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And the reason S is not unitary
is because gamma 0 is not

00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:30.010 align:middle line:90%
a hermitian.

00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so you have to put in
the gamma 0 in various places

00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:36.205 align:middle line:90%
to compensate for that.

00:57:36.205 --> 00:57:41.933 align:middle line:90%


00:57:41.933 --> 00:57:42.600 align:middle line:90%
Other questions.

00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:43.365 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:57:43.365 --> 00:57:46.650 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So I guess the
action, if you wanted a Lorentz

00:57:46.650 --> 00:57:48.510 align:middle line:84%
invariant-- a
Lorentz scalar, you

00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:51.390 align:middle line:84%
could have constructed some
dot product of that object that

00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:54.840 align:middle line:90%
transforms as a vector, right?

00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:57.990 align:middle line:84%
So the psi bar gamma-- so that
would be allowed in principle.

00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:59.490 align:middle line:84%
I guess this gives
the right answer,

00:57:59.490 --> 00:58:02.458 align:middle line:84%
but that could've
appeared in the action.

00:58:02.458 --> 00:58:04.500 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Which-- yeah,
this appeared in action.

00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this is the-- so
because this is a vector--

00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:10.470 align:middle line:84%
so when this contracts
with partial mu,

00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:14.320 align:middle line:90%
that gives you a scalar.

00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that
gives you a scalar.

00:58:16.890 --> 00:58:19.390 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, you can
understand that this is--

00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:23.640 align:middle line:84%
in both ways, this transform--
the fact this transform vector

00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:25.740 align:middle line:90%
is also related to here.

00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:26.675 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just-- yeah.

00:58:26.675 --> 00:58:30.770 align:middle line:90%


00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:32.490 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:58:32.490 --> 00:58:33.852 align:middle line:90%
So-- yes?

00:58:33.852 --> 00:58:36.435 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: To follow up on that,
if I contract that with itself,

00:58:36.435 --> 00:58:38.102 align:middle line:84%
would it give like
another [INAUDIBLE]..

00:58:38.102 --> 00:58:43.293 align:middle line:90%


00:58:43.293 --> 00:58:43.960 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: What?

00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:46.930 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: if I contract that
[INAUDIBLE] with itself.

00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:53.800 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but then
you will have four psi's.

00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:57.478 align:middle line:84%
So four psi's will give you
rise to an interacting theory.

00:58:57.478 --> 00:58:58.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's right.

00:58:58.270 --> 00:59:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Here, I'm writing down
a free theory right now.

00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:05.110 align:middle line:90%


00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So you can also see that
this equation gives rise

00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:11.480 align:middle line:90%
to the Dirac equation.

00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine psi bar
is independent of psi,

00:59:14.030 --> 00:59:15.860 align:middle line:84%
because this corresponding
to psi dagger.

00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:17.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you do the
variation of this one,

00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:20.510 align:middle line:84%
you just automatically
get the Dirac equation.

00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Then you can also easily
check by integration by part.

00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you were psi, you get
the complex conjugate version

00:59:28.070 --> 00:59:32.780 align:middle line:84%
of the Dirac equation
acting on psi bar.

00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:35.870 align:middle line:84%
So now let me just
say a few words

00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:37.760 align:middle line:90%
on why you need the i here.

00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:39.590 align:middle line:90%
So you can check.

00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:41.810 align:middle line:84%
So here, I'm listing
some relations.

00:59:41.810 --> 00:59:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Again, each of them, you need
to really write down the paper

00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:49.340 align:middle line:84%
yourself, stare at it, maybe do
a derivation to get intuition

00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:50.210 align:middle line:90%
about yourself.

00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Right now, I'm just writing
down those relations.

00:59:53.210 --> 01:00:00.380 align:middle line:84%
So you can also check
yourself that when

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:07.520 align:middle line:84%
you take the psi bar
psi dagger, again,

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.070 align:middle line:84%
just go through
all these things.

01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:13.670 align:middle line:84%
You find it's equal
to minus psi bar psi.

01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:17.100 align:middle line:90%
So this is just two lines here.

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:20.640 align:middle line:84%
I will not write them
explicitly for you.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, you can
check related to this--

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:31.230 align:middle line:84%
the other term that
the gamma psi bar

01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:35.620 align:middle line:90%
gamma mu partial mu psi--

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:37.480 align:middle line:90%
if you take the dagger--

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:41.920 align:middle line:84%
so here-- so this one is
slightly more complicated,

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.150 align:middle line:90%
but you can still--

01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:44.830 align:middle line:90%
you can just walk it through.

01:00:44.830 --> 01:00:54.090 align:middle line:84%
You find it's just equal
to negative of itself,

01:00:54.090 --> 01:00:57.130 align:middle line:90%
then plus total derivatives.

01:00:57.130 --> 01:00:59.010 align:middle line:84%
So this one is not
exactly minus sign,

01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:01.140 align:middle line:84%
but you have to throw away
some total derivatives.

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:03.960 align:middle line:84%
So total derivatives
which give you--

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.590 align:middle line:84%
when you plug into
the action, it

01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:10.710 align:middle line:84%
gives rise to boundary terms,
but it will always assume

01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:13.800 align:middle line:90%
the field vanish at infinity.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:17.460 align:middle line:84%
So that explains why you
need this i, because when

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:21.870 align:middle line:84%
you take the complex conjugate
of the quantity here,

01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:middle line:90%
you always get the minus sign.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.750 align:middle line:90%


01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:27.250 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:28.210 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:39.570 align:middle line:90%


01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:40.770 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:01:40.770 --> 01:01:43.110 align:middle line:84%
So now, it's getting
a little bit awkward

01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:45.840 align:middle line:90%
because our printer today broke.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:49.930 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't bring
enough of my notes,

01:01:49.930 --> 01:01:54.960 align:middle line:84%
so now I have to look at my
computer to remember my notes.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:02:00.605 align:middle line:90%


01:02:00.605 --> 01:02:01.105 align:middle line:90%
One second.

01:02:01.105 --> 01:02:06.820 align:middle line:90%


01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:08.970 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:02:08.970 --> 01:02:09.470 align:middle line:90%
Ugh.

01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:24.760 align:middle line:90%


01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.930 align:middle line:90%
I have to find the location.

01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:41.570 align:middle line:90%


01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:43.080 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.740 align:middle line:90%
So any questions on this?

01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:47.240 align:middle line:90%
No?

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:50.670 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now let's move
to the next topic.

01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So now, this concludes
our discussion

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.020 align:middle line:90%
of the Dirac equation.

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:59.660 align:middle line:84%
So we have derived the
Dirac equation by--

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:03.230 align:middle line:84%
and also we have discussed
how various quantities

01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:07.550 align:middle line:84%
in Dirac equation should
transform, and also

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:08.840 align:middle line:90%
finally the Dirac action.

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:11.540 align:middle line:90%


01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:14.000 align:middle line:90%
So the next step--

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.150 align:middle line:84%
the logical next
step is to quantize

01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:18.650 align:middle line:84%
to go to the quantum
field theory.

01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:21.920 align:middle line:84%
So right now, so far,
everything is classical.

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:27.170 align:middle line:84%
So now, the next step is that
we want to quantize this theory.

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And when we quantize
the theory, we

01:03:29.570 --> 01:03:33.860 align:middle line:90%
will see remarkably fermions.

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:35.300 align:middle line:90%
So we will see fermions.

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:38.240 align:middle line:90%
We will see Pauli principle.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:42.890 align:middle line:84%
But before-- but
as we said before,

01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:47.550 align:middle line:84%
that when we quantize the
theory, we first need to--

01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:50.100 align:middle line:84%
the simplest way
is to first find

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:53.730 align:middle line:84%
this all is classical
solutions, and then

01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:55.650 align:middle line:84%
the classical solutions
then become solutions

01:03:55.650 --> 01:03:57.840 align:middle line:84%
to the operator
equations, and then we

01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.910 align:middle line:90%
can automatically quantize.

01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:03.810 align:middle line:84%
So then before, we actually
do the quantization.

01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:08.250 align:middle line:84%
It's better we try to find
all the classical solutions

01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:10.380 align:middle line:90%
of Dirac equation.

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not like a
Klein-Gordon equation--

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:15.140 align:middle line:84%
we can just immediately
write down the solutions.

01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And the Dirac equation is a
little bit more intricate,

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:23.960 align:middle line:84%
so we need to spend a little bit
of effort to write down the--

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:27.620 align:middle line:84%
to find all the solutions
of the Dirac equations.

01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:30.110 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we will do.

01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we are not
going to finish today,

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:38.670 align:middle line:84%
and then we will have
a long spring break.

01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:44.370 align:middle line:84%
So I hope you still remember
what we talked about today when

01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:45.045 align:middle line:90%
you come back.

01:04:45.045 --> 01:04:54.510 align:middle line:90%


01:04:54.510 --> 01:05:06.190 align:middle line:90%
So this is [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:09.640 align:middle line:84%
So now, we have
classical solutions.

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:19.300 align:middle line:90%


01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:26.440 align:middle line:84%
So by construction, the
Dirac equation has solutions.

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:29.620 align:middle line:90%


01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:31.660 align:middle line:84%
We know must be
proportional to e to the i k

01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:38.470 align:middle line:84%
x with k squared equal
to minus m squared.

01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:39.670 align:middle line:90%
So this is by construction.

01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Because we square it, we get
the Klein-Gordon equation.

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:52.060 align:middle line:84%
So this k mu would
be omega k and k.

01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:56.870 align:middle line:90%


01:05:56.870 --> 01:06:01.760 align:middle line:84%
But this is not enough
because the Dirac equation--

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:04.940 align:middle line:84%
because psi have
four components.

01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:08.220 align:middle line:84%
So this just determines
one factor of it.

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And we also have
to determine it's--

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:14.180 align:middle line:84%
the behavior of all
its four components.

01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And so now, that's we
are going to do now.

01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:22.770 align:middle line:84%
So we will separate the
solutions into two types.

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:27.870 align:middle line:84%
So one type is we call psi
plus x, which corresponding

01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:33.760 align:middle line:90%
to uk x, the expression ik x.

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And another we call
the psi minus x,

01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:40.900 align:middle line:90%
which corresponding to vk x.

01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:42.400 align:middle line:90%
vk-- yeah, sorry--

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:45.680 align:middle line:90%
no x-- because it's minus ik x.

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:49.950 align:middle line:90%


01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so uk vk,
they just-- they're

01:06:53.550 --> 01:06:59.280 align:middle line:84%
all four-component spinors which
have the same thing as psi,

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.240 align:middle line:84%
because this is
just some number.

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:03.720 align:middle line:90%
So because this is--

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:07.528 align:middle line:84%
because k have the
positive frequency,

01:07:07.528 --> 01:07:09.945 align:middle line:84%
so this is some kind of--
called positive energy solution.

01:07:09.945 --> 01:07:14.820 align:middle line:90%


01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is called the
negative energy solution.

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:22.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's the same thing
as in the scalar case.

01:07:22.410 --> 01:07:25.568 align:middle line:84%
They don't really--
there's not really--

01:07:25.568 --> 01:07:27.360 align:middle line:84%
when we quantize the
theory, there's really

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:31.770 align:middle line:90%
no negative energy excitations.

01:07:31.770 --> 01:07:33.360 align:middle line:90%
It's just a name.

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:36.330 align:middle line:84%
So we call the positive
energy and negative energy

01:07:36.330 --> 01:07:37.350 align:middle line:90%
just a name.

01:07:37.350 --> 01:07:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So the actual
physical excitations

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:42.240 align:middle line:90%
always have positive energy.

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And this uk and vk, they are all
four-component complex vectors.

01:07:52.890 --> 01:08:01.420 align:middle line:90%


01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:02.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:08.140 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So it seems like the
psi should be labeled by k.

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:13.990 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, psi-- so this
is just the basis of solutions.

01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:16.165 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, we should
label them by k.

01:08:16.165 --> 01:08:19.649 align:middle line:90%


01:08:19.649 --> 01:08:20.149 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:24.050 align:middle line:84%
So this-- so
essentially, we just--

01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:26.029 align:middle line:84%
in the scalar case,
you just expand it

01:08:26.029 --> 01:08:29.640 align:middle line:84%
in terms of plane wave, and
then you just get some constant.

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:33.390 align:middle line:84%
So here, its a little bit
indicate we have a vector.

01:08:33.390 --> 01:08:35.016 align:middle line:84%
Now, we need to
solve these vectors.

01:08:35.016 --> 01:08:36.599 align:middle line:84%
So our goal is to
solve these vectors.

01:08:36.599 --> 01:08:39.609 align:middle line:90%


01:08:39.609 --> 01:08:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you just plug them
into the Dirac equation.

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Just plug these two
into the Dirac equation,

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:52.149 align:middle line:84%
and then you get the equations
for the uk and the vk.

01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And I will also
suppress the k in the uv

01:08:55.450 --> 01:08:59.470 align:middle line:84%
and v just for
notational simplicity.

01:08:59.470 --> 01:09:02.920 align:middle line:90%
So when you have the gamma mu--

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:06.430 align:middle line:84%
partial mu minus
m, psi equal to 0,

01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:09.490 align:middle line:84%
you just plug the
psi plus minus m,

01:09:09.490 --> 01:09:14.500 align:middle line:84%
and then you find that the
following equations for u

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:19.450 align:middle line:84%
if you get i k slash
minus m u equal to 0,

01:09:19.450 --> 01:09:24.890 align:middle line:84%
and the i k slash
and the minus--

01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:27.560 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I think-- let me
just double-check the sign.

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:28.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, indeed.

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:34.490 align:middle line:84%
So you get i k slash
plus m V equal to 0.

01:09:34.490 --> 01:09:36.510 align:middle line:90%
So you get these two equations.

01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:39.500 align:middle line:84%
So our goal is just to
solve those equations.

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And the k slash, just as
defined before, it just

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:52.356 align:middle line:84%
defines as in the partial slash
k slash equal to mu gamma.

01:09:52.356 --> 01:09:58.080 align:middle line:90%


01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:59.610 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:09:59.610 --> 01:10:02.120 align:middle line:84%
So you can also work out
the complex conjugate.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:06.230 align:middle line:84%
So let me just write
down the equations,

01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:08.960 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes they
will be used later.

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:14.750 align:middle line:84%
So the u bar i k slash
minus m equal to 0,

01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:15.980 align:middle line:90%
the complex conjugate.

01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:20.000 align:middle line:90%
And v bar i k slash plus m.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:33.480 align:middle line:90%


01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:41.770 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's try to work
out the uk and the vk

01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:45.450 align:middle line:90%
by solving those equations.

01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:50.830 align:middle line:90%
So we do this by--

01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:54.890 align:middle line:84%
you can, in principle,
do it by brute force.

01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:57.360 align:middle line:90%
So after all, you just--

01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:59.760 align:middle line:90%
these are just 4x4 equations--

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:02.940 align:middle line:90%
4x4 matrix equations.

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:04.200 align:middle line:90%
Just linear algebra.

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:08.470 align:middle line:84%
You can-- in principle,
we can solve it.

01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:11.580 align:middle line:84%
But the physicists are
often lazy, so we often--

01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:14.610 align:middle line:84%
still even for the
problem, you can solve--

01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:16.650 align:middle line:90%
we still look for shortcuts.

01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And so in this case, there
are two possible shortcuts.

01:11:19.570 --> 01:11:23.310 align:middle line:84%
There are two possible
ways we can do, and so

01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:26.110 align:middle line:90%
let me describe both ways.

01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I think we only
have time to describe one way.

01:11:30.250 --> 01:11:39.820 align:middle line:84%
So to find the explicit
form of u and v--

01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:43.710 align:middle line:90%


01:11:43.710 --> 01:11:45.630 align:middle line:84%
so one simple thing
to do is let's

01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:47.850 align:middle line:84%
just consider in
the simple case--

01:11:47.850 --> 01:11:49.830 align:middle line:84%
say, consider the
particle is at rest.

01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:53.550 align:middle line:90%


01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:56.250 align:middle line:84%
When the particle is
at rest, then the omega

01:11:56.250 --> 01:12:01.740 align:middle line:84%
is just equal to m,
and then k equal to 0.

01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And then that
equation just becomes

01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:12.638 align:middle line:84%
i m gamma 0 minus m
u equal to 0 and i

01:12:12.638 --> 01:12:18.740 align:middle line:90%
m gamma 0 plus m v equal to 0.

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:21.700 align:middle line:90%


01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:23.350 align:middle line:90%
I think-- do I--

01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:28.590 align:middle line:90%


01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:31.770 align:middle line:90%
so I think the mu--

01:12:31.770 --> 01:12:32.520 align:middle line:90%
oh, yeah.

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:38.561 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, I should have a minus
sign here because of the--

01:12:38.561 --> 01:12:41.840 align:middle line:90%
it's the k upper index.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's the k upper
index equal to omega.

01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Then k lower index
equal to minus omega.

01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:51.310 align:middle line:90%


01:12:51.310 --> 01:12:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And here, when we
contract with gamma 0,

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:56.030 align:middle line:84%
we use the lower index, so
we have a minus sign here.

01:12:56.030 --> 01:13:00.560 align:middle line:90%


01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.240 align:middle line:84%
So essentially,
this just becomes--

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:04.490 align:middle line:84%
so m can be canceled
on both sides.

01:13:04.490 --> 01:13:08.180 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, it just
becomes the i gamma

01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:16.775 align:middle line:84%
0 u equal to minus u and
i gamma 0 v equal to--

01:13:16.775 --> 01:13:17.275 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:13:17.275 --> 01:13:27.990 align:middle line:90%


01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:30.890 align:middle line:84%
So this just tells you
essentially gamma u--

01:13:30.890 --> 01:13:35.230 align:middle line:84%
u-- it's an
eigenvector of u and v.

01:13:35.230 --> 01:13:37.600 align:middle line:84%
They are just essentially
the eigenvectors of gamma 0.

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:41.500 align:middle line:90%


01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And so let's just now--
to write them explicitly.

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:47.800 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's use the
explicit representation

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.780 align:middle line:90%
of gamma matrices.

01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:51.940 align:middle line:90%
Let me just copy this.

01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:58.210 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's use this
representation with the gamma 0

01:13:58.210 --> 01:14:02.920 align:middle line:90%
is equal to i0 0i minus i.

01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:09.385 align:middle line:84%
And then gamma i is equal to
0i sigma i minus i sigma i0.

01:14:09.385 --> 01:14:13.460 align:middle line:90%


01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And then now, if you
plug in this gamma 0

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:20.820 align:middle line:84%
into those equations,
and then you

01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:23.790 align:middle line:84%
find the equation for u
and v becomes very simple.

01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:31.280 align:middle line:84%
For the u, it just becomes
0, 0, 0, 1 u equal to 0.

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:34.760 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is 2 by 2
blocks because this here

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.410 align:middle line:90%
is 2 by 2 blocks.

01:14:36.410 --> 01:14:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And for v, just the
1, 0, 0 v equal to 0.

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:53.410 align:middle line:84%
So that means u-- you can
just take it to be the upper--

01:14:53.410 --> 01:14:55.780 align:middle line:84%
so that means the solution
of this equation--

01:14:55.780 --> 01:15:05.820 align:middle line:90%


01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:09.090 align:middle line:84%
so that means that the solution
of this equation for u--

01:15:09.090 --> 01:15:11.570 align:middle line:84%
so now let me write
the upper index

01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:15.750 align:middle line:84%
0 means that this is
for the 0 momentum.

01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So here, we can just
choose to pick psi 0.

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:23.610 align:middle line:84%
So psi is some
arbitrary two vector.

01:15:23.610 --> 01:15:31.320 align:middle line:84%
For v, we can just
choose the lower 0 eta.

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:40.280 align:middle line:84%
So psi eta are
arbitrary two vectors--

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:43.285 align:middle line:84%
two complex vectors--
two vector--

01:15:43.285 --> 01:15:46.310 align:middle line:90%


01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:52.070 align:middle line:84%
two component vectors-- two
component complex vectors.

01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:57.650 align:middle line:90%


01:15:57.650 --> 01:16:02.180 align:middle line:84%
So once you have u0 and v0,
and we can choose a basis.

01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:08.351 align:middle line:84%
For example, u0 1
equal to 0, 1, --

01:16:08.351 --> 01:16:16.130 align:middle line:84%
1, 0, 0, 0, and u0 2
equal to 0, 1, 0, 0.

01:16:16.130 --> 01:16:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And similarly,
for v0 1 and v0 2.

01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:26.760 align:middle line:84%
So you can choose
to be here 1, and--

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:32.580 align:middle line:90%


01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:34.580 align:middle line:84%
so you can just choose
as a basis-- you can just

01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:38.870 align:middle line:90%
choose [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:40.100 align:middle line:90%
And now, once you have--

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:45.230 align:middle line:90%


01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:55.970 align:middle line:84%
so once you have the vector at
k equal to 0, for general k,

01:16:55.970 --> 01:16:58.170 align:middle line:90%
what do you do?

01:16:58.170 --> 01:16:58.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:16:58.670 --> 01:16:59.180 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: Lorentz boost.

01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:00.847 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yes, just
do a Lorentz boost.

01:17:00.847 --> 01:17:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So we know the matrix
S. And then you just--

01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:15.560 align:middle line:84%
for the general k, you
just S u0 and vk Sv 0.

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And then you can find
the behavior general k.

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:25.296 align:middle line:84%
But this is-- but this
is easily said than do.

01:17:25.296 --> 01:17:28.720 align:middle line:84%
To do this actually
is not quite easy.

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Even though this sounds
like a great idea--

01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:36.820 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's find the 0 momentum
and then let's just do a boost.

01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:39.340 align:middle line:84%
But this step is still
a little bit tedious.

01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:43.540 align:middle line:84%
But still it's doable
and a little bit simpler

01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:47.980 align:middle line:84%
than solve the original
equation by brute force.

01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:52.960 align:middle line:84%
But there's, again, still
another simpler methods,

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:55.000 align:middle line:84%
which you can actually
just guess the answer.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.040 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
do any calculations.

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.680 align:middle line:90%
You can just guess the answer--

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:02.980 align:middle line:84%
guess the solution
for the full equation.

01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think we don't have
time to talk about it today,

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.890 align:middle line:84%
and so we will talk
about it next time.

01:18:08.890 --> 01:18:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, so
hopefully, you still

01:18:13.210 --> 01:18:16.750 align:middle line:84%
remember what we talked about
today when we come back.

01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And hope you have a
good spring break.

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:26.000 align:middle line:90%
