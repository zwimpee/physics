00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.610 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: So, last
time, we talked

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.200 align:middle line:84%
about path integral formulation
of quantum mechanics.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.845 align:middle line:84%
So let me just quickly
remind you the main idea.

00:00:21.845 --> 00:00:39.100 align:middle line:90%


00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:49.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, so classically, if we
specify the initial location--

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.420 align:middle line:84%
say, if you add
t prime, x prime,

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and then the final location, t
and x so at time t, you add x,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.700 align:middle line:84%
and then there's a
unique trajectory, OK?

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.310 align:middle line:90%
And there's a unique trajectory.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:13.010 align:middle line:84%
So, quantum mechanically,
you ask a different question.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.560 align:middle line:84%
You ask, what is the
transition amplitude

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.600 align:middle line:84%
if you say, at t prime,
you add location x prime?

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And what's the transition
amplitude at time

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.875 align:middle line:90%
t you add the location x?

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:30.542 align:middle line:90%


00:01:30.542 --> 00:01:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And then the answer for this
question, now, is equal to--

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:84%
you just sum of all possible
paths between t prime and x

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.580 align:middle line:90%
prime and t x, OK?

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.460 align:middle line:84%
So you just sum of
all possible paths.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.220 align:middle line:90%
And we sum weights, OK?

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.460 align:middle line:84%
So, more explicitly--
and with the weight,

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.190 align:middle line:90%
you sum of all paths.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And the weight is given
by exponential i h S.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So, for each path,
you have an action.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And then you just evaluate,
for each path, the action.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And then, here, also,
the explicit h bar

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.620 align:middle line:84%
here and because the action
has the unit of h bar.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this would be the
quantum mechanical answer, OK?

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.580 align:middle line:84%
So this is a formulation
of quantum mechanics

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:90%
using path integral.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And so we can write
this more explicitly,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.290 align:middle line:84%
mathematical notation for
the summing over paths

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.650 align:middle line:90%
is the following.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.930 align:middle line:84%
So we introduce a notation like
this, which you integrate over

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.087 align:middle line:84%
all possible
trajectories between x

00:02:57.087 --> 00:03:02.270 align:middle line:90%
t prime equal to x and x t--

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.075 align:middle line:90%
x prime and x t equal to x.

00:03:05.075 --> 00:03:08.170 align:middle line:90%


00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And then you--
with weight S x t.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.400 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And the x t is a
function of x t which you

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.990 align:middle line:90%
integrate from t prime to t.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.940 align:middle line:90%
You have t double prime.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.660 align:middle line:84%
So 1/2 m x dot
squared minus V x, OK?

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.630 align:middle line:84%
So this is for the
one-dimensional particle.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.040 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And, also, this-- so all the
trajectories-- this fixed

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.700 align:middle line:84%
endpoint at t prime should be
equal to x prime, and the time

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.130 align:middle line:90%
t should be equal to x.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And, also, this integration is
a shorthand notation for limit.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.930 align:middle line:84%
So this DX(t)
should be understood

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:13.950 align:middle line:84%
as a limit, when you take
angle to infinity, this factor,

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.450 align:middle line:90%
and divide it by 2 pi i delta t.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:84%
So, essentially, you divide your
paths by intervals of delta t.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.605 align:middle line:84%
And then you integrate
over all possible.

00:04:28.605 --> 00:04:33.430 align:middle line:90%


00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.740 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you separate
the paths from t,

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:45.090 align:middle line:90%
t prime to t by n segments.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.840 align:middle line:90%
So this is the t i.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And then the
location will be x i.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.940 align:middle line:84%
So this is t i, and location--
and then you integrate

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.090 align:middle line:90%
the x i over that, OK?

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is the formulation
of path integral

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.990 align:middle line:90%
for quantum mechanics.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.960 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.035 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:05:10.035 --> 00:05:10.900 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Can you
do this computation

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.817 align:middle line:84%
in some arbitrary basis
that's not necessarily

00:05:12.817 --> 00:05:13.533 align:middle line:90%
a position basis?

00:05:13.533 --> 00:05:14.200 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, in principle, you can
also do this in momentum basis--

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.810 align:middle line:90%
yeah, momentum space.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And, also, you can
actually also generalize--

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.160 align:middle line:90%


00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.700 align:middle line:84%
yeah, we will talk about how you
generalize this to other basis.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.640 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
fundamental formulation.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And when you write
it in other basis,

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:84%
essentially, you
reduce it to this basis

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:49.540 align:middle line:84%
because this is the most
intuitive way to formulate it.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.710 align:middle line:90%
Any other questions?

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.740 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.750 align:middle line:84%
So a simple example is
just a free particle.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.670 align:middle line:90%


00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:12.020 align:middle line:84%
When you have a free
particle, then the S

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.710 align:middle line:90%
is particularly simple.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:21.400 align:middle line:84%
You just-- integration
of 1/2 m x squared, OK?

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.360 align:middle line:84%
So we described that
when S is equal to this--

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and then this is like a
Gaussian integral, OK?

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
quadratic in x, so this

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.630 align:middle line:90%
is like a Gaussian integral.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.640 align:middle line:90%
And so you can reduce--

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.875 align:middle line:84%
so, in this case, you
have a Gaussian integral.

00:06:38.875 --> 00:06:44.800 align:middle line:90%


00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Then, schematically, you
have something like this.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:07:00.980 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:07.710 align:middle line:84%
You can-- when x
is of this form,

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:84%
you can write it in
this general form.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.810 align:middle line:84%
You can write the path
integral in this general form.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And the k, in this case,
will be some delta function.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I wrote down k
last time explicitly,

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.250 align:middle line:84%
and then this is like
a Gaussian integral.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:29.920 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And in the Gaussian integral,
we can just directly write down

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:39.640 align:middle line:84%
its answer under some
constant divided by det of k.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.870 align:middle line:84%
So this determinant is defined
in the spatial functions

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.850 align:middle line:90%
and C is some constant.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:46.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:53.430 align:middle line:84%
So you may also view
this just as a lateral--

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.995 align:middle line:84%
this also just follow from
this continuum limit, OK?

00:07:55.995 --> 00:07:58.290 align:middle line:84%
It follows from this
discrete case, which

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.330 align:middle line:90%
you take a continuum limit.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:00.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.120 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So when you evaluate
that Gaussian integral,

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.670 align:middle line:84%
there's an i in front
in the exponent.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:06.570 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.773 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: How does
this converge?

00:08:08.773 --> 00:08:09.690 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.600 align:middle line:84%
This is the same as you do
the standard Gaussian integral

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.710 align:middle line:90%
with the i.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that integral,
you can also do.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.290 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: But shouldn't
this diverge if it's just--

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.170 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: No, it's a--

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.800 align:middle line:90%
yeah, just with a single--

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:31.630 align:middle line:84%
so this integral, we
can define, right?

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.179 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this integral-- we
know how to do this integral.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:36.120 align:middle line:90%
It's the same as this one.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:36.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.760 align:middle line:90%


00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.550 align:middle line:84%
So you have to do a little
bit mathematical trick

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.650 align:middle line:90%
to do this integral.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.232 align:middle line:90%
But this integral is defined.

00:08:48.232 --> 00:08:49.065 align:middle line:90%
We can give a value.

00:08:49.065 --> 00:08:53.190 align:middle line:90%


00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:54.150 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:59.920 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.700 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:08.380 align:middle line:84%
So this is the path integral
for quantum mechanics

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.000 align:middle line:90%
with one degree of freedom.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.100 align:middle line:84%
So, now, we can just
immediately generalize this

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.620 align:middle line:90%
to more degrees of freedom, OK?

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
really change.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.240 align:middle line:84%
When you have more than
one degree of freedom,

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.650 align:middle line:90%
you just integrate over--

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.480 align:middle line:84%
say, if you have,
say, three particles,

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.180 align:middle line:84%
then you just integrate
the D X 1, dx2,

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.660 align:middle line:84%
D X 3 and then use
the same action, OK?

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's just
straightforward, generalize.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:42.196 align:middle line:84%
And then we can
generalize to field theory

00:09:42.196 --> 00:09:44.571 align:middle line:84%
because field theory, we just
take the numbers of degrees

00:09:44.571 --> 00:09:47.780 align:middle line:90%
of freedom to infinity, OK?

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:48.815 align:middle line:90%
So, we can now--

00:09:48.815 --> 00:09:54.230 align:middle line:90%


00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.730 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.280 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.375 align:middle line:84%
Let me just-- so
to field theory--

00:10:01.375 --> 00:10:15.900 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:21.080 align:middle line:84%
So, in this case, we
just need to replace

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.540 align:middle line:90%
in the different places by--

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.660 align:middle line:84%
so, remember, so the
dynamical variable

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:90%
for a single particle--

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.800 align:middle line:90%
you have this operator.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And then when you go to field
theory, the counterpart of this

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:45.700 align:middle line:84%
is the phi, is your
field variable.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:90%
And then-- so this quantity--

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.770 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:56.780 align:middle line:84%
when you go to field theory,
the corresponding quantity

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:03.860 align:middle line:90%
is phi x at some t and phi x--

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:11.525 align:middle line:84%
say, phi prime x
at time t prime.

00:11:11.525 --> 00:11:12.025 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:12.025 --> 00:11:17.460 align:middle line:90%


00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Again, the way to
think about this

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.080 align:middle line:84%
is just you should
view this x as label.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And then this is just as
if we have infinite number

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.490 align:middle line:90%
of positions, OK?

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.830 align:middle line:84%
You just have infinite
number of phi's, which

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.550 align:middle line:84%
are eigenvalues of this
operator at time t, at t prime,

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.095 align:middle line:90%
and, similarly, here, OK?

00:11:37.095 --> 00:11:41.280 align:middle line:90%


00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.980 align:middle line:84%
So, again, this one--
you can write it

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:48.390 align:middle line:84%
in the form in terms
of the position

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.610 align:middle line:84%
eigenstate-- so
this is the position

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:51.855 align:middle line:90%
eigenstate in field theory.

00:11:51.855 --> 00:12:01.160 align:middle line:90%


00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.710 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is the position
of eigenstate in field theory.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And then we can use
the same technique

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.310 align:middle line:90%
we discussed last time.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:11.540 align:middle line:84%
You just split this into many,
many infinitesimal pieces

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.420 align:middle line:84%
by splitting the time
interval from t prime

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:18.050 align:middle line:84%
to t and split into
many pieces and then

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.080 align:middle line:84%
just do it over and over and
insert a complete set of state

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle line:90%
of phi, OK?

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.160 align:middle line:90%
And, now, you just--

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:34.250 align:middle line:84%
so H is now, of course, is
the field counterpart of it

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.535 align:middle line:90%
because H--

00:12:35.535 --> 00:12:36.160 align:middle line:90%
you could, too.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.080 align:middle line:84%
But the details of
this does not matter.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:46.090 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Say, this is the Hamiltonian.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.340 align:middle line:84%
You can just insert
this into here,

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.710 align:middle line:84%
and then you just repeat
the same procedure, OK?

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Just keep in mind, now, you
just have infinite number

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.840 align:middle line:90%
of degrees of freedom, OK?

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.160 align:middle line:90%
That's the only difference.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Your rotation becomes a
little bit more complicated.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:07.110 align:middle line:84%
But if you keep a
very clear mind,

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:11.340 align:middle line:84%
with the correspondence with
the single particle case,

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.100 align:middle line:90%
then everything is the same, OK?

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.670 align:middle line:84%
If you understand how to
translate the rotation here

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.410 align:middle line:84%
to the rotation
here, then everything

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.180 align:middle line:90%
is just exactly the same, OK?

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Just everything goes through.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:27.220 align:middle line:84%
So I will not repeat
that procedure.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And, now, you just
find this quantity.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Then, again, we can write this
in terms of path integral.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:36.750 align:middle line:84%
So, now, this can be
written as in terms

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:37.830 align:middle line:90%
of path integral of phi.

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, you integrate over all
possible configurations of phi

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.580 align:middle line:84%
with is the boundary
condition phi

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:53.640 align:middle line:90%
t prime x equal to phi prime x.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.210 align:middle line:90%
And the phi t x--

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:90%
equal to phi x.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And, again, you just
have exponential i S phi.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.000 align:middle line:90%
And S is the action for phi.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.305 align:middle line:90%
So, now, the S--

00:14:12.305 --> 00:14:19.730 align:middle line:90%


00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:27.920 align:middle line:90%
is now-- so, in this case--

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.110 align:middle line:84%
yeah, it's an integration
of the Lagrangian density.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:34.310 align:middle line:90%
And L is 1/2.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:36.755 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's just what
we wrote down before.

00:14:36.755 --> 00:14:45.720 align:middle line:90%


00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.910 align:middle line:90%
OK, some potential phi--

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:47.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:49.870 align:middle line:90%


00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:54.060 align:middle line:84%
So for any scalar field theory,
these just work identically,

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:54.560 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And, again, you just
get the integration

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.720 align:middle line:84%
over the Lagrangian,
which is become

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.080 align:middle line:84%
four integral of the
Lagrangian density, OK?

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.100 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:16.480 align:middle line:90%


00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.390 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:27.680 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you get confused
about path integral in field

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:34.430 align:middle line:84%
theory, then try to
translate into the language

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:39.050 align:middle line:84%
of a single particle by doing
this kind of replacement.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you will be able
to settle your problem.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And then whenever you get
confused about the path

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.580 align:middle line:84%
integral in this
quantum mechanics,

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:53.690 align:middle line:84%
then just reduce it by a
finite dimensional integral,

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:56.480 align:middle line:84%
and then you should be
able to understand, OK?

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Just always reduce it
to the simple case.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And, often, your confusion
can be understood

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.730 align:middle line:90%
in that simpler case, OK?

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:06.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:11.070 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:11.680 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.630 align:middle line:84%
So, now, let me explain a little
bit what this notation means,

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:17.200 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So this said in words
means you integrate over

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:27.640 align:middle line:84%
all possible configurations
of phi between t and t prime.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And the final configuration--
the initial configuration to be

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:37.187 align:middle line:84%
phi prime, and the final
configuration to be phi--

00:16:37.187 --> 00:16:38.380 align:middle line:90%
phi x--

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:42.340 align:middle line:84%
and the initial to
be phi prime x, OK?

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.895 align:middle line:84%
So let me just say,
previously, DX(t)--

00:16:44.895 --> 00:16:48.090 align:middle line:90%


00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:51.450 align:middle line:84%
if you think about it in terms
of discrete case corresponding

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:52.740 align:middle line:90%
to-- you just sum--

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:59.310 align:middle line:84%
take the product of all the o
at different time d x i, OK?

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:02.460 align:middle line:84%
So in the continuum
limit, it's like you just

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.130 align:middle line:84%
take the product of
all possible value of t

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:08.280 align:middle line:84%
and then integrate
over the value of x

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.669 align:middle line:90%
at that particular value of t.

00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:84%
So that's the meaning
of this DX(t),

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:18.490 align:middle line:84%
which is up to a prefactor
corresponding to that.

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:25.710 align:middle line:84%
So, similarly, phi
is the same thing.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:30.560 align:middle line:84%
So, now, remember, phi x has now
become the dynamical variable.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.100 align:middle line:90%
So this now becomes sum over--

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.545 align:middle line:90%
take product over t.

00:17:36.545 --> 00:17:40.510 align:middle line:90%


00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:41.010 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:41.740 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:46.080 align:middle line:84%
First, you think of
take product over x.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.600 align:middle line:90%
So this is a label of x.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.150 align:middle line:84%
So x are the labels
of phi, and you

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.130 align:middle line:90%
take all possible value of x.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And then each of
them is just like a--

00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:00.090 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:00.870 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:06.510 align:middle line:84%
So just like you have so
many different variables,

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:10.530 align:middle line:84%
each x label one
degree of freedom, OK?

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:11.940 align:middle line:90%
And then you have phi t.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.150 align:middle line:90%
And, now, then you use this one.

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:20.520 align:middle line:90%
Then you have t x d phi.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:26.400 align:middle line:90%


00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Is it clear what
this equation means?

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:34.940 align:middle line:90%


00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So this step tells
you that you have

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.240 align:middle line:84%
many, many different
degrees of freedom.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So this step is just enumerate
all possible degrees of freedom

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.627 align:middle line:90%
which are labeled by x.

00:18:47.627 --> 00:18:49.210 align:middle line:84%
It's just like your
standard integral.

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:52.660 align:middle line:84%
If you have five-dimensional
integral, and each--

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.930 align:middle line:84%
and then you just have a product
of five different variables,

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:56.650 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Here, we have all different
possible value of x variables.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And that variable
is a function of t.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And then, now, we
use this equation.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And each of them
is like here, OK?

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And then, now, you
have the product

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.560 align:middle line:90%
of all possible value of t.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And then you integrate, then,
all possible values of phi,

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.340 align:middle line:90%
say, at point x and t, OK?

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:26.970 align:middle line:84%
But, remember, t always is
between t prime and t, OK?

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:27.873 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:19:27.873 --> 00:19:30.290 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: If I'm understanding
your notation for the first

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:84%
equation, the second equality--
what is plugging in--

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.540 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: You mean here?

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:36.705 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: The one above it.

00:19:36.705 --> 00:19:37.580 align:middle line:90%
No, the one above it.

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:38.120 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.537 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So that
second quality--

00:19:39.537 --> 00:19:41.373 align:middle line:84%
so when you relabel
i to the t, that's--

00:19:41.373 --> 00:19:42.290 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, here, I just write
it in the continuum form.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:48.170 align:middle line:90%
So, here, I labeled it by t i.

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:53.340 align:middle line:84%
So each location t i, I
have d x i in that form.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.700 align:middle line:84%
But if I go to continuum limit
and go to infinite limit,

00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:01.970 align:middle line:84%
essentially, at each point
t, I have integration of x.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And so that's roughly the
continuum form of that.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.325 align:middle line:90%
And, here, it's similar.

00:20:10.325 --> 00:20:13.230 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.930 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.300 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.550 align:middle line:84%
So once you have
learned this trick,

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.890 align:middle line:84%
do the reduction,
and I think you

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:23.690 align:middle line:84%
will be able to settle
all your confusions

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.460 align:middle line:90%
about these definitions, OK?

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.880 align:middle line:90%


00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:33.260 align:middle line:90%


00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:39.365 align:middle line:84%
So, other than that, other
than this additional label x--

00:20:39.365 --> 00:20:50.390 align:middle line:90%
so other than additional label--

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:55.010 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:56.990 align:middle line:90%
I should call it here label x.

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:11.440 align:middle line:84%
So the field theory path
integral for a scalar field

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:24.320 align:middle line:84%
is essentially identical to
that in quantum mechanics, OK?

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:28.630 align:middle line:90%


00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:30.100 align:middle line:90%
So just to emphasize this point.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:34.080 align:middle line:90%


00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So, here, actually, you
can define this general.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:38.420 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what your V is, OK?

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.210 align:middle line:84%
You can choose
whatever V you want.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:43.790 align:middle line:90%
The story does not change.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:47.430 align:middle line:84%
Just like when we do the
single particle case,

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.580 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter
what this V is, OK?

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:52.350 align:middle line:84%
You can choose arbitrary
V, if you want.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:55.010 align:middle line:90%
But if we choose V to be--

00:21:55.010 --> 00:22:03.270 align:middle line:84%
when v is for the
free theory, then--

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.940 align:middle line:84%
in this case, of course,
a particularly simple.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:23.127 align:middle line:84%
And then, in this case, the path
integral is again Gaussian, OK?

00:22:23.127 --> 00:22:24.710 align:middle line:84%
The path integral
is, again, Gaussian.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.810 align:middle line:90%
I will not write it again.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:28.070 align:middle line:90%
So, again, that formula--

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:33.290 align:middle line:84%
and this formula
applies just this case,

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:35.180 align:middle line:90%
in a more complicated space.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:38.030 align:middle line:84%
K is the operator in a
more complicated space, OK?

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:40.640 align:middle line:84%
So, now, you not only
have the space of t,

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.950 align:middle line:84%
but you also have
the space of x.

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:46.880 align:middle line:84%
But once you generalize to
some space of functions,

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:47.630 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:49.670 align:middle line:84%
This function becomes
more complicated, OK?

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.698 align:middle line:84%
And so, conceptually,
they're the same.

00:22:52.698 --> 00:22:53.990 align:middle line:90%
Conceptually, they're the same.

00:22:53.990 --> 00:23:02.510 align:middle line:90%


00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:04.160 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:10.090 align:middle line:84%
So, now, for interacting
theory, then, essentially, then

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.290 align:middle line:84%
the quantum field
theory then reduce

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:15.170 align:middle line:90%
to doing this path integral, OK?

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.090 align:middle line:84%
If you know how to do
this path integral,

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and then, essentially, you know
how to solve the theory, OK?

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:24.540 align:middle line:84%
You know how to
solve the theory.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And so, as I said, in
the free theory case,

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.450 align:middle line:84%
it's essentially reduced
to a Gaussian integral.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Then everything
is simple, and we

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:37.230 align:middle line:84%
will go back to discuss that in
a little bit more detail later.

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And, now, let's just
think a little bit

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:46.470 align:middle line:84%
how to treat the
interacting case.

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:57.440 align:middle line:84%
So, recall, our goal is
to compute this object--

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.530 align:middle line:84%
the vacuum expectation value
of time-ordered correlation

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:06.180 align:middle line:90%
functions, OK?

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.840 align:middle line:84%
We want to compute
this object, OK?

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.150 align:middle line:84%
So, now, we will discuss
how we use path integral

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:13.950 align:middle line:90%
to compute this object, OK?

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:17.170 align:middle line:90%


00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:22.495 align:middle line:84%
So before doing that, let's
first try to do this in--

00:24:22.495 --> 00:24:25.980 align:middle line:90%


00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:29.010 align:middle line:84%
so before doing
that, let's first

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:32.820 align:middle line:84%
discuss how to do this
in quantum mechanics,

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.480 align:middle line:84%
before doing this
in field theory.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And we can just
first understand how

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:40.020 align:middle line:84%
we compute the similar
object in quantum mechanics.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.942 align:middle line:84%
And once we understand
how to do that,

00:24:41.942 --> 00:24:43.650 align:middle line:84%
again, the generalization
to field theory

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:45.780 align:middle line:90%
will be straightforward.

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:49.550 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So, first, we talk about
time-ordered correlation

00:24:56.860 --> 00:25:07.770 align:middle line:84%
function in quantum
mechanics, OK?

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:12.240 align:middle line:84%
So we will be introducing
a number of tricks,

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and those tricks will then
take over to field theory, OK?

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:20.910 align:middle line:84%
They will be carried
over to field theory.

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:25.130 align:middle line:84%
So, again, let's just
consider this system, OK?

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Let's consider a
system like this--

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:31.780 align:middle line:84%
just with the Lagrangian of this
form, just one particle theory,

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:32.710 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And then the analog of this
object is this object--

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:42.010 align:middle line:90%
let's call it G n--

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:47.680 align:middle line:84%
would be, say-- so let's
call the 0 is the vacuum

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.120 align:middle line:90%
of the field theory--

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.890 align:middle line:84%
of this quantum
mechanical system.

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
time-ordered, and then you

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:84%
have x t 1 because the dynamical
variable here for quantum

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:05.650 align:middle line:84%
mechanics is just x and x t
n at different time and then

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:06.520 align:middle line:90%
here, OK?

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:11.920 align:middle line:84%
So we want to compute such
object in quantum mechanics.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:90%


00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.720 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.260 align:middle line:84%
So our goal is to develop
techniques-- yeah,

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:26.200 align:middle line:84%
so you should imagine all
these are operators, OK?

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.150 align:middle line:90%
All these are operators.

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:32.485 align:middle line:84%
So our goal is to develop
techniques to calculate this.

00:26:32.485 --> 00:26:37.250 align:middle line:90%


00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:44.240 align:middle line:84%
OK, so before doing
that, let's first

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:49.970 align:middle line:84%
understand how to do
this time-ordering using

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:51.350 align:middle line:90%
path integral, OK?

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:54.300 align:middle line:90%


00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.850 align:middle line:84%
So before I do that, do
you have any questions?

00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:03.555 align:middle line:90%


00:27:03.555 --> 00:27:04.055 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:04.055 --> 00:27:08.550 align:middle line:90%


00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:13.710 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out,
actually, path integral

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:18.513 align:middle line:84%
is some of the natural,
the most natural objects

00:27:18.513 --> 00:27:20.680 align:middle line:84%
to think about such kind
of time-ordered correlation

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.390 align:middle line:90%
functions, OK?

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And we will see, in a
minute, the path integral

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:28.450 align:middle line:84%
is actually the most
natural thing to--

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:30.130 align:middle line:84%
the most natural
framework to think

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:32.960 align:middle line:84%
about this kind of time-ordered
correlation functions.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:37.120 align:middle line:84%
So before doing that, let's
consider one simple example.

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:47.100 align:middle line:84%
So, firstly, consider-- so let's
consider some other time, t 1,

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.190 align:middle line:90%
between t prime and t, OK?

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:53.835 align:middle line:84%
So we consider again, we go
back to this problem, OK?

00:27:53.835 --> 00:27:54.960 align:middle line:90%
We go back to this problem.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.680 align:middle line:84%
But we can see there's some time
in between t prime and t, OK?

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.200 align:middle line:84%
So, now, let's
consider this object.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.200 align:middle line:84%
So the simplest
case of this one--

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.670 align:middle line:90%
you just take n equal to 1, OK?

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:08.050 align:middle line:90%
You just have one of them.

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:11.420 align:middle line:90%


00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:12.795 align:middle line:84%
Let's consider
the simplest case.

00:28:12.795 --> 00:28:21.180 align:middle line:90%


00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.310 align:middle line:90%
So let's consider this object.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:27.190 align:middle line:90%
So this is easy to do.

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:30.880 align:middle line:84%
We can just use the same
technique we used before.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:39.270 align:middle line:84%
So, essentially, most of the
tricks in quantum mechanics

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:42.480 align:middle line:90%
just reduce to one trick.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I say most
of the case, OK?

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Most of the case, tricks
in quantum mechanics

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:49.500 align:middle line:90%
reduce to one trick.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:53.740 align:middle line:84%
What is that trick, which we
already used over and over,

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.295 align:middle line:84%
say, in driving
the path integral?

00:28:56.295 --> 00:28:57.170 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Identities?

00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.400 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
insert identities.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you know how
to insert identities

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.310 align:middle line:84%
at the right location
at the right time,

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:08.600 align:middle line:90%
and, essentially, you can--

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:12.570 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you know all the
tricks in quantum mechanics.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And so, here, we
do the same thing.

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:18.650 align:middle line:84%
So since this, at
t 1, so we just

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:22.760 align:middle line:84%
insert the complete set of
position eigenstate at t 1.

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:26.400 align:middle line:90%
So let's just do this.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So we integrate x 1, t 1 and the
x 1, t 1, x hat, t 1, x prime,

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:47.090 align:middle line:90%
t prime, OK?

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:49.600 align:middle line:90%


00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.220 align:middle line:90%
So these are the--

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.930 align:middle line:90%
so this integrates to 1, OK?

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:57.470 align:middle line:90%
This integrates to 1.

00:29:57.470 --> 00:30:04.820 align:middle line:84%
So since this is eigenstate at
t1, so this act on this will--

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.640 align:middle line:90%
you just get your eigenvalue.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:13.040 align:middle line:90%
So we just get d x1, x1.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.850 align:middle line:90%
So you just get eigenvalue.

00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:25.435 align:middle line:84%
And then you had xt, x1 t1,
x1 t1, x prime, t prime, OK?

00:30:25.435 --> 00:30:30.130 align:middle line:90%


00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:34.260 align:middle line:84%
But, now, we know how
to do both of them.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.710 align:middle line:84%
We just plug in our
path integral formula

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:41.740 align:middle line:90%
to both of them, OK?

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:45.870 align:middle line:90%


00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:47.450 align:middle line:90%
So you can do this explicitly--

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:51.880 align:middle line:90%


00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:57.040 align:middle line:84%
plug in in this
expression there, OK?

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.375 align:middle line:90%
Plug in this expression there.

00:30:58.375 --> 00:31:01.250 align:middle line:90%


00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:02.780 align:middle line:90%
But it's also very intuitive.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:06.720 align:middle line:84%
You know what this
looks like, OK?

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.370 align:middle line:90%
So this is like the following.

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So, previously, we just do all
the paths between these two,

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:16.320 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:22.780 align:middle line:90%
So, now, we are--

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:27.880 align:middle line:84%
now you have this x
t, and now we have t1.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.400 align:middle line:90%
So suppose this is the time, t1.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And suppose t goes up,
and so this is t prime.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.930 align:middle line:90%


00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:40.190 align:middle line:84%
So suppose this is the time
t1, and this is t at prime, x

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:42.930 align:middle line:90%
prime, OK?

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:45.046 align:middle line:90%
So this corresponding to you--

00:31:45.046 --> 00:31:49.140 align:middle line:84%
you first do the path
integral to some location t1--

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.900 align:middle line:90%
integrate over all paths here.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And then you multiply
x1, and then you

00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:00.140 align:middle line:84%
do all the path
integral here, OK?

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And then you
iterate over x1, OK?

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:07.660 align:middle line:90%
You integrate x1, OK?

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:11.090 align:middle line:84%
So, now, if you--
without this x1--

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:13.290 align:middle line:84%
if we are without
x1, then, of course,

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:16.370 align:middle line:84%
this is trivially equal
to the previous one

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:20.150 align:middle line:84%
because you do all
possible paths to t1

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:22.190 align:middle line:84%
and all possible
paths from t1 to t,

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and then you iterate over
all possible location here.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Then it's the same as you
integrate from here to there--

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.420 align:middle line:90%
the arbitrary path, OK?

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:34.310 align:middle line:84%
So the only difference
is, now, we multiply by x1

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:37.130 align:middle line:90%
and the value at t1.

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And, now, we can
immediately write down,

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:40.920 align:middle line:84%
using path integral,
what is this object?

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.760 align:middle line:90%
So this object is, essentially--

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.310 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's just equal to--

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:51.205 align:middle line:84%
so, now, I will use
a simplified notation

00:32:51.205 --> 00:33:01.120 align:middle line:84%
and say, here, write x prime, t
prime, x t to be the limit, OK?

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And then, again, we
integrate all possible paths

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:04.540 align:middle line:90%
between them.

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:07.300 align:middle line:90%


00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:11.545 align:middle line:84%
But, then, we just
have x t1 here.

00:33:11.545 --> 00:33:16.580 align:middle line:90%


00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:19.370 align:middle line:84%
You integrate over all
possible paths between them.

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:21.350 align:middle line:90%
Just add, this time, t1.

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:25.190 align:middle line:84%
You multiply in the integrand
the value of x at t1.

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this is essentially
just the x1 here, OK?

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:32.540 align:middle line:90%
Is this clear?

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:35.930 align:middle line:84%
You can do this explicitly
by plugging in those formulas

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:37.010 align:middle line:90%
and then manipulating.

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:38.270 align:middle line:90%
You will get this.

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:44.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's much easier to
understand it heuristically

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.985 align:middle line:90%
using a diagram.

00:33:44.985 --> 00:33:50.700 align:middle line:90%


00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.880 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:58.200 align:middle line:84%
So this is very,
very suggestive.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:04.020 align:middle line:84%
It tells you, when we
insert an operator here,

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:07.320 align:middle line:84%
what we do is just we
translate the eigenvalue

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:11.969 align:middle line:84%
of this operator, plug
it in the integrand.

00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:16.409 align:middle line:90%


00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:19.409 align:middle line:84%
So, now, you can
do the same thing.

00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you have
two operators, OK?

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:28.400 align:middle line:90%
So, now, let's look at--

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.750 align:middle line:90%
you have two operators.

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:36.865 align:middle line:90%


00:34:36.865 --> 00:34:37.365 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:37.365 --> 00:34:45.000 align:middle line:90%


00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.989 align:middle line:84%
So you can almost
immediately write down--

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:52.080 align:middle line:84%
if you try to generalize
that, what would you

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:56.420 align:middle line:90%
write down this, the answer?

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.139 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:34:57.139 --> 00:35:00.920 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: State the x and t1
and the x and t2 as an integral.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.600 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.275 align:middle line:90%
So you just--

00:35:03.275 --> 00:35:08.040 align:middle line:90%


00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:08.540 align:middle line:90%
DX(t).

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:19.989 align:middle line:90%


00:35:19.989 --> 00:35:23.880 align:middle line:90%
But this is almost correct--

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:29.590 align:middle line:84%
not completely correct-- for
one reason, which, actually, one

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:30.880 align:middle line:90%
of you asked before.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.120 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Just because
you haven't ordered them.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.050 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:48.400 align:middle line:84%
This is only equal to that only
for when t1 is greater than t2.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.460 align:middle line:84%
So, remember, all
these paths-- they

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.650 align:middle line:90%
don't come back in time, OK?

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:55.150 align:middle line:84%
The paths-- they
go forward in time.

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:58.390 align:middle line:90%
They don't come back.

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:03.100 align:middle line:84%
So, here, it's like you
have to insert the two--

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.650 align:middle line:84%
here, you just insert the
two sets of complete states.

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:06.530 align:middle line:90%
One is here.

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:07.540 align:middle line:90%
One is here.

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:10.040 align:middle line:84%
But the path integral
cannot come back, OK?

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:10.540 align:middle line:90%
So

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.090 align:middle line:84%
The order here have to be
the same as the ordering

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:15.690 align:middle line:90%
of the path integral, OK?

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:18.150 align:middle line:84%
It has to be the same
ordering of the path integral.

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:26.035 align:middle line:84%
So that means this is equal
only for t1 greater than t2, OK?

00:36:26.035 --> 00:36:31.140 align:middle line:90%


00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:40.750 align:middle line:84%
But the same thing happens
but for t2 greater than t1.

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:45.310 align:middle line:84%
So suppose t2 is
greater than t1.

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:47.470 align:middle line:84%
If you start this
expression, then we can ask,

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:50.282 align:middle line:84%
what the corresponding
operator form?

00:36:50.282 --> 00:36:52.240 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think will
be the operator form?

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:58.780 align:middle line:90%


00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so for t1 greater than t2,
we have this equal to that, OK?

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.660 align:middle line:90%
But, now, let's ask--

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:08.680 align:middle line:84%
suppose it's opposite--
t2 greater than t1.

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.080 align:middle line:84%
But, on the right-hand side,
we still have this one.

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.838 align:middle line:84%
But what should be
the left-hand side?

00:37:13.838 --> 00:37:15.230 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: x t2 and x t1.

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:16.022 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:37:16.022 --> 00:37:19.850 align:middle line:84%
We just exchange x2 and t1
because path integral always

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:21.330 align:middle line:90%
follows the time order.

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So that means the order here
has always to be time-ordered.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.120 align:middle line:84%
So that means that
the correct formula,

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:31.290 align:middle line:90%
which applies for all t1, t2--

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:32.730 align:middle line:90%
it's just you time-order them.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:38.370 align:middle line:90%


00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:39.600 align:middle line:90%
You just time-order them.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:44.320 align:middle line:90%


00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So no matter for what
the value of t1 and t2,

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:52.810 align:middle line:84%
if you time-order them so that
the x which is the larger time

00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:57.810 align:middle line:84%
always sit in the front, then
it's always equal to this one,

00:37:57.810 --> 00:37:58.980 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So this, now, I'll just
immediately generalize, OK?

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:26.170 align:middle line:84%
So this tells you, because of
the path integral-- in the path

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:28.420 align:middle line:84%
integral, the time
only goes forward.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:36.930 align:middle line:90%


00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:40.230 align:middle line:90%
The time only goes forward.

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Then the time ordering naturally
arises in path integrals, OK?

00:38:56.530 --> 00:39:00.430 align:middle line:90%


00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:03.710 align:middle line:84%
So you can immediately
generalize this.

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:04.760 align:middle line:90%
So for any t--

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:08.140 align:middle line:90%


00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:17.690 align:middle line:84%
for any t1, tn
between t prime and t,

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:31.630 align:middle line:84%
then you always have x t
time-ordered, x hat t1, x tn,

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:32.350 align:middle line:90%
0.

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is equal to x prime, t
prime, x t, DX(t), and x t1, x

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:54.210 align:middle line:90%
tn, exponential i S x t, OK?

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:59.200 align:middle line:90%


00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we say, earlier,
that, using path integral,

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.780 align:middle line:84%
our goal is to
compute this object.

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:13.390 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, actually, using
path integral to go compute it

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:17.290 align:middle line:84%
is very natural because the
time-ordering-- it's just

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:20.980 align:middle line:84%
very natural from the point
of view of path integral.

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:21.982 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:40:21.982 --> 00:40:23.458 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't
the x be x' t'?

00:40:23.458 --> 00:40:27.073 align:middle line:90%


00:40:27.073 --> 00:40:28.240 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Oh, sorry, sorry.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:31.680 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:32.180 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:39.100 align:middle line:90%


00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:41.180 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:42.355 align:middle line:90%
So this is a key formula.

00:40:42.355 --> 00:40:45.513 align:middle line:90%


00:40:45.513 --> 00:40:46.805 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this is the key formula.

00:40:46.805 --> 00:40:51.020 align:middle line:90%


00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:51.520 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:55.850 align:middle line:90%


00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:57.267 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:40:57.267 --> 00:40:59.780 align:middle line:90%


00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So, now, we have got
the time-ordering.

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:05.190 align:middle line:90%
OK, now, we want to compute.

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:08.790 align:middle line:84%
But here is the vacuum
correlation function, OK?

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So we have to actually
go to the vacuum.

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Here, it's in such between
the position eigenstate, OK?

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:22.920 align:middle line:84%
So, now, we have to see how
to do this for the vacuum.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:26.670 align:middle line:84%
So, now, let me just introduce
a simplified rotation.

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:30.330 align:middle line:84%
So let me call this
whole thing X--

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:33.590 align:middle line:90%
capital X, OK?

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:38.450 align:middle line:84%
I call this whole
thing capital X.

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:44.670 align:middle line:84%
So, now, so we want to
consider the vacuum correlation

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:45.170 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:54.710 align:middle line:90%


00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:58.455 align:middle line:90%
So the idea is very simple, OK?

00:41:58.455 --> 00:42:19.520 align:middle line:90%


00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:21.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:24.050 align:middle line:84%
So we want to consider
a vacuum function.

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:37.240 align:middle line:84%
We want to interested in
the G n for arbitrary t1,

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:42.400 align:middle line:84%
tn belongs to minus infinity
to plus infinity, OK?

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.950 align:middle line:90%


00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:46.195 align:middle line:90%
So you want to compute this.

00:42:46.195 --> 00:42:52.780 align:middle line:90%


00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:56.140 align:middle line:84%
OK, and the G n,
using our notation,

00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:00.100 align:middle line:90%
we know equal to 0, X, 0, OK?

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:05.950 align:middle line:90%


00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:09.720 align:middle line:90%
So I denote 0 for that.

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:15.340 align:middle line:84%
So now, again, we insert a
complete set of states, OK?

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, we insert a
complete set of states.

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:28.340 align:middle line:84%
We insert 1 equal
to dx, x t, which

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:35.270 align:middle line:84%
is also equal to dx prime,
x prime, t prime, x prime, t

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:37.010 align:middle line:90%
prime, OK?

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:39.820 align:middle line:90%


00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:45.670 align:middle line:84%
This t goes to plus
infinity, and t prime

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:50.040 align:middle line:84%
goes to minus infinity
into here, OK?

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:52.525 align:middle line:90%
So insert that into here.

00:43:52.525 --> 00:43:53.025 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:53.025 --> 00:43:55.550 align:middle line:90%


00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:56.720 align:middle line:90%
And then we find--

00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:00.470 align:middle line:90%


00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:01.550 align:middle line:90%
yeah, so let me--

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:06.060 align:middle line:84%
I need the bigger space, so
let me just write it down.

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:07.040 align:middle line:90%
So if you do that--

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:11.330 align:middle line:90%


00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:12.970 align:middle line:90%
so this trick is general.

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:16.450 align:middle line:84%
It does not restrict
to the vacuum.

00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:19.900 align:middle line:84%
So, in any case,
evaluating any states,

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:24.570 align:middle line:84%
you can reduce it
to the path integral

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:29.990 align:middle line:84%
by doing this trick of
inserting these guys.

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:34.550 align:middle line:84%
So then we have Gn,
now, just equal to--

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:38.450 align:middle line:84%
now we have limit t
goes to plus infinity,

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:41.930 align:middle line:90%
t prime goes to minus infinity.

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:45.020 align:middle line:90%
Then we have dx, dx prime.

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So we insert one here and
the one here, in both places.

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:52.820 align:middle line:90%
Here, we insert the upper line.

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Here, we insert
the lower line, OK?

00:44:55.550 --> 00:45:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Then we have 0, x, t,
then x t, x, x prime,

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:14.045 align:middle line:84%
t prime, and then x
prime, t prime, then 0--

00:45:14.045 --> 00:45:17.150 align:middle line:90%


00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:19.720 align:middle line:90%
times.

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:20.220 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:25.690 align:middle line:90%


00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:32.760 align:middle line:90%
So, now, we just have--

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:36.280 align:middle line:90%
yeah, so let me just save some--

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:41.840 align:middle line:84%
so this then become
dx, dx prime.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.015 align:middle line:90%
So these two are simple.

00:45:43.015 --> 00:45:45.650 align:middle line:90%


00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:49.055 align:middle line:84%
So, essentially, they just
become the vacuum wave

00:45:49.055 --> 00:45:51.330 align:middle line:90%
function, OK?

00:45:51.330 --> 00:46:01.092 align:middle line:84%
So we have psi 0 star
x and psi 0 x prime.

00:46:01.092 --> 00:46:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And then we have this path
integral, which we already

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:06.480 align:middle line:90%
know how to do, OK?

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.847 align:middle line:84%
Then we have this
path integral, OK?

00:46:08.847 --> 00:46:10.180 align:middle line:90%
Then we have that path integral.

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:15.870 align:middle line:90%


00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:18.090 align:middle line:90%
So you just insert--

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:22.080 align:middle line:84%
so when we call star, you
just insert the star here, OK?

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:25.930 align:middle line:90%


00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And, now, with t and
t prime to infinity--

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:33.470 align:middle line:90%


00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:36.260 align:middle line:84%
and, yeah, the reason we take
t prime and t go to infinity

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:39.210 align:middle line:84%
is obvious because
we want to include--

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:42.440 align:middle line:84%
so, here, the t has to go
between the t prime and the t.

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:44.780 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to
have arbitrary t--

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and then we want the t prime
to go to minus infinity

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:53.150 align:middle line:90%
and t go to plus infinity.

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.960 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:46:53.960 --> 00:47:03.110 align:middle line:84%
So we have used that-- the
x prime, t prime 0 is just

00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:08.500 align:middle line:84%
equal to psi 0 x prime, just the
ground state wave function, OK?

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:21.060 align:middle line:90%


00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:22.830 align:middle line:90%
So that means that--

00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:27.870 align:middle line:84%
so this trick actually works
for other states, too, OK?

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:30.390 align:middle line:90%
You can do the similar trick.

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And you just essentially get
two more integrals to do.

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And you take that path
integral, and then

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:42.120 align:middle line:84%
you just integrate it over
the initial and the final wave

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:43.640 align:middle line:90%
functions, OK?

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:47.800 align:middle line:90%


00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.700 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the trick
applies to any state--

00:47:50.700 --> 00:48:03.220 align:middle line:90%


00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.830 align:middle line:84%
can you see-- not just the
vacuum correlation functions.

00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:09.350 align:middle line:90%


00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:09.998 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:48:09.998 --> 00:48:12.290 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So does this still
count as-- because this is

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:14.458 align:middle line:84%
still quantum mechanics
what we're doing,

00:48:14.458 --> 00:48:15.250 align:middle line:90%
your ground state--

00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:18.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is an
energy eigenket,

00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:20.260 align:middle line:90%
and it's the ground state, or--

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:21.140 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:21.640 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:22.270 align:middle line:90%
Say it again.

00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:25.060 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So since this is still
quantum mechanics, I'm saying,

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:27.220 align:middle line:84%
this 0 here is like an
energy eigenket, right?

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:28.177 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:48:28.177 --> 00:48:29.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's a ground state.

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:32.620 align:middle line:84%
It's the it's the
lowest-energy eigenstate, yeah.

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:33.470 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:37.630 align:middle line:84%
You can also take
other states, too.

00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:40.150 align:middle line:84%
It just will be some
wave function there.

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:42.010 align:middle line:84%
It will be some
wave function there.

00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:43.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:45.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:46.970 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]
someone else said,

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:51.420 align:middle line:84%
which evolves in time,
then moves [INAUDIBLE]..

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:52.750 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:53.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, if you not take-- yeah,
that's a very good question.

00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.360 align:middle line:90%
So if you don't take--

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:03.760 align:middle line:84%
and so if you take other states,
and then, in general, there

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.773 align:middle line:84%
may be some
dependence on t prime

00:49:05.773 --> 00:49:06.940 align:middle line:90%
and t in this wave function.

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:10.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, indeed, yeah.

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:14.270 align:middle line:84%
So you have to take the limit,
also, in the wave function.

00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:14.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:17.110 align:middle line:84%
But, here, we are using
the simplification

00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:20.530 align:middle line:84%
that the ground state is
actually time-independent.

00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:21.170 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:24.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's a good question.

00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:26.060 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:28.970 align:middle line:90%


00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:31.580 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So this works,
essentially, for any state.

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:39.740 align:middle line:84%
But for the ground
state, actually, there's

00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:44.420 align:middle line:84%
another trick which can
simplify the problem, which

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:48.950 align:middle line:84%
you don't even have to do this
two additional integral, OK?

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:51.830 align:middle line:90%
You can actually directly--

00:49:51.830 --> 00:50:01.830 align:middle line:84%
so, for the ground
state, for the vacuum,

00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:09.775 align:middle line:84%
there's actually another
trick to get rid of--

00:50:09.775 --> 00:50:15.560 align:middle line:90%


00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:22.960 align:middle line:84%
to make the-- these two
additional integrals

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:30.840 align:middle line:90%
unnecessary, OK?

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:33.355 align:middle line:84%
So, now, let me tell you
how you do this trick.

00:50:33.355 --> 00:50:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And this trick is
very important, also,

00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:37.980 align:middle line:84%
in quantum field
theory because, if you

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:40.185 align:middle line:84%
do a harmonic
oscillator, of course,

00:50:40.185 --> 00:50:42.990 align:middle line:90%
you know the wave function.

00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:45.660 align:middle line:84%
But if I give you a
aharmonic oscillator, which

00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:49.140 align:middle line:84%
we don't know how to solve the
ground state wave function,

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:52.445 align:middle line:84%
and then this will be a
nightmare because then

00:50:52.445 --> 00:50:53.820 align:middle line:84%
you don't know
the wave function.

00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:56.445 align:middle line:84%
And for quantum field theory, in
particular, in the interacting

00:50:56.445 --> 00:51:00.510 align:middle line:84%
case, we don't know
the wave function, OK?

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:03.390 align:middle line:84%
So even though this formally
gives you the answer,

00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:07.000 align:middle line:84%
but, in practice, it's actually
often not convenient to use,

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:07.500 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:09.330 align:middle line:84%
But, fortunately,
for the ground state,

00:51:09.330 --> 00:51:11.610 align:middle line:84%
there is additional
trick which, actually,

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:16.880 align:middle line:84%
you don't need to use the ground
state wave function at all, OK?

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.630 align:middle line:84%
So, now, I tell you
this additional trick.

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:21.150 align:middle line:84%
But this trick is only
specific to the vacuum, OK?

00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:23.490 align:middle line:84%
You cannot apply it
to other states, OK?

00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:24.990 align:middle line:90%
So this is specific to vacuum.

00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:28.220 align:middle line:90%


00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:31.350 align:middle line:84%
So, now, let's forget
about this thing, OK?

00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's forget
about this thing.

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:38.010 align:middle line:90%
Start coming back from here, OK?

00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:39.720 align:middle line:84%
So, now, let's coming
back from here.

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's coming
back from here.

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Just consider-- again, I take
limit t goes to plus infinity,

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and t prime goes
to minus infinity.

00:51:56.600 --> 00:52:03.255 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at this object x
t, x, x prime, t prime, OK?

00:52:03.255 --> 00:52:09.630 align:middle line:90%


00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:11.380 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:18.160 align:middle line:84%
So, now, again, we are going
to insert identity, OK?

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, we are, again, going
to insert the identity.

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And, now, we insert the
identity in a different way.

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Again, we insert
the identity here

00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:28.890 align:middle line:90%
and insert the identity here.

00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:32.880 align:middle line:84%
But, now, we insert identity
expressed in the complete set

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:35.660 align:middle line:90%
of energy eigenstates, OK?

00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:40.690 align:middle line:84%
So, now, we insert the complete
set of energy eigenstates.

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:44.700 align:middle line:90%
I just formally label it by m.

00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:47.130 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So, now, let's just insert
in the two places, OK?

00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:52.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.370 align:middle line:90%


00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:58.850 align:middle line:84%
OK, so, now, we
have two identities.

00:52:58.850 --> 00:52:59.960 align:middle line:90%
Then we have n and m.

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.970 align:middle line:90%


00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:04.410 align:middle line:90%
We have n and m.

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:06.690 align:middle line:90%
So, now, I will--

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:07.990 align:middle line:90%
so you keep this in mind.

00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:11.010 align:middle line:84%
I will not copy this
over and over, OK?

00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:14.010 align:middle line:84%
So keep this limit in
mind-- always, t prime.

00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:17.500 align:middle line:90%
It goes to minus infinity.

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:18.900 align:middle line:90%
So, now, we have--

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and then we have x t
with m, and m x with n,

00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:31.410 align:middle line:90%
and n with x prime, t prime, OK?

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:44.920 align:middle line:90%


00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:46.555 align:middle line:84%
So, now, if we
look at this sum--

00:53:46.555 --> 00:53:54.550 align:middle line:90%


00:53:54.550 --> 00:54:01.590 align:middle line:84%
if n and m equal to 0, this
is the object we want, OK?

00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:03.240 align:middle line:90%
This is the object we want.

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:07.090 align:middle line:84%
But this also contains
many, many other stuff.

00:54:07.090 --> 00:54:11.100 align:middle line:84%
So, now, we will use the
trick to isolate n equal to 0

00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:13.650 align:middle line:90%
and m equal to 0 piece, OK?

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:14.655 align:middle line:90%
You isolate that piece.

00:54:14.655 --> 00:54:17.322 align:middle line:90%


00:54:17.322 --> 00:54:18.780 align:middle line:84%
That's what we are
going to do now.

00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:27.780 align:middle line:90%


00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:35.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is the commonly-used
technique in quantum field

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.510 align:middle line:90%
theory--

00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:38.370 align:middle line:84%
not only in quantum
field theory, actually--

00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:41.145 align:middle line:90%
in many areas of physics.

00:54:41.145 --> 00:54:45.480 align:middle line:90%


00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:47.400 align:middle line:90%
So, now, let's first--

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:49.410 align:middle line:84%
to explain the trick,
let's look at this object.

00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:52.180 align:middle line:90%


00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:53.910 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at
this object, OK?

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:56.630 align:middle line:90%


00:54:56.630 --> 00:55:02.600 align:middle line:84%
So this object is limit t
prime goes to minus infinity,

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:07.640 align:middle line:84%
some energy eigenstate
n and x prime, t prime.

00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:10.620 align:middle line:84%
So, again, this is written
in the Heisenberg picture.

00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:15.050 align:middle line:84%
So we need to-- so translate
to your more familiar language

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:16.830 align:middle line:90%
of the Schrodinger picture.

00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:25.050 align:middle line:84%
So we need to write it as n, and
then you have expansion i H t

00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:28.170 align:middle line:90%
prime and then x prime, OK?

00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:33.080 align:middle line:84%
So, now, it is the standard
Schrodinger picture state.

00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.690 align:middle line:90%


00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:37.720 align:middle line:84%
So, now, since n is
the energy eigenstate,

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:40.450 align:middle line:90%
we can just act this one, OK?

00:55:40.450 --> 00:55:45.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is just equal
to limit t prime goes

00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:58.450 align:middle line:84%
to minus infinity exponential
i En t prime and x prime, OK?

00:55:58.450 --> 00:56:03.580 align:middle line:90%


00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So, now, we will try to
select the ground state.

00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And we do that by
doing the following.

00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:24.990 align:middle line:84%
So, now, imagine giving En
a small imaginary part, OK?

00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:30.500 align:middle line:90%


00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:39.265 align:middle line:84%
OK, imagine-- yeah, take En
goes to En 1 minus epsilon.

00:56:39.265 --> 00:56:44.500 align:middle line:90%


00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:50.250 align:middle line:84%
So epsilon is a small
positive number,

00:56:50.250 --> 00:56:53.860 align:middle line:90%
which is equivalent to taking--

00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:56.580 align:middle line:84%
or, you just take
H, your Hamiltonian,

00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:59.830 align:middle line:90%
take into 1 minus epsilon, OK?

00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Give your Hamiltonian a
slightly imaginary part, OK?

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:07.100 align:middle line:90%
It's equivalent, OK?

00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:12.490 align:middle line:90%
So, now, with this--

00:57:12.490 --> 00:57:15.940 align:middle line:90%
and now we have--

00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:22.120 align:middle line:84%
so limit t prime goes
to minus infinity.

00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:32.920 align:middle line:84%
So, now, we have exponential i
En, 1 minus i epsilon t prime,

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:36.330 align:middle line:90%
and n x prime, OK?

00:57:36.330 --> 00:57:39.050 align:middle line:90%


00:57:39.050 --> 00:57:40.310 align:middle line:90%
So this is just equal to that.

00:57:40.310 --> 00:57:48.930 align:middle line:90%


00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:51.920 align:middle line:90%
So, now, you see--

00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:56.600 align:middle line:84%
suppose we normalize
our state so that--

00:57:56.600 --> 00:58:06.210 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so, by definition, En
are greater than E0 for n

00:58:06.210 --> 00:58:11.770 align:middle line:90%
greater than 0, OK?

00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:18.400 align:middle line:84%
So the effect of putting epsilon
here, when you multiply it,

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:21.850 align:middle line:84%
it still give you a
factor like this--

00:58:21.850 --> 00:58:25.090 align:middle line:90%
epsilon En times t prime, OK?

00:58:25.090 --> 00:58:27.835 align:middle line:84%
So give you a real
factor like this.

00:58:27.835 --> 00:58:35.700 align:middle line:90%


00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:37.190 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:42.270 align:middle line:84%
So, now, t prime goes
to minus infinity.

00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:45.230 align:middle line:90%
And the En is greater than E0.

00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:50.320 align:middle line:84%
So for any state which
is not ground state,

00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:53.080 align:middle line:84%
this factor will be
exponentially small--

00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:53.860 align:middle line:90%
goes to 0.

00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:56.890 align:middle line:84%
So the ratio between this
factor and the ground state

00:58:56.890 --> 00:59:02.170 align:middle line:84%
goes to 0 for any
excited states, OK?

00:59:02.170 --> 00:59:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Because of the En minus
E0 greater than 0.

00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And this goes to minus
infinity, and the epsilon

00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:08.980 align:middle line:90%
is positive, OK?

00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:12.800 align:middle line:90%


00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:19.450 align:middle line:84%
So this implies--
so we continue.

00:59:19.450 --> 00:59:19.950 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:24.310 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- so let's
continue over here.

00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So this means we get,
essentially, 0 for n

00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:36.131 align:middle line:84%
not equal to 0 and
the exponential i

00:59:36.131 --> 00:59:45.825 align:middle line:84%
E0 1 minus epsilon t prime
for n equal to 0, OK?

00:59:45.825 --> 00:59:49.250 align:middle line:90%


00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:53.830 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: If you want
to formally show this--

00:59:53.830 --> 00:59:58.755 align:middle line:84%
that all energy levels that
are not in a ground state

00:59:58.755 --> 01:00:02.620 align:middle line:84%
get exponentially suppressed, do
you divide by the ground state

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:05.740 align:middle line:84%
energy into the [INAUDIBLE]
energy, or how do you do it?

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:09.558 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Oh, you just
take out the overall factor

01:00:09.558 --> 01:00:10.975 align:middle line:84%
corresponding to
the ground state.

01:00:10.975 --> 01:00:14.240 align:middle line:90%


01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, then all the other
coefficients will go to 0.

01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:19.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:21.430 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: What is
the justification

01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:24.400 align:middle line:84%
or why are we allowed to
add a small imaginary part

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.570 align:middle line:90%
to the energy?

01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:27.670 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: It's a
mathematical trick.

01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:28.340 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:31.537 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: At the end of the
day, we set epsilon go to 0.

01:00:31.537 --> 01:00:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And then you go back to
your original Hamiltonian.

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:35.390 align:middle line:90%
So this is just a trick.

01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:37.520 align:middle line:84%
If you're doing
this order properly,

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:41.490 align:middle line:84%
it just naturally selects
the ground state for you.

01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:42.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just a pure,
mathematical trick.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:46.420 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Epsilon has to
have a certain sign, right?

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:49.300 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, epsilon--
when we write this epsilon,

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:53.500 align:middle line:84%
we always assume epsilon
is greater than 0.

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.260 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:58.352 align:middle line:90%
You always assume-- yeah.

01:00:58.352 --> 01:01:00.504 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:00.504 --> 01:01:00.825 align:middle line:90%


01:01:00.825 --> 01:01:01.450 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Hmm?

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:04.908 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I don't see why
you can do that [INAUDIBLE]..

01:01:04.908 --> 01:01:05.825 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Oh, I can--

01:01:05.825 --> 01:01:08.630 align:middle line:90%


01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:11.000 align:middle line:90%
I have a path integral.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And, essentially, I
can design the rule

01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:19.070 align:middle line:84%
I want, as far as, at
the end of the day,

01:01:19.070 --> 01:01:24.210 align:middle line:90%
I get the desired quantity.

01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:24.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.340 align:middle line:84%
But the order of limit
is very important.

01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:29.110 align:middle line:90%
You have to be very careful.

01:01:29.110 --> 01:01:30.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:32.115 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:01:32.115 --> 01:01:33.490 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Can you
get around this

01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:37.290 align:middle line:84%
with some sort of a stationary
phase or saddle point

01:01:37.290 --> 01:01:37.890 align:middle line:90%
expansion?

01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:39.265 align:middle line:84%
Because, in the
end, you're going

01:01:39.265 --> 01:01:40.860 align:middle line:84%
to be integrating
exponential factors.

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And so the term
that dominates is--

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:45.360 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: No, here, it's not--

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.080 align:middle line:84%
no, here, you cannot do a
stationary phase because if you

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.760 align:middle line:90%
just-- yeah, yeah.

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:55.370 align:middle line:84%
You really need to suppress
the other contribution--

01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:56.480 align:middle line:90%
not only suppress them.

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.470 align:middle line:90%
Just, they have to go to 0.

01:01:58.470 --> 01:02:03.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah-- genuinely go to 0.

01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:09.670 align:middle line:84%
OK, so, similarly, with the
same trick, just the same thing,

01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:14.100 align:middle line:84%
in one shot, it
selects n equal to 0.

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:17.340 align:middle line:84%
But you see, actually, it
also selects m equal to 0

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:22.530 align:middle line:84%
because, you see,
with the same sign,

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:27.660 align:middle line:84%
you can easily check yourself
when t goes to plus infinity.

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:31.660 align:middle line:90%


01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:38.740 align:middle line:84%
So these now become limit
t go to plus infinity,

01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:47.610 align:middle line:84%
say, exponential minus i En,
1 minus epsilon t times x n.

01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And then, again, this become
0 for m not equal to 0.

01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:01.635 align:middle line:90%
And then the ground state--

01:03:01.635 --> 01:03:07.536 align:middle line:90%


01:03:07.536 --> 01:03:08.700 align:middle line:90%
for n equal to--

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:13.137 align:middle line:90%


01:03:13.137 --> 01:03:18.750 align:middle line:90%
for m equal to 0, OK?

01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:27.420 align:middle line:84%
So this simple trick beautifully
selects the m equal to 0

01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.040 align:middle line:90%
and n equal to 0 piece, OK?

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.000 align:middle line:90%
So, now, we can write--

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.650 align:middle line:90%


01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:37.710 align:middle line:84%
so this is just the ground
state wave function.

01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is just the ground
state wave function, OK?

01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:46.660 align:middle line:84%
So, now, we have limit t
prime goes to minus infinity,

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:55.800 align:middle line:84%
and t goes to plus infinity,
x t, x, x prime, t prime.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.820 align:middle line:84%
So, now, you go to-- so you have
the ground state wave function

01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:10.770 align:middle line:90%
star, x prime, x, now 0, x, 0.

01:04:10.770 --> 01:04:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
this phase factor.

01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:20.510 align:middle line:90%


01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:22.775 align:middle line:84%
And with everything
else, goes to 0, OK?

01:04:22.775 --> 01:04:31.560 align:middle line:90%


01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:37.300 align:middle line:90%
So we get that, OK?

01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the-- so,
now, after those factors,

01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:45.730 align:middle line:90%
we get what we want, OK?

01:04:45.730 --> 01:04:46.690 align:middle line:90%
We get what we want.

01:04:46.690 --> 01:04:53.156 align:middle line:90%


01:04:53.156 --> 01:04:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So, but, still, you have
lots of lowering factors.

01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:00.220 align:middle line:90%
But they can be easily got off.

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:03.910 align:middle line:84%
They can be easily get rid
of using the following.

01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:16.700 align:middle line:90%


01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.580 align:middle line:90%
So, now, you also--

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:23.620 align:middle line:84%
similarly, the exact
same reason, whether--

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:26.260 align:middle line:84%
so in this discussion,
whether you have x there,

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:28.420 align:middle line:90%
or what's the form of x?

01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:29.590 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter.

01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:32.030 align:middle line:90%
x can be anything.

01:05:32.030 --> 01:05:34.180 align:middle line:90%
So x can be anything.

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:38.740 align:middle line:84%
So you can just take
x equal to 1, OK?

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And then you also have limit
t goes to plus infinity.

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.200 align:middle line:90%
t prime goes to minus infinity.

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:51.160 align:middle line:90%
The x t, x prime, t prime--

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:59.110 align:middle line:84%
so this is also equal to psi
0 x, psi 0 star, x prime.

01:05:59.110 --> 01:06:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And, now, it's the 0
with 0 because the you've

01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:05.290 align:middle line:90%
set x equal to 1, OK?

01:06:05.290 --> 01:06:06.920 align:middle line:90%
And then you just ground state.

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:09.220 align:middle line:90%
And so this is just equal to 1.

01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the same factor, OK?

01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:27.760 align:middle line:90%


01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:34.740 align:middle line:84%
So, now, we can
just find G n, OK?

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.050 align:middle line:90%
So this object is Gn.

01:06:36.050 --> 01:06:38.560 align:middle line:90%


01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:41.305 align:middle line:84%
So Gn, then, can be defined
as the ratio between the two.

01:06:41.305 --> 01:06:46.030 align:middle line:90%


01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:47.020 align:middle line:90%
We take the limit--

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:48.550 align:middle line:90%
t plus infinity.

01:06:48.550 --> 01:06:52.600 align:middle line:90%
t prime goes to minus infinity.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:07:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Have x t, x prime, t prime,
and x t, and x, x t, OK?

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:06.770 align:middle line:84%
You can just find that as
a ratio between the two.

01:07:06.770 --> 01:07:12.620 align:middle line:84%
So this gives you the
expression for calculating

01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:14.720 align:middle line:90%
this correlation function.

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And the x is any
time-ordered product, OK?

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And so, now, for each of them,
we know the path integral.

01:07:23.130 --> 01:07:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And then you can just write
down the path integral for each.

01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:29.930 align:middle line:90%


01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:33.800 align:middle line:84%
So, now, you see this
G n is, in principle,

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:36.500 align:middle line:84%
a physical observable
that's actually

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:39.720 align:middle line:84%
involving the ratio of
two path integrals--

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:44.130 align:middle line:84%
one without any x
and one with some x,

01:07:44.130 --> 01:07:47.260 align:middle line:84%
with your desired
correlation functions.

01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:50.550 align:middle line:84%
So I mentioned before that
when you evaluate the path

01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:52.740 align:middle line:84%
integrals, you will
get that kind C

01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:54.120 align:middle line:90%
determinant or those things.

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:56.340 align:middle line:84%
They just cancel between
upstairs and downstairs.

01:07:56.340 --> 01:08:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Later, we will see
explicitly, OK?

01:08:00.050 --> 01:08:02.855 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this is a
beautiful formula, OK?

01:08:02.855 --> 01:08:06.530 align:middle line:90%


01:08:06.530 --> 01:08:08.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:10.310 align:middle line:90%
And then you don't have to--

01:08:10.310 --> 01:08:14.630 align:middle line:90%


01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:15.160 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so all those
factors canceled.

01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:19.250 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to know the
ground state wave function.

01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:20.917 align:middle line:84%
You can just perform
that path integral.

01:08:20.917 --> 01:08:25.450 align:middle line:90%


01:08:25.450 --> 01:08:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And here, in principle, you
can also take arbitrary x and x

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.300 align:middle line:90%
prime, OK?

01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:39.979 align:middle line:84%
You can take arbitrary
x and x prime.

01:08:39.979 --> 01:08:41.689 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

01:08:41.689 --> 01:08:44.479 align:middle line:84%
So, conventionally, we just
take x equal to x prime equal

01:08:44.479 --> 01:08:49.899 align:middle line:90%
to 0, just for simplicity, OK?

01:08:49.899 --> 01:08:51.270 align:middle line:90%
We can just take them to 0.

01:08:51.270 --> 01:09:06.540 align:middle line:90%


01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:07.040 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:10.270 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:11.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:09:11.170 --> 01:09:14.199 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Why can you
specify both points

01:09:14.199 --> 01:09:17.080 align:middle line:90%
in your [INAUDIBLE]?

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:20.609 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I just-- the
only thing matters is there--

01:09:20.609 --> 01:09:24.270 align:middle line:84%
so they only come
into this prefactor,

01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:25.979 align:middle line:84%
and then cancelled
between the two.

01:09:25.979 --> 01:09:27.750 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:31.710 align:middle line:84%
So all the factors there
and these factors, they

01:09:31.710 --> 01:09:32.640 align:middle line:90%
just cancel.

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And you're just left with this
x0 left, so it doesn't matter.

01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:40.290 align:middle line:84%
They cancel anyway,
so it doesn't matter

01:09:40.290 --> 01:09:43.340 align:middle line:90%
where you put x and x prime.

01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:43.973 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:09:43.973 --> 01:09:45.890 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So we didn't
actually take the limit

01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:47.760 align:middle line:84%
as epsilon moves
to 0, or anything,

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:49.580 align:middle line:90%
so it doesn't actually matter.

01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:52.080 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: So, normally, when
you calculate that at the end,

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.939 align:middle line:84%
and then you take
epsilon goes to 0.

01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:58.370 align:middle line:84%
So we just, normally,
leave that implicit.

01:09:58.370 --> 01:09:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, when you do
the path integral,

01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:02.330 align:middle line:90%
you keep a small epsilon.

01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So after you finish, in the end,
you take the epsilon goes to 0.

01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:09.463 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:10:09.463 --> 01:10:10.130 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Also, on why would you take
x and x prime equals 0--

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.440 align:middle line:90%
doesn't our path integral--

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:19.700 align:middle line:84%
the bounds-- depend on x
and x prime that you choose?

01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:22.550 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, the bound
does not depend on it.

01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:27.290 align:middle line:84%
The path integral is only
limited by t prime and t.

01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, initial value,
they are the same--

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:34.040 align:middle line:84%
of course, specific value
of this path integral

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.670 align:middle line:90%
will depend on x and x prime.

01:10:35.670 --> 01:10:39.260 align:middle line:84%
But they cancel between
upstairs and downstairs.

01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:40.250 align:middle line:90%
So they cancelled.

01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:40.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And so, in the end,
this right-hand side

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.140 align:middle line:84%
does not depend
on x and x prime.

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:48.890 align:middle line:90%


01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, also, you see here, if
this formula makes any sense,

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:57.140 align:middle line:84%
the left-hand side does not
depend on x and x prime.

01:10:57.140 --> 01:11:00.110 align:middle line:84%
So the right-hand side must
not depend on x and x prime,

01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:05.180 align:middle line:84%
otherwise, this formula
immediately wrong.

01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:06.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:15.335 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] have to
keep the small epsilon back

01:11:15.335 --> 01:11:17.746 align:middle line:90%
in [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:17.746 --> 01:11:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So, again, we take limit
as epsilon goes to 0.

01:11:20.770 --> 01:11:22.020 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.

01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:22.920 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just when you
do the calculation,

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.527 align:middle line:90%
you keep a small epsilon.

01:11:26.527 --> 01:11:28.860 align:middle line:84%
When you do the path integral,
you keep a small epsilon.

01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:31.570 align:middle line:84%
But when you finally
calculate the final answer,

01:11:31.570 --> 01:11:33.880 align:middle line:90%
you can set epsilon to 0.

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:37.122 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Do we do that before
we take the t to infinity,

01:11:37.122 --> 01:11:39.590 align:middle line:90%
also, or does it matter?

01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:42.710 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, you have
to keep an epsilon.

01:11:42.710 --> 01:11:45.000 align:middle line:90%
This, you have to take first.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.120 align:middle line:84%
So this is part of
your calculation.

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:50.420 align:middle line:84%
You have to always
take this first

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:52.250 align:middle line:84%
because the final
answer also does not

01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:54.050 align:middle line:90%
depend on t and t prime.

01:11:54.050 --> 01:11:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And because this is the vacuum,
this correlation function

01:11:57.770 --> 01:12:00.200 align:middle line:84%
does not depend on
your t and t prime.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:03.980 align:middle line:90%
So you always set the--

01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:08.480 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you keep a small
epsilon, take this limit first,

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.550 align:middle line:90%
and do the calculation.

01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:11.960 align:middle line:90%
Do the calculation.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
calculate everything,

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:18.720 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the day,
then you set epsilon to 0.

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And then that guarantees
you chose the vacuum.

01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:27.130 align:middle line:90%


01:12:27.130 --> 01:12:29.414 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:12:29.414 --> 01:12:35.190 align:middle line:84%
There's one more trick
we have to do, OK?

01:12:35.190 --> 01:12:35.690 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

01:12:35.690 --> 01:12:37.340 align:middle line:90%
There are too many tricks.

01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.945 align:middle line:84%
There's one more
trick we have to do.

01:12:38.945 --> 01:12:41.810 align:middle line:90%


01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So, now, we have told
you how to calculate

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.610 align:middle line:90%
this guy for arbitrary x.

01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:55.220 align:middle line:90%
But, often, it's actually not--

01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:58.940 align:middle line:84%
it's not the smartest
way to directly calculate

01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:03.050 align:middle line:90%
such an n-point function, OK?

01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:06.950 align:middle line:90%
It's often not the smartest way.

01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:12.770 align:middle line:84%
So there's something a
little bit more clever.

01:13:12.770 --> 01:13:14.632 align:middle line:84%
It's called
generating functional.

01:13:14.632 --> 01:13:17.350 align:middle line:90%


01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So some of you may have seen
this, say, in your high school

01:13:21.790 --> 01:13:23.290 align:middle line:90%
math competition.

01:13:23.290 --> 01:13:30.790 align:middle line:90%


01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:35.180 align:middle line:84%
So suppose we want to do
an integral like this, OK?

01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:39.270 align:middle line:84%
So let's do-- again, let's go
back to our ordinary integral.

01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:42.590 align:middle line:84%
So let's just suppose we want
to do integral like this.

01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:43.800 align:middle line:90%
So do you have a parallel?

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:46.310 align:middle line:90%
Let's just say-- say this.

01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:49.190 align:middle line:84%
We have some phase, like what
you do in the path integral.

01:13:49.190 --> 01:13:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And we want to calculate
the x to the power m OK?

01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:55.100 align:middle line:90%
n is some integer.

01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, here, like you have
an n-point function--

01:13:58.010 --> 01:14:01.372 align:middle line:84%
suppose we want
to calculate this.

01:14:01.372 --> 01:14:02.830 align:middle line:84%
So you can just
calculate this guy.

01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:03.760 align:middle line:90%
It's fine, OK?

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:07.390 align:middle line:90%
But there's a better way.

01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:09.790 align:middle line:90%
Often, there's a better way.

01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Instead of calculating
this for individual n,

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:21.540 align:middle line:84%
you can actually consider
the following quantity, Z a,

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:30.830 align:middle line:84%
which is defined to be dx
exponential i lambda fx, then

01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:32.590 align:middle line:90%
plus i--

01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:37.300 align:middle line:90%
say ax, OK?

01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:41.060 align:middle line:90%
So you consider this object.

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:44.110 align:middle line:84%
so this object, when you
expand this exponential--

01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:49.710 align:middle line:90%


01:14:49.710 --> 01:14:52.720 align:middle line:90%
yeah, so maybe I will--

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:57.640 align:middle line:84%
I think I don't
need this anymore.

01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:59.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let me just erase this.

01:14:59.170 --> 01:15:19.900 align:middle line:90%


01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:20.910 align:middle line:90%
So, now, if you--

01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:23.760 align:middle line:84%
so why we are interested
in this object?

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Because imagine you expand this
exponential factor, and then,

01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:35.700 align:middle line:84%
essentially, you get Z a
is exponential n equal to 0

01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:43.700 align:middle line:84%
to infinity, n
factorial i a n, Zn, So?

01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:45.830 align:middle line:84%
If you expand this
thing in power series

01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:48.590 align:middle line:90%
of a, a power series--

01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:51.650 align:middle line:84%
if you expand this and
then just n-th term

01:15:51.650 --> 01:15:54.910 align:middle line:90%
will give you an x power n.

01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And then it's the
same in that we just

01:15:56.770 --> 01:16:01.870 align:middle line:84%
expand this Z a in power
series, and then the Z n

01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:04.390 align:middle line:84%
would be the n-th
coefficient, OK?

01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:13.600 align:middle line:84%
So if you compute Z a in one
shot, and then the easy Z n,

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:17.020 align:middle line:84%
you can just do by
a Taylor series.

01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:18.730 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:16:18.730 --> 01:16:26.710 align:middle line:84%
So, sometimes, we also write
Zn as, say, i to the power n.

01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:31.210 align:middle line:84%
Then you take n-th
derivative of Za over a,

01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and then you set
a equal to 0, OK?

01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:36.830 align:middle line:90%
So this is the same thing.

01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:41.184 align:middle line:84%
So when you take n
derivatives of a,

01:16:41.184 --> 01:16:43.600 align:middle line:90%
you get rid of the earlier--

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.940 align:middle line:90%
the lower powers.

01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And then the higher
powers you get

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:50.960 align:middle line:84%
rid of by setting
a equal to 0, OK?

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And then let's just pick
this term, pick Zn term.

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:58.730 align:middle line:90%


01:16:58.730 --> 01:17:00.530 align:middle line:84%
So Za is called the
generating function.

01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:08.520 align:middle line:90%


01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:09.487 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:17:09.487 --> 01:17:10.320 align:middle line:90%
Generating function.

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:16.760 align:middle line:90%


01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:18.320 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:21.860 align:middle line:84%
So, now, when we want
to-- so one final remark.

01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:23.855 align:middle line:84%
So, now, we want to
compute this guy.

01:17:23.855 --> 01:17:26.760 align:middle line:90%


01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:37.320 align:middle line:84%
So this Gn is equal to t,
x1 to xn, so x t1 and x tn.

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:41.400 align:middle line:90%


01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Again, instead of
computing each one of them,

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:47.900 align:middle line:84%
we can consider such a
so-called generating function

01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:49.580 align:middle line:90%
or generation of this idea.

01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:53.700 align:middle line:90%
We can consider Z J t.

01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:56.880 align:middle line:90%


01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.290 align:middle line:90%
We can consider this object--

01:17:58.290 --> 01:18:06.340 align:middle line:84%
DX(t) exponential
i S, x t, and, now,

01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:17.280 align:middle line:84%
add i dt from minus infinity
to plus infinity, J t, x t, OK?

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:21.430 align:middle line:84%
So, remember, this is
just the path integral.

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:23.580 align:middle line:84%
So let's just look
at the upstairs, OK?

01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:26.110 align:middle line:90%


01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Exponential x,
exponential i S x(t).

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So, now, this starts
the same thing.

01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:42.350 align:middle line:84%
So, now, if you take this,
imagine you expand this factor

01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:45.020 align:middle line:90%
and then to n-th power.

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Then you will generate this
term as a coefficient, OK?

01:18:47.630 --> 01:18:53.720 align:middle line:84%
We will discuss that in
more detail next time, OK?

01:18:53.720 --> 01:19:00.030 align:middle line:84%
So, often, instead of
computing this object directly,

01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:03.480 align:middle line:84%
we compute a generating
functional, so-called

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:07.230 align:middle line:84%
generating functional,
which often

01:19:07.230 --> 01:19:09.820 align:middle line:90%
makes things much easier, OK?

01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:13.420 align:middle line:90%


01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so with this
preparation, and then

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:22.510 align:middle line:84%
we are ready to tackle
how to treat this thing--

01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:27.190 align:middle line:84%
how to actually find such
object in quantum mechanics.

01:19:27.190 --> 01:19:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And once we have that, doing
field theory will be automatic.

01:19:31.210 --> 01:19:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you will,
then, know how

01:19:34.450 --> 01:19:37.390 align:middle line:84%
to actually calculate the
scattering amplitude, which

01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:40.660 align:middle line:90%
is a good achievement.

01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:43.500 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's stop here.

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:48.000 align:middle line:90%
