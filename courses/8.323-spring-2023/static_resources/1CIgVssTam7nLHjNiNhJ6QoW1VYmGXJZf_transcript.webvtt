[CLICKING]

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.950 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: OK.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:12.450 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.930 align:middle line:84%
So last lecture, we
talked about the property

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.230 align:middle line:84%
of this propagator,
which is defined

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:31.880 align:middle line:84%
to be x, x prime which is
also the same as phi x,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.910 align:middle line:90%
phi x prime here.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.140 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.010 align:middle line:90%
So this object, we discussed.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.630 align:middle line:84%
So conceptually, it
can be considered--

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.330 align:middle line:90%
so you have two interpretations.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.660 align:middle line:90%
So one is from here.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:57.840 align:middle line:84%
So this roughly can be
heuristically interpreted

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:84%
as the transition amplitude for
a particle from x to x prime.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, so heuristically,
you can think of it, say,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.460 align:middle line:90%
if you have a point--

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.090 align:middle line:84%
say, if you have a
space-time point, x

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.550 align:middle line:90%
prime has another points x.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And then you ask, what's
the transition amplitude

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.894 align:middle line:90%
from x prime to x?

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:40.700 align:middle line:84%
OK, so one way to interpret
this object is that.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And as I emphasize, this
is only heuristically,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.080 align:middle line:84%
because this does
not really describe

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.880 align:middle line:90%
a generally localized state.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:84%
It's only a approximately
localized state, OK?

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, the
second interpretation

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.315 align:middle line:90%
is the correlation function.

00:02:03.315 --> 00:02:10.130 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:84%
It describes correlations
of phi between, say, x.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just correlations,
square correlations

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:39.190 align:middle line:84%
between the value of phi at
x prime and the value of phi

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.755 align:middle line:90%
at x.

00:02:39.755 --> 00:02:48.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is the
interpretation most convenient,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.140 align:middle line:84%
for example, from condensed
matter perspective

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.900 align:middle line:84%
if your phi, say,
describes average spins.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:05.500 align:middle line:84%
So similarly, the
G minus, which is

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:84%
defined to be in
the opposite order,

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.040 align:middle line:90%
also have two interpretations.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is like a transition
from x to x prime.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so if I draw x and
if I still draw x that way,

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.470 align:middle line:84%
so it's like a transition
amplitude like this,

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.610 align:middle line:90%
from x to x prime.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.350 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.690 align:middle line:84%
So you can similarly interpret
the other using this language,

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:84%
for example, this Feynman,
which is theta G plus x, x prime

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.240 align:middle line:90%
plus x minus.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And then this means that when
t is greater than t prime,

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.660 align:middle line:84%
say, for now, let's
take this to be

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.700 align:middle line:90%
the direction of time going up.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.339 align:middle line:84%
And now if the x has a
later time than x prime,

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:25.730 align:middle line:84%
and then describe the
transition from x prime to x.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:26.230 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:34.930 align:middle line:84%
But if the x prime has a larger
time, and x has a smaller time,

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.410 align:middle line:84%
and then describe the opposite
direction from x to x prime.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.340 align:middle line:84%
But in both cases, you always
go from the smaller time

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.090 align:middle line:90%
to bigger time.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.170 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And so we often
call this, also GF,

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.670 align:middle line:84%
the time-ordered
correlation function.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.270 align:middle line:90%
So the GF is also called--

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.670 align:middle line:84%
so it's called the
Feynman-Green functions.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:01.480 align:middle line:84%
It's also called the
time-ordered correlation

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.980 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:10.850 align:middle line:90%


00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And then we wrote
down the expression.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.410 align:middle line:84%
So we calculate the expression
explicitly for G plus.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And we also almost finished
the expression for--

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.780 align:middle line:84%
yeah, similarly, you can
do retarded et cetera.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And also, so any
questions on this?

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.950 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So on
the set, we showed

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.910 align:middle line:84%
that for the complex scalar
field, phi x phi x' is 0.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:38.960 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.335 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So what
does that mean?

00:05:40.335 --> 00:05:41.600 align:middle line:90%
There's no commutator?

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.570 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah,
yeah, because of the charge

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.950 align:middle line:90%
conservation.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot propagate from
one particle to the other

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.790 align:middle line:90%
particle.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.530 align:middle line:84%
So because phi, when
it acts on the 0,

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.260 align:middle line:90%
generates, say, a particle.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.960 align:middle line:84%
But when phi acts on
the left, it actually

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.690 align:middle line:90%
generates the antiparticle.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.100 align:middle line:84%
So a particle cannot become
a antiparticle, right?

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.280 align:middle line:84%
So only when phi and the
phi dagger, and then it's

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.810 align:middle line:90%
from just the particle.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:11.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.020 align:middle line:90%


00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.950 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.280 align:middle line:90%


00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.200 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.770 align:middle line:90%
So we also discussed the--

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.670 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so we wrote down
this formula for R,

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:36.290 align:middle line:90%
A, F, say, in coordinate space.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.030 align:middle line:84%
So x prime can be written
as a Fourier transform.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:50.360 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:56.192 align:middle line:84%
I think it's k squared
plus m squared.

00:06:56.192 --> 00:06:57.905 align:middle line:90%
And let me just check the sign.

00:06:57.905 --> 00:07:00.730 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.380 align:middle line:90%
I think it's i or minus i.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, minus i.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.680 align:middle line:90%
So right, OK?

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And then we mentioned that this
factor actually has a pole.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.240 align:middle line:84%
In the downstairs, these
have the form omega squared--

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.140 align:middle line:84%
minus omega squared
plus omega k squared

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.510 align:middle line:90%
if you write it explicitly.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And then this quantity
becomes singular at--

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:44.985 align:middle line:84%
so singular at omega equal
to plus-minus omega k.

00:07:44.985 --> 00:07:47.305 align:middle line:90%


00:07:47.305 --> 00:07:47.805 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:47.805 --> 00:07:50.370 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And the singularity lies
on the integration contour

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.600 align:middle line:84%
if we consider a
complex omega plane.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And so here, one of the
integral is the omega.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And then the omega go
along the real axis.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.960 align:middle line:84%
So the integration goes
along the real axis.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And here is minus omega
k, here is omega k.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:18.800 align:middle line:84%
So you have singularity on
the integration contour.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And then different ways of going
around the singularity then

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:28.160 align:middle line:84%
give you different choice
of retarded and advanced

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.970 align:middle line:90%
and the Feynman.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And which one to
choose based on-- which

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.940 align:middle line:84%
control you should
choose, whether you

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.200 align:middle line:84%
should go around, go above,
or go below the singularity.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And depends on the
prescription for each of them.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So we discussed
that for G R, which

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:57.250 align:middle line:84%
is proportional to theta,
t minus t prime, then that

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:01.330 align:middle line:84%
means we should-- yeah, so let
me just draw the singularity.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.220 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.690 align:middle line:84%
So that means you actually
need to change your contour

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:14.200 align:middle line:84%
to go above the singularity, to
go above the both singularity.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that will guarantee
you to proportional

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:22.480 align:middle line:84%
to theta minus theta prime
when you do the integral--

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.300 align:middle line:84%
when you do the
integral, the omega

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:31.570 align:middle line:84%
integral using the contours
and using the contours.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, for G A, which
is proportional to theta t

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.320 align:middle line:90%
prime and t minus t prime--

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.540 align:middle line:84%
in order to guarantee
that, then you

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:50.760 align:middle line:84%
have to take your control
to be below the singularity,

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.210 align:middle line:90%
be below the singularity.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.675 align:middle line:84%
So this is omega,
real omega axis.

00:09:54.675 --> 00:09:57.230 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.660 align:middle line:90%
And for the Feynman--

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.610 align:middle line:84%
so the Feynman is
half and a half.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.370 align:middle line:84%
So there's a theta t minus
t prime part-- there's

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.280 align:middle line:90%
a theta t prime minus t part.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.510 align:middle line:90%
OK, if you try to check that--

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.670 align:middle line:84%
so we're not going
to detail it there.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Here we'll give you a
exercise for yourself.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.120 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to satisfy
that kind of condition

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.870 align:middle line:84%
when t greater than t
prime gives you G plus

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.820 align:middle line:84%
and when t smaller
than t prime gives you

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:37.760 align:middle line:84%
G minus, when you do
the contour integration,

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.570 align:middle line:84%
you have to do
the following way.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So for this one, you go below,
for this one you go from up.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.400 align:middle line:90%
OK, you go up.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
another way, which

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:56.780 align:middle line:84%
is G F tilde, which is the
opposite for G F in terms

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:57.860 align:middle line:90%
of time-ordering.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And then you will do the
opposite way over here.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, so altogether, there
are four different ways

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.460 align:middle line:84%
you can go around the
singularity that give you four

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.860 align:middle line:90%
different kind of functions.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.830 align:middle line:84%
OK, they give you four
different functions.

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:15.800 align:middle line:84%
So for those of you who are not
familiar with complex analysis

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:21.230 align:middle line:84%
or the contour integrals, try to
refresh yourself a little bit.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Because the complex
analysis is definitely

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.570 align:middle line:90%
a very, very powerful tool.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.930 align:middle line:84%
To be very familiar with
it is very important.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.130 align:middle line:90%


00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:37.000 align:middle line:84%
OK, so it's
allowing-- each time,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.150 align:middle line:84%
if you have to specifier
your contour like this--

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:43.600 align:middle line:84%
so if each time you have to
specify a contour like this,

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.960 align:middle line:90%
it's not convenient.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And the physicists developed
a more convenient way

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.650 align:middle line:84%
to treat all of
them in one shot.

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:59.300 align:middle line:84%
OK, so instead of going
around the contour like this,

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.680 align:middle line:84%
we just try to move
the singularity.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.480 align:middle line:84%
OK so we keep the
contour to be fixed,

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.240 align:middle line:84%
but we slightly move
the singularity.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.400 align:middle line:84%
OK, for example,
for the retarded,

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:18.500 align:middle line:84%
this is the same if I just
slightly move the singularity

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:23.140 align:middle line:84%
by a tiny bit below
the real axis.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So if my integral
contour is like this,

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.830 align:middle line:90%
then this is equivalent to that.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.620 align:middle line:84%
If this is just a tiny
part, then this one

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.570 align:middle line:90%
won't affect your answer.

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.300 align:middle line:84%
OK, and similarly
here, in this case,

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.000 align:middle line:84%
we just move both singularity
above a little bit.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, I move
one singularity above,

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.090 align:middle line:84%
move one singularity
down, in which case

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:46.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to
change my contour,

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.990 align:middle line:84%
just slightly change
my singularity.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And this can be achieved by
so-called epsilon prescription.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:13:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So a convenient trick
is in the-- for example,

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:10.900 align:middle line:84%
in the retarded case,
instead of this--

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:17.370 align:middle line:84%
so we always do the integral
with the same contour.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:24.180 align:middle line:84%
So we don't change the
contour, but we slightly

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:33.610 align:middle line:84%
change the integration to be
omega plus i epsilon squared

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:37.000 align:middle line:90%
plus omega k squared.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the downstairs
previously was minus omega

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.400 align:middle line:90%
squared plus omega k squared.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.070 align:middle line:90%
But now, I add a tiny--

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.800 align:middle line:90%
so epsilon is infinitesimal.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.027 align:middle line:90%
It's positive and infinitesimal.

00:13:54.027 --> 00:13:59.940 align:middle line:90%


00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:05.700 align:middle line:84%
So you see, by adding
such a tiny piece to here,

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.960 align:middle line:84%
when you solve
this singularity--

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.280 align:middle line:84%
so it's now omega plus i epsilon
equal to plus minus omega.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And then move the epsilon
to the other side,

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:21.620 align:middle line:84%
and then the solution
becomes minus i epsilon.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And then because
epsilon is positive,

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.710 align:middle line:84%
then this is slightly
in the lower half plane.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, for the advanced,
you just do a minus, OK?

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.895 align:middle line:84%
And then both
singularity will move up.

00:14:37.895 --> 00:14:38.770 align:middle line:90%
And for the Feynman--

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:43.930 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:47.035 align:middle line:84%
so the trick is you
can do the same thing.

00:14:47.035 --> 00:14:53.160 align:middle line:90%


00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.320 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, I still have i k.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.870 align:middle line:90%
So this is the minus i.

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.540 align:middle line:84%
So I just do k squared
plus m squared,

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.800 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing minus i epsilon,
rather than change the omega,

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and the whole thing
minus i epsilon.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:17.590 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.840 align:middle line:90%
And you can check yourself.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.150 align:middle line:84%
When you solve the
omega using this,

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:25.720 align:middle line:84%
this is the whole thing minus
i epsilon, in this case.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.940 align:middle line:84%
So for retarded and
advanced, you put it

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.470 align:middle line:90%
inside the omega squared.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.390 align:middle line:84%
But here, you put
it other side, OK?

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And then you can check
when you solve for omega.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Actually, you get
this situation.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.110 align:middle line:84%
One move up-- it
will actually move up

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:39.950 align:middle line:90%
and the positive move down.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:40.450 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:41.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.762 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Can you outline
how I would convince myself

00:15:43.762 --> 00:15:47.130 align:middle line:84%
that these two pictures
are equivalent?

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:50.600 align:middle line:84%
Are they going-- moving,
integrating with the contour

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:55.500 align:middle line:84%
that jumps out over or
under these poles for--

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:56.460 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.335 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because from the
contour point of view,

00:15:58.335 --> 00:16:03.300 align:middle line:84%
from the control
integration point of view,

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:84%
the precise shape of the
contour is not important.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:10.560 align:middle line:84%
It only matters what
singularity it encloses.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.830 align:middle line:84%
So as far as it encloses
these two singularity,

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:15.750 align:middle line:90%
and then the story is the same.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:19.050 align:middle line:84%
But since I changed the
singularity location only

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:20.400 align:middle line:90%
by epsilon--

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.610 align:middle line:84%
and in the end, I will
take this epsilon go to 0--

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and then the value
will be the same.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.510 align:middle line:90%


00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:29.840 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a very, very
simple, but very powerful

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:36.370 align:middle line:90%
trick.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.560 align:middle line:84%
This makes things
much more convenient

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:43.900 align:middle line:84%
when you do many manipulations
so that you don't

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.770 align:middle line:84%
have to constantly
worry about the contour,

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:50.005 align:middle line:90%
the precise contour you take.

00:16:50.005 --> 00:16:53.800 align:middle line:90%


00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.080 align:middle line:90%
Any other questions?

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:56.580 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:01.080 align:middle line:90%


00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.470 align:middle line:84%
So let me just give
some final remarks.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:09.260 align:middle line:84%
So this almost
concludes our discussion

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.589 align:middle line:90%
of the free field theory.

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:12.335 align:middle line:84%
So let me just give
some final remarks.

00:17:12.335 --> 00:17:21.319 align:middle line:90%


00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So as I mentioned, the G plus
and the G R and the retarded

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.960 align:middle line:90%
have many applications.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:40.160 align:middle line:90%


00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.020 align:middle line:90%
Saying, in condensed matter.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:47.390 align:middle line:84%
So you deal with them-- you
deal with them all the time.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And then this
Feynman propagator,

00:17:54.970 --> 00:18:03.630 align:middle line:84%
we will see it plays
a very important role

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:13.530 align:middle line:84%
in next chapter, which we will
start in the next few minutes.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.585 align:middle line:84%
So the G F will play
a very important role.

00:18:15.585 --> 00:18:18.650 align:middle line:90%


00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And so in addition
to these two points--

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.780 align:middle line:84%
so these are the correlation
function of two points, OK?

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.400 align:middle line:90%
Just the x and x prime.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.640 align:middle line:84%
You can, in principle, consider,
say, more general correlation

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.510 align:middle line:90%
functions.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:52.460 align:middle line:90%


00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Say, you can say, consider
an arbitrary state.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:07.520 align:middle line:90%


00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Say, for example, you can
just consider some state psi,

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:16.130 align:middle line:84%
and then you can consider
phi x1, phi x2, say, phi xn.

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:22.860 align:middle line:90%


00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.530 align:middle line:84%
So this is some
n-point function.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, what's normally
called n-point function,

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:29.967 align:middle line:90%
some general state, psi.

00:19:29.967 --> 00:19:31.425 align:middle line:84%
Psi does not have
to be the vacuum.

00:19:31.425 --> 00:19:36.320 align:middle line:90%


00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.110 align:middle line:84%
So general state--
remember, general state psi

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:43.250 align:middle line:84%
can all be built
from a and a dagger.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And the phi can also be
written this way, in a dagger.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.567 align:middle line:90%
So if you give me a state--

00:19:48.567 --> 00:19:50.150 align:middle line:84%
so I can, in principle,
calculate this

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:51.358 align:middle line:90%
for any correlation function.

00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:54.000 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this theory
is fully solved.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And then no matter
what you want me

00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:00.780 align:middle line:84%
to compute using what we
have developed so far,

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.600 align:middle line:90%
you can now compute them.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:09.640 align:middle line:84%
So this theory,
everything is computable.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And so now, let me just mention
one simple fact regarding

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.703 align:middle line:90%
the vacuum correlation function.

00:20:16.703 --> 00:20:18.745 align:middle line:84%
So let's consider the
n-point function of vacuum.

00:20:18.745 --> 00:20:22.690 align:middle line:90%


00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And then you can easily
convince yourself--

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, you can easily
convince yourself

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:48.990 align:middle line:84%
this factorize into sums of
product of two-point functions.

00:20:48.990 --> 00:21:06.050 align:middle line:90%


00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:84%
So this is simple
because a and a dagger,

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:90%
they have to be paired.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Because any a dagger
creates something out of 0

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:21.270 align:middle line:84%
has to be annihilated
by a somewhere later.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:25.250 align:middle line:84%
So that means all the a and
a dagger has to be paired.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And then that means
that they have to reduce

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.730 align:middle line:90%
to all the two-point functions.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:32.140 align:middle line:90%
OK, so you can check explicitly.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:37.360 align:middle line:84%
So for example, the simplest
is the four-point function.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:44.840 align:middle line:90%
So if you consider phi x, OK?

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:50.650 align:middle line:84%
So you can easily convince
yourself that the a dagger--

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:55.330 align:middle line:84%
when a dagger of this creates
on this, and then that can be,

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:58.330 align:middle line:90%
say, annihilated by any of them.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:01.790 align:middle line:90%
And so you can have, say--

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:05.210 align:middle line:84%
and similarly, a dagger
created by this one

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:07.060 align:middle line:84%
have to be annihilated
by some later.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.110 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
always pair them, OK?

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So you can show that
this just reduces

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.810 align:middle line:90%
to all possible pairings.

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:32.770 align:middle line:84%
So you can pair 3 and 4, or pair
1 and 4 and 2 and 3, or 1 and 3

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:34.130 align:middle line:90%
and 2 and 4.

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:37.665 align:middle line:84%
OK, you just write down
all possible pairings.

00:22:37.665 --> 00:22:39.415 align:middle line:84%
OK, just write down
all possible pairings.

00:22:39.415 --> 00:22:43.790 align:middle line:90%


00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:45.350 align:middle line:90%
So in free theory--

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:49.300 align:middle line:84%
so in this free theory, any
point functions in the vacuum,

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.120 align:middle line:84%
they just reduce to
the two-point function.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.730 align:middle line:84%
If you know the two-point
function, you know everything.

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:56.270 align:middle line:90%
OK, you know everything.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:00.870 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:04.385 align:middle line:84%
So this, I will give you as
an exercise to check yourself.

00:23:04.385 --> 00:23:10.050 align:middle line:90%


00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And then the final remark
is related to the problem 3,

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.980 align:middle line:90%
I think, in your Pset.

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:27.320 align:middle line:84%
So in addition to
phi, we can also

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.050 align:middle line:84%
consider more
complicated operators.

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:37.330 align:middle line:84%
We can consider, say,
so-called composite operators.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.950 align:middle line:90%


00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Means that we take the product
of phi, of which is momentum.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.160 align:middle line:90%
So we can have--

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.120 align:middle line:84%
say, we can consider
phi squared,

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:58.730 align:middle line:84%
phi cubed, say, the Hamiltonian
density, the stress tensor.

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So these are all involving
some product of phis.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.490 align:middle line:90%
Or its canonical momentum.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And so these are normally
called the composite operators.

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And as you should have
learned from your P

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:22.490 align:middle line:84%
set problem 3 that
those operators often

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:23.750 align:middle line:90%
are not well defined.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Because when you multiply
them at the same point,

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:29.210 align:middle line:90%
you will get a singularity.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.128 align:middle line:90%
You will get singular behavior.

00:24:31.128 --> 00:24:32.420 align:middle line:90%
You will get singular behavior.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And the really to
renormalize them, et cetera.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.930 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And so such kind of
divergent behavior

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.410 align:middle line:84%
is generic in
quantum field theory.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most important
parts of quantum field theory

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:51.350 align:middle line:84%
is to find sensible
ways to renormalize

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:58.040 align:middle line:84%
those divergent quantities in
the physically sensible way.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And the problem 3, it's the
first example you encounter.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And later, when we deal
with interacting theories,

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:10.170 align:middle line:84%
there are more complicated
examples, et cetera.

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:13.040 align:middle line:84%
OK, so do you have
any questions?

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:13.553 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:25:13.553 --> 00:25:14.970 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So I'm
a little confused

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:17.950 align:middle line:84%
on how to interpret this
n-point correlation function.

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:21.163 align:middle line:84%
Because for the two-point, we
have this heuristic condition

00:25:21.163 --> 00:25:22.033 align:middle line:90%
amplitude.

00:25:22.033 --> 00:25:22.700 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Right.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.367 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: But how do
you interpret this,

00:25:24.367 --> 00:25:27.740 align:middle line:84%
especially with theories
where it's not a free scalar

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.740 align:middle line:84%
field where you can't
decompose them like this--

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:30.610 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Right.

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:33.110 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: --by being expressed
in terms of ladder operators?

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:34.570 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:37.180 align:middle line:84%
So just heuristically,
you can imagine-- say, you

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.970 align:middle line:90%
can imagine these correlations.

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:44.020 align:middle line:84%
So, say, you make measurements
at different points.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And you study some kind of
joint amplitude of them.

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.135 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this is one way
to interpret this quantity.

00:25:50.135 --> 00:25:51.760 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Like, the
value of the field?

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:52.635 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:25:52.635 --> 00:25:55.510 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you imagine
they are spin operators.

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And say, phi denotes
some kind of spin,

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:00.850 align:middle line:84%
and then you can
imagine you measure them

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:02.650 align:middle line:90%
at different space time points.

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And you look for
their correlations.

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:06.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this is
the one example.

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.390 align:middle line:90%
But later, we will see--

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:13.300 align:middle line:84%
we will actually almost
see immediately-- yeah,

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.212 align:middle line:84%
just today, I think
we will reach there.

00:26:16.212 --> 00:26:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And you will see this actually
is related to the scattering

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:21.550 align:middle line:84%
amplitudes when we talk
about interacting series.

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:24.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.210 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:29.630 align:middle line:90%


00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:30.910 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:32.710 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:38.290 align:middle line:84%
So try to enjoy the
problem 3 in your Pset.

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And after doing it, really
read the problem again, OK?

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:46.645 align:middle line:90%
Read the problem again.

00:26:46.645 --> 00:26:50.785 align:middle line:84%
That problem contains
the things which--

00:26:50.785 --> 00:26:56.710 align:middle line:84%
yeah, just the simplest
situation for the divergences

00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:59.230 align:middle line:84%
you will see in
quantum field theory.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And to be prepared
for that is important.

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, even though
we will not directly

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:10.900 align:middle line:84%
use the result of the problem
3 in the immediate future,

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.660 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's important
as part of your education

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:17.650 align:middle line:84%
to get used to the infinities
and the divergences

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:19.030 align:middle line:90%
in quantum field theory.

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:21.580 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.140 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:24.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:28.150 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So I guess over here,
everything on the left hand

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:30.790 align:middle line:84%
side is, in terms of
these Green's functions,

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:32.530 align:middle line:84%
which could have been
solved classically

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:34.690 align:middle line:90%
without doing any quantization.

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:38.220 align:middle line:84%
So is there a reason
why the correlator

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.840 align:middle line:84%
and the quantized
field theory is

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.540 align:middle line:84%
the same as the correlator
in the the classical?

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.650 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, just
because it's a very simple--

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:46.980 align:middle line:90%
this is a very simple theory.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:47.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:48.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but even in this
case, it's actually--

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:54.300 align:middle line:84%
yeah, it depends on how
you interpret the behavior

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.580 align:middle line:90%
of those functions.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Even though this form,
you might say, oh, maybe

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:03.530 align:middle line:90%
we could anticipate this.

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Say, if you have a, say,
Gaussian statistical system,

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.480 align:middle line:90%
you will anticipate this.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Just say you only have
Gaussian fluctuations--

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:14.460 align:middle line:84%
you only have Gaussian
correlations and nothing else.

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.920 align:middle line:84%
But the specific form
of the functions, they

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.750 align:middle line:90%
do encode the quantum physics.

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And even though this
factorized form is like in--

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:27.196 align:middle line:84%
yeah, say, like in the
Gaussian statistical theory.

00:28:27.196 --> 00:28:27.696 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:27.696 --> 00:28:30.600 align:middle line:90%


00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:39.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, so so far, we discussed
the simplest free theory, just

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:42.430 align:middle line:84%
the theory of free
scalar particles.

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:44.620 align:middle line:90%
They don't have spin.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:49.480 align:middle line:84%
They have spin 0, so they don't
have any space-time component.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And they have some mass,
relativistic particles.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And later, we will talk about
electrons, which have spin 1/2,

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:00.850 align:middle line:84%
and talk about photons,
which have spin 1.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And before talking about
them, let's talk a little bit

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.620 align:middle line:90%
about interactions.

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Because so far, this theory
is absolutely boring.

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:14.470 align:middle line:84%
So even though this theory
illustrates this very important

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:18.250 align:middle line:84%
conceptual point that somehow
when you quantize the fields

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:19.510 align:middle line:90%
you can get particles.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:21.580 align:middle line:84%
OK, you can get arbitrary
number of particles.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:25.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's a connection between
the field and the particles.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.400 align:middle line:84%
But just in terms of
theory of particles,

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.320 align:middle line:84%
this series is
absolutely boring.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.630 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing-- the
particles don't do anything.

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:36.730 align:middle line:84%
They just go straight,
which is Newton's First Law.

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:38.860 align:middle line:84%
They just go straight
like Newton's First Law.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And so now, let's try to add
a little bit fun to introduce

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:47.650 align:middle line:90%
a little bit interactions.

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And you will see that
when you introduce

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:53.840 align:middle line:84%
a little bit interactions,
the story becomes much richer.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.290 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's talk
about interactions.

00:29:57.290 --> 00:30:10.100 align:middle line:90%


00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.870 align:middle line:84%
It turns out to
describe interactions,

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:17.810 align:middle line:84%
a very powerful approach
is the path integral.

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:21.340 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we will also
discuss the path integral.

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:25.970 align:middle line:84%
So we will use the path
integral approach to describe

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:29.180 align:middle line:90%
how to treat interactions.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, so first,
let's just say

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:42.265 align:middle line:84%
a few words about some general
remark on interacting theories.

00:30:42.265 --> 00:30:49.450 align:middle line:90%


00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:52.805 align:middle line:84%
So previously, we
consider theories

00:30:52.805 --> 00:30:54.805 align:middle line:84%
with a Lagrangian density
of the following form.

00:30:54.805 --> 00:31:00.970 align:middle line:90%


00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And we find it's
a free particle.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a theory of free particles.

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And now, we can easily
make this theory

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:11.820 align:middle line:84%
to be of interacting
particles if we just

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:15.000 align:middle line:90%
add some higher order powers.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.300 align:middle line:84%
So for example, one
of the simplest power

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.352 align:middle line:90%
is phi to the power of 4.

00:31:22.352 --> 00:31:26.410 align:middle line:90%


00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, you can also add
phi to the power of 3,

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:38.620 align:middle line:84%
but phi to the power of
3 is a little bit sick.

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:45.860 align:middle line:84%
It's because the phi cubed
doesn't have a definite sign.

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:50.405 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a definite
sign, and so phi cubed, say,

00:31:50.405 --> 00:31:52.460 align:middle line:84%
does not have a
well defined energy.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.440 align:middle line:84%
So your energy can go
arbitrarily negative.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
simplest interacting theory

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:00.620 align:middle line:90%
with a well defined energy.

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:03.650 align:middle line:90%


00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:11.200 align:middle line:84%
So we will write this as
L0, which is the free theory

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.690 align:middle line:84%
part, which we can see there,
and then the interacting part,

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:15.190 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:20.480 align:middle line:84%
This lambda
factorial, phi fourth.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And so this lambda, essentially
heuristic, this lambda

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:28.170 align:middle line:84%
should characterize the
importance of this term.

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So if lambda goes
to 0, of course,

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:31.670 align:middle line:84%
then this term goes
away, and then this term

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:32.810 align:middle line:90%
is not important.

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And when lambda becomes
bigger, then this term

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.480 align:middle line:90%
becomes more and more important.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And so we call the lambda
to be the coupling, which

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:42.440 align:middle line:84%
characterizes the
importance of this term.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:49.740 align:middle line:90%


00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So now, first,
let's follow what we

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:56.790 align:middle line:84%
were doing before for the
general quantization procedure.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:59.950 align:middle line:84%
We tried to write down the
classical equation of motion,

00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:01.800 align:middle line:84%
and then we
quantized-- and then we

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.890 align:middle line:84%
solved the most general
classical equations,

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:07.740 align:middle line:84%
the most general solutions
for the classical equations.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And then we promote those
solutions to operators, right?

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so let's try
to do this one.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:22.498 align:middle line:90%


00:33:22.498 --> 00:33:24.665 align:middle line:84%
So now, when you write down
the equation of motion--

00:33:24.665 --> 00:33:30.237 align:middle line:90%


00:33:30.237 --> 00:33:31.945 align:middle line:84%
so the equation of
motion is very simple.

00:33:31.945 --> 00:33:34.640 align:middle line:90%


00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:39.280 align:middle line:84%
You just get partial
square phi, m square phi.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.500 align:middle line:90%
So this is the free theory part.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And now, you have a
nonlinear part, the cube, OK?

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:51.337 align:middle line:90%


00:33:51.337 --> 00:33:52.920 align:middle line:84%
So now, you have a
nonlinear equation.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:59.840 align:middle line:90%


00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.265 align:middle line:90%
So who can solve this equation?

00:34:01.265 --> 00:34:06.130 align:middle line:90%


00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:07.270 align:middle line:90%
Any volunteers?

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:11.469 align:middle line:90%


00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:13.270 align:middle line:84%
It turns out actually
this equation,

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:16.250 align:middle line:84%
nobody has been able
to solve it so far.

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:18.940 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know
how to solve it.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And so our previous
strategy, even though

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.770 align:middle line:84%
sounds very powerful and
immediately it breaks down, OK?

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:31.449 align:middle line:84%
Because rely on you can
actually find the solutions

00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:34.000 align:middle line:90%
to this equation of motion.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, so we don't
know how to solve this.

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:53.159 align:middle line:90%


00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:56.420 align:middle line:84%
But heuristically,
you can imagine

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.970 align:middle line:84%
that this, indeed, should
be a theory of interacting

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:00.910 align:middle line:90%
particles.

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:03.388 align:middle line:84%
Because previously, when
you don't have this term,

00:35:03.388 --> 00:35:04.930 align:middle line:84%
you just have a
linear equation, then

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:06.980 align:middle line:90%
the phi is not doing anything.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, you have
a phi cubed term.

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:11.800 align:middle line:84%
So that means that the different
phis can now doing something

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.580 align:middle line:90%
together, OK?

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.340 align:middle line:84%
So when different phi's
doing something together,

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.350 align:middle line:84%
by definition, that's
called interactions.

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:19.510 align:middle line:84%
OK, and that's
called interactions.

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And so just heuristically,
this should already--

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:26.405 align:middle line:84%
this should give you a theory
of interacting particles.

00:35:26.405 --> 00:35:26.905 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:26.905 --> 00:35:35.400 align:middle line:90%


00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.850 align:middle line:84%
So we will talk about how
to treat such a theory.

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Since this cannot
be solved exactly,

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.730 align:middle line:84%
we can only try to
solve it approximately.

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So the only way we know how to
solve it approximately so far

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:51.680 align:middle line:84%
is to imagine the
lambda is small.

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.198 align:middle line:84%
And then you just expand
the lambda perturbatively.

00:35:54.198 --> 00:35:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Just treat the lambda
as a small parameter,

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:57.700 align:middle line:90%
you just expand the lambda.

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I will outline this
procedure in a little bit.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.820 align:middle line:84%
But before that, let me just
make some general remarks,

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:08.675 align:middle line:84%
which apply to general
interacting theories, which

00:36:08.675 --> 00:36:10.050 align:middle line:84%
this is just one
of the examples.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:14.260 align:middle line:90%


00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:20.470 align:middle line:84%
So actually figuring out
interactions from experiments--

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:26.120 align:middle line:84%
it's actually one of the main
tasks of the particle physics

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:29.910 align:middle line:84%
and many areas of
condensed matter physics.

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:36.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, and so for example,
we build LHC at CERN

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:41.420 align:middle line:84%
and you collide these protons
together, billions of dollars.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.390 align:middle line:84%
The whole purpose is to
figure out the interactions

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:46.520 align:middle line:90%
between the particles.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Between the elementary particles
and to verify them, et cetera.

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, with many
condensed matter experiments.

00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:59.940 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'll ask you
a simple question.

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.930 align:middle line:84%
So what's the most powerful
way, experimentally,

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:06.920 align:middle line:84%
to probe the interactions
between particles?

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.130 align:middle line:84%
What is the word to describe
that kind of experiment?

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:14.660 align:middle line:90%


00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:16.035 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:37:16.035 --> 00:37:16.910 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Scattering.

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:19.963 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, scattering.

00:37:19.963 --> 00:37:21.380 align:middle line:84%
So you should
already have learned

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:23.540 align:middle line:90%
this in quantum mechanics.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:28.280 align:middle line:84%
So scattering is
the key thing, OK?

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:37.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's essentially
the universal approach

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:41.770 align:middle line:84%
we have been using for more
than 100 years, starting

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:48.520 align:middle line:84%
from Rutherford, who first
shoot the helium atom at the--

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:53.600 align:middle line:84%
who first shooting electrons
at the helium atom.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.240 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.020 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no, no.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Shoot the alpha
particles at the--

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:00.350 align:middle line:90%
alpha particles at atoms.

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And so the scattering-- and
then, so you have Rutherford,

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:15.790 align:middle line:84%
and then you have the so-called
deep inelastic scattering, DIS,

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:18.280 align:middle line:84%
which you figured out
that the proton actually

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:22.900 align:middle line:84%
has substructure, which leads
to the discovery of quarks.

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And actually, MIT played a key
role, Friedman and Kendall,

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:32.710 align:middle line:84%
in the DIS experiment, which
figured out the structure--

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:37.900 align:middle line:84%
which discovered that
the quarks were--

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:42.980 align:middle line:84%
yeah, they played
the key role in that.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:49.540 align:middle line:84%
So and still, many, many
interactions and the particles

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:51.880 align:middle line:90%
were discovered this way.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:39:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And so the basic
idea of scattering--

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:06.170 align:middle line:90%


00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:07.735 align:middle line:84%
so essentially,
it's very simple.

00:39:07.735 --> 00:39:10.280 align:middle line:90%


00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:23.220 align:middle line:84%
You just collide a
bunch of particles, OK?

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.660 align:middle line:90%
And just examine the outcome.

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:34.520 align:middle line:90%


00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, so from the outcome,
you try to deduce

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:39.560 align:middle line:84%
what are the interactions
between those particles?

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:42.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's what
the experiment--

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:44.570 align:middle line:90%
scattering experiment about.

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:50.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, so from here, you deduce the
interaction, which has always

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:53.040 align:middle line:90%
been very successful.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:57.350 align:middle line:84%
So in condensed matter, you have
neutron scattering, et cetera.

00:39:57.350 --> 00:40:00.110 align:middle line:84%
X-ray, you can use
X-ray and the neutrons

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:02.135 align:middle line:90%
to shine on your samples.

00:40:02.135 --> 00:40:04.830 align:middle line:90%


00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
important observables

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:14.200 align:middle line:84%
for the scattering
experiment is what?

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.943 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is a simple
question of quantum mechanics.

00:40:16.943 --> 00:40:17.735 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Momentum?

00:40:17.735 --> 00:40:18.398 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Hmm?

00:40:18.398 --> 00:40:20.240 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Momentum?

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.267 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:40:21.267 --> 00:40:22.338 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Momentum?

00:40:22.338 --> 00:40:23.838 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: No,
momentum is not that--

00:40:23.838 --> 00:40:25.152 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: And cross section.

00:40:25.152 --> 00:40:26.030 align:middle line:90%
Cross section.

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.120 align:middle line:90%


00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.495 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Cross
section is close,

00:40:27.495 --> 00:40:30.573 align:middle line:90%
but there's a more fancy word.

00:40:30.573 --> 00:40:31.448 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:31.448 --> 00:40:33.840 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Hmm?

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.680 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Differential
cross section?

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:40.890 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: That's fancier,
but not fancy enough.

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:41.765 align:middle line:90%
It's called S-matrix.

00:40:41.765 --> 00:40:46.310 align:middle line:90%


00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:47.810 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: No, I
said S-matrix, but I

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:48.740 align:middle line:90%
didn't say it loud enough.

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:49.448 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Oh, OK.

00:40:49.448 --> 00:40:50.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, just be brave.

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.090 align:middle line:90%
Be braver next time.

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:58.440 align:middle line:90%


00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.520 align:middle line:90%
So one of the key elements--

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:07.910 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so one of the key
observables for scattering

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:09.680 align:middle line:90%
is a so-called the S-matrix.

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:18.190 align:middle line:84%
OK, to define S-matrix,
we need a little bit

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:23.980 align:middle line:84%
of mathematical idealization,
just as always in physics.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.160 align:middle line:84%
So the mathematical
idealization,

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.980 align:middle line:84%
in order to define
S-matrix, is the following.

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:36.770 align:middle line:90%


00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:42.780 align:middle line:84%
So at t equal to infinity,
t equal to minus infinity,

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:47.775 align:middle line:90%
prepare initial state--

00:41:47.775 --> 00:41:56.750 align:middle line:90%


00:41:56.750 --> 00:42:06.200 align:middle line:84%
yeah, initial state may be the
initial state as localized,

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:13.105 align:middle line:84%
say, wave packet
infinitely far apart.

00:42:13.105 --> 00:42:20.290 align:middle line:90%


00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:23.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is the mathematical
idealization part, OK?

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.245 align:middle line:84%
We want them to be
infinitely far apart.

00:42:25.245 --> 00:42:32.260 align:middle line:90%


00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:34.120 align:middle line:90%
But you aim them, OK?

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:38.050 align:middle line:84%
So you prepare them spatially
infinitely far apart,

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:41.470 align:middle line:84%
but you aim of them-- you
prepare their initial momentum

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:43.780 align:middle line:84%
so that they can come
together at some point.

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:46.020 align:middle line:90%
You aim them.

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And then they will come
together at some point,

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:50.610 align:middle line:90%
and then they will scatter.

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:53.190 align:middle line:84%
They will interact
with each other.

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And then they will form
some final product,

00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:01.290 align:middle line:84%
and then the final product will
then run away from each other,

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:01.950 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:03.820 align:middle line:84%
They will have
velocity momentum.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:04.920 align:middle line:90%
They will run away.

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.720 align:middle line:90%
And then you just wait.

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Wait until the
products are far apart,

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:11.160 align:middle line:90%
then you match with them.

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:15.300 align:middle line:84%
So mathematically, this is
called t equals infinity--

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.760 align:middle line:84%
yeah, of course, t equal
to plus-minus infinity

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:20.550 align:middle line:84%
is also a mathematical
idealization.

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And the final particles
are also far apart.

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:32.250 align:middle line:90%
Again, infinitely far apart.

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Because they are all
relativistic particles and they

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.450 align:middle line:90%
all move.

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And even with slightly
momentum difference,

00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:44.810 align:middle line:90%
eventually, they will be--

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:47.570 align:middle line:84%
if you wait long enough
time, then they will be--

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:51.120 align:middle line:90%


00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.740 align:middle line:84%
so this final path
are very important,

00:43:53.740 --> 00:44:11.050 align:middle line:84%
these two, because this means
we can neglect the interactions.

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:17.770 align:middle line:90%


00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:22.856 align:middle line:84%
OK, as t goes to
plus-minus infinity.

00:44:22.856 --> 00:44:27.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, so with this set
up, and then t equals

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:31.200 align:middle line:84%
plus-minus infinity,
they are very far away.

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And then you can neglect
the interactions.

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:33.630 align:middle line:90%
This is important.

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Then we can identify
each particle,

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:36.720 align:middle line:84%
because when they
are together, they

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:39.420 align:middle line:84%
all interacting with
each other, it's

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:41.730 align:middle line:84%
not easy to cleanly
identify each particles

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:43.710 align:middle line:90%
and discuss their properties.

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And so now, we can
neglect the interactions.

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:56.620 align:middle line:90%


00:44:56.620 --> 00:45:15.990 align:middle line:84%
So the initial and final
states, and then a collection

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:17.160 align:middle line:90%
of free particles.

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:24.890 align:middle line:90%


00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:26.615 align:middle line:84%
And they can be
described by free theory.

00:45:26.615 --> 00:45:35.050 align:middle line:90%


00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:38.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is very important
because remember,

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:41.290 align:middle line:84%
we cannot solve this kind of
interacting theory exactly.

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:44.040 align:middle line:90%


00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So now, but we can reliably
almost to infinitely accuracy

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:53.640 align:middle line:84%
if you talk about the initial
state and the final state.

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And we can talk about
them as precisely

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:59.820 align:middle line:84%
as we can, as far as we go to
t going to plus-minus infinity.

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:00.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:04.503 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So how do you know
adding a phi to the fourth term

00:46:04.503 --> 00:46:05.420 align:middle line:90%
leads to interactions?

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:08.035 align:middle line:84%
Just because its the simplest
term that [INAUDIBLE]..

00:46:08.035 --> 00:46:09.520 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah,
just in principle,

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:14.100 align:middle line:84%
any nonlinear term will
lead to interactions.

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the intuition
is that anything

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:19.680 align:middle line:84%
beyond the linear level, you
will have different phi's

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:20.620 align:middle line:90%
coming together.

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:24.870 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's phi cubed,
or phi four, so higher powers

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:26.940 align:middle line:90%
or exponentials.

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:30.108 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just anything
which is not linear phi's

00:46:30.108 --> 00:46:31.650 align:middle line:84%
have to do something
with each other,

00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:33.690 align:middle line:90%
and that just means interaction.

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:34.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:34.635 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:46:34.635 --> 00:46:36.427 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Why are you
doing the interaction

00:46:36.427 --> 00:46:40.950 align:middle line:84%
from the minus one half m
squared phi squared term?

00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:43.383 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry, say it again.

00:46:43.383 --> 00:46:44.300 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: So we have--

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:45.550 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this does not
give you interactions

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:48.530 align:middle line:90%
because this just--

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:52.130 align:middle line:84%
remember, when you do equation
of motion, that still gives you

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:52.880 align:middle line:90%
a linear term.

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:53.300 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:54.510 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Linear term
just give you a mass.

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:54.790 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:55.873 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah yeah, yeah.

00:46:55.873 --> 00:46:56.840 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, in the Lagrangian, the
quadratic term, a free term.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.210 align:middle line:84%
So since above
the quadratic term

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:06.380 align:middle line:90%
gives you the interactions.

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:07.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:09.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:09.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:11.607 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: If I know what
the interaction potential is

00:47:11.607 --> 00:47:14.240 align:middle line:84%
to the particles, like gluon
or something like that, how

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.425 align:middle line:90%
can I translate that into--

00:47:15.425 --> 00:47:16.550 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:19.250 align:middle line:90%
Here you can not translate.

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Here, I'm just giving you the
intuition that somehow when

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:23.810 align:middle line:84%
you add such kind
of nonlinear term

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:26.510 align:middle line:84%
that should lead to some
kind of interactions.

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:29.720 align:middle line:84%
But to understand what
precisely kind of interactions,

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.643 align:middle line:84%
you have to look at
physical observables.

00:47:31.643 --> 00:47:33.560 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we need
to look at the S-matrix.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Even for this theory,
we want to say, suppose

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:41.000 align:middle line:84%
we have this theory,
but in real life,

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.550 align:middle line:84%
how do we see in
the real experiment?

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, if this theory
can be realized

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:51.500 align:middle line:84%
in the real experiment,
what it looks like?

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to see it
is through this S-matrix.

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:55.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:47:55.340 --> 00:48:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And so this S-matrix, and
then yeah, we can deduce back.

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:00.520 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:05.470 align:middle line:90%


00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:06.510 align:middle line:90%
OK, good?

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:09.810 align:middle line:84%
So this is important
because this makes sure

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:14.790 align:middle line:84%
that even when we're unable
to solve the theory exactly,

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:18.510 align:middle line:84%
we can still talk about initial
and final state exactly.

00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:19.780 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:23.770 align:middle line:84%
At least we can define
our problem precisely.

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:26.530 align:middle line:84%
So let's denote the
collection of initial particle

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:31.010 align:middle line:84%
to be alpha, the momentum
of initial particles.

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:32.540 align:middle line:84%
So essentially,
this characterizes

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:35.780 align:middle line:90%
your initial state.

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:38.472 align:middle line:84%
And because here we're talking
about scalar particles.

00:48:38.472 --> 00:48:40.055 align:middle line:84%
They don't have spin,
so the momentum,

00:48:40.055 --> 00:48:43.100 align:middle line:90%
they are only quantum numbers.

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And say I use beta to
describe their final momentum.

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:51.530 align:middle line:90%
I call them p 1 prime, say p n.

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:53.780 align:middle line:84%
So the initial
number of particles

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and final number of particles
don't have to be the same.

00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And then the scattering
process is just

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:03.350 align:middle line:90%
to go from alpha to beta.

00:49:03.350 --> 00:49:06.200 align:middle line:84%
OK, you start a bunch of
particles at t equal to

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:08.120 align:middle line:84%
minus infinity with
those momentum,

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:11.780 align:middle line:84%
and then at t plus infinity,
you observe some other particles

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:13.400 align:middle line:90%
with those momentum, OK?

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And then we want to
understand the transition

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:16.860 align:middle line:90%
amplitude between them.

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:19.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the
experiment matches.

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And from here, of course,
you get the cross section,

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:23.682 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:49:23.682 --> 00:49:25.265 align:middle line:84%
But this is a more
fundamental object.

00:49:25.265 --> 00:49:33.520 align:middle line:90%


00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.680 align:middle line:90%
So to write this precisely--

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:48.810 align:middle line:90%


00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:50.850 align:middle line:84%
so essentially, we
are looking at, say,

00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:56.800 align:middle line:84%
in the Heisenberg picture,
this is my final state.

00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And I look at the evolution
from minus infinity

00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:05.200 align:middle line:84%
to plus infinity, start
from initial state alpha.

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:10.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
evolution operator

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:14.310 align:middle line:90%
of your quantum system.

00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes, we also
write this as the-- so this

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:20.190 align:middle line:90%
is in the Schrodinger picture.

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And in the Heisenberg
picture, we write it as this.

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:26.220 align:middle line:90%


00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:29.790 align:middle line:84%
So now, this means that this is
the state defined at the minus

00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:31.920 align:middle line:84%
infinity, this is
the state that's

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.557 align:middle line:90%
defined as plus infinity.

00:50:33.557 --> 00:50:35.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is the notation
in the Heisenberg picture.

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is the notation
in the Schrodinger picture.

00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:45.855 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this object
we often denote.

00:50:45.855 --> 00:50:48.420 align:middle line:90%


00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:50.070 align:middle line:90%
So you can worry--

00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:51.930 align:middle line:84%
you can run alpha
and the beta over all

00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:55.320 align:middle line:84%
possible initial states and
all possible final states.

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And then that
forms a big matrix,

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:00.930 align:middle line:84%
in fact infinite
times infinite matrix.

00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:02.790 align:middle line:90%
And so this is our S-matrix.

00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:06.160 align:middle line:90%


00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:09.850 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, all your
secret of interactions

00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:12.350 align:middle line:90%
are encoded in here.

00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:15.040 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Why is it an
infinite dimensional matrix?

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.540 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah,
because you can--

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:21.640 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so you have a value
for any choice of alpha

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:22.990 align:middle line:90%
and the beta, right?

00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And so any choice of alpha and
the beta is one matrix element.

00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:30.463 align:middle line:84%
But you have infinite possible
choice of initial momentum.

00:51:30.463 --> 00:51:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can have an
arbitrary number of particles,

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:34.460 align:middle line:84%
you can have a
arbitrary momentum.

00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:37.585 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, in principle,
for the final state.

00:51:37.585 --> 00:51:38.085 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:38.085 --> 00:51:41.058 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: And all this
is one kind of particle?

00:51:41.058 --> 00:51:41.850 align:middle line:90%
Or how do you know?

00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:42.475 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:51:42.475 --> 00:51:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, here, for this
particular problem,

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.570 align:middle line:90%
it's one kind of particle.

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:47.072 align:middle line:84%
But this definition
is very general.

00:51:47.072 --> 00:51:48.280 align:middle line:90%
This is a very good question.

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:51.550 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter whether you
have one kind of particle,

00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:54.780 align:middle line:84%
two kinds of particle, even an
infinite number of particles.

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:55.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:57.520 align:middle line:84%
An infinite species
of particles.

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:00.540 align:middle line:84%
So here, even for one
kind the particle,

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:02.970 align:middle line:84%
I have infinite possible
choices because I

00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:05.580 align:middle line:84%
have infinite possible choice
of all those momentums.

00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:09.240 align:middle line:84%
I can choose k equal to
1, 2, 3, to infinity.

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And also, the value of
those k can all change.

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:13.010 align:middle line:90%
P can change.

00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:13.670 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:15.587 align:middle line:84%
So this is the infinite
times infinite matrix.

00:52:15.587 --> 00:52:20.440 align:middle line:90%


00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:25.212 align:middle line:90%
OK, so essentially, this S--

00:52:25.212 --> 00:52:26.920 align:middle line:84%
this is essentially
just a matrix element

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:29.598 align:middle line:90%
of this evolution operator.

00:52:29.598 --> 00:52:31.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, essentially, this
is the matrix element

00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:32.473 align:middle line:90%
of the evolution operator.

00:52:32.473 --> 00:52:36.010 align:middle line:84%
You can see it from here
explicitly from minus infinity

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:36.910 align:middle line:90%
to plus infinity.

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:42.190 align:middle line:90%
OK, good?

00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:45.450 align:middle line:90%


00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:48.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's convenient--
so let me just

00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:55.020 align:middle line:84%
say a few things
about the S-matrix.

00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:58.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's convenient-- so when
the interaction is weak--

00:52:58.290 --> 00:53:06.940 align:middle line:90%


00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:10.708 align:middle line:84%
so when the interaction
is weak, you can imagine,

00:53:10.708 --> 00:53:12.500 align:middle line:84%
most of the time, the
particles, they don't

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:15.740 align:middle line:90%
interact with each other, OK?

00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:18.590 align:middle line:84%
So when you do the
scattering, you

00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:20.400 align:middle line:84%
put a bunch of
particles scattering--

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.160 align:middle line:84%
if the interaction
is very weak, then

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:26.660 align:middle line:84%
they don't actually
interact very much.

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:32.590 align:middle line:84%
So we expect-- so when
the S equals to identity,

00:53:32.590 --> 00:53:35.340 align:middle line:84%
then that means there's
no interaction at all.

00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:39.100 align:middle line:84%
OK, for free theory, it
will be just the identity.

00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you're seeing
that the interaction is weak,

00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:43.720 align:middle line:84%
and then it's convenient,
we write the S-matrix

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:48.940 align:middle line:84%
in the following form, i T, and
this includes the interaction

00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:49.540 align:middle line:90%
part.

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:54.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, captures interacting effect.

00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:59.475 align:middle line:90%


00:53:59.475 --> 00:53:59.975 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:53:59.975 --> 00:54:06.790 align:middle line:90%


00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:08.270 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And by definition-- yeah,
any questions on this?

00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:14.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:17.194 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So I was interpreting
the elements of the S-matrix

00:54:17.194 --> 00:54:19.294 align:middle line:84%
as sort of the
probability to end up

00:54:19.294 --> 00:54:21.270 align:middle line:84%
in a certain state
from the initial state.

00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.895 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:54:21.895 --> 00:54:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, S-matrix is the
amplitude, the probability

00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:26.580 align:middle line:90%
you have to square it.

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:27.090 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:27.715 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:54:27.715 --> 00:54:30.030 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: But then
why does it make sense

00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:33.132 align:middle line:84%
that if it's a weak
interaction, that it would--

00:54:33.132 --> 00:54:35.510 align:middle line:84%
like, as the limit
goes to no interaction,

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:38.140 align:middle line:84%
the S-matrix would be
normal at the identity?

00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:39.390 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry, say it again.

00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:41.640 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So why do we see
that for weak interactions,

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:42.410 align:middle line:90%
it's the identity?

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:44.160 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, if
there's no interaction,

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.150 align:middle line:90%
it will be identity.

00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:46.775 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: But why
does that make sense?

00:54:46.775 --> 00:54:48.780 align:middle line:84%
Because that's just
saying the amplitude

00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:52.140 align:middle line:84%
is 1 to end up in
a certain state?

00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:54.420 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, just
you always go back to--

00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:57.390 align:middle line:90%
the state does not change.

00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:59.310 align:middle line:90%
What it means is that--

00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:00.910 align:middle line:90%
it means delta alpha beta.

00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:02.317 align:middle line:84%
Because alpha must
equal to beta.

00:55:02.317 --> 00:55:03.150 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:03.650 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:07.530 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, what it means
is just delta alpha beta, right?

00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:09.255 align:middle line:84%
So it means the
alpha equals to beta.

00:55:09.255 --> 00:55:09.963 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:55:09.963 --> 00:55:11.760 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:12.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.840 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is S a
Hermitian Matrix?

00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:16.760 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, we
will talk about that.

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:18.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not Hermitian it's unitary.

00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:19.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:19.817 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:55:19.817 --> 00:55:21.650 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Does the phase
of the entries in S

00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:23.320 align:middle line:90%
carry any physical consequences?

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.210 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, that's
a good question.

00:55:25.210 --> 00:55:28.120 align:middle line:90%


00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you can see the particular
amplitude when you square it,

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:32.560 align:middle line:90%
of course, the phase don't.

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:35.200 align:middle line:84%
But in principle, you can
design the different--

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:38.487 align:middle line:84%
you can design experiments
in the different things they

00:55:38.487 --> 00:55:39.070 align:middle line:90%
can interfere.

00:55:39.070 --> 00:55:39.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so in principle, they
contain physical information.

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:43.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:48.010 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Why is
this entry complex?

00:55:48.010 --> 00:55:49.260 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Or just convenience.

00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:49.818 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:55:49.818 --> 00:55:51.360 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, just
for convenience.

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:51.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:54.160 align:middle line:90%


00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:58.300 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, if alpha was a
particle at minus x infinity,

00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:04.790 align:middle line:84%
beta was the same particle
at plus x infinity?

00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:06.580 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry, say it again.

00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:09.360 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: If my alpha to
beta was just particle here

00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.825 align:middle line:84%
goes to particle there, is
that captured by S equals 1?

00:56:11.825 --> 00:56:12.450 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:13.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:13.772 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:56:13.772 --> 00:56:16.380 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Just say
in the free theory,

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:19.380 align:middle line:84%
if you start with a bunch
of particles at p 1 and p k

00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:23.230 align:middle line:84%
then you end with the
same p 1 p k Yeah.

00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:23.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:23.730 --> 00:56:26.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:28.960 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:33.030 align:middle line:90%
So due to translation symmetry--

00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:37.250 align:middle line:84%
so we expect energy
momentum conservation.

00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:50.090 align:middle line:90%


00:56:50.090 --> 00:56:52.340 align:middle line:84%
OK, so yeah, so
this, if you write it

00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:57.570 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
component rotation,

00:56:57.570 --> 00:57:02.690 align:middle line:84%
so this is delta beta
alpha plus i T beta alpha.

00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:05.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, and i just
purely convention.

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:07.820 align:middle line:84%
i is purely convention,
just for convenience.

00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:12.930 align:middle line:90%


00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:14.970 align:middle line:84%
So due to the momentum
conservation--

00:57:14.970 --> 00:57:17.830 align:middle line:90%


00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:20.530 align:middle line:84%
so this corresponding
to the interaction part.

00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:23.310 align:middle line:84%
So in this part, we expect
alpha not equal to beta

00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:26.230 align:middle line:90%
because you have interactions.

00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:28.270 align:middle line:84%
But the total momentum
must be conserved.

00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:33.550 align:middle line:84%
So the sum of here must
be the sum of here.

00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Just the total momentum
must be conserved.

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:41.720 align:middle line:84%
So that means this scene
must contain a delta function

00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:43.670 align:middle line:84%
between the total
initial momentum

00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:46.970 align:middle line:90%
and the total final momentum.

00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:50.345 align:middle line:84%
And so we can just
convenient to extract--

00:57:50.345 --> 00:57:53.047 align:middle line:90%


00:57:53.047 --> 00:57:54.380 align:middle line:90%
to separate that delta function.

00:57:54.380 --> 00:58:08.460 align:middle line:84%
OK, so convenient to write
i T beta alpha equal to i,

00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:10.340 align:middle line:84%
you separate out
this delta function.

00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Because we know the delta
function must be there,

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:15.500 align:middle line:90%
so p alpha minus p beta.

00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:18.950 align:middle line:84%
So p alpha and p beta
means total momentum

00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:20.060 align:middle line:90%
for alpha and the beta.

00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:23.630 align:middle line:90%
And then, you have M alpha beta.

00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:25.310 align:middle line:90%
So this is the nontrivial part.

00:58:25.310 --> 00:58:26.850 align:middle line:90%
So this part is trivial.

00:58:26.850 --> 00:58:28.700 align:middle line:90%
You expect from kinematics.

00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And so this M alpha
beta is called

00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:32.720 align:middle line:90%
the scattering amplitude.

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:42.770 align:middle line:90%


00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:51.795 align:middle line:84%
So now some properties of the
S-matrix because you see that

00:58:51.795 --> 00:58:56.070 align:middle line:84%
S-matrix is essentially
just a matrix element--

00:58:56.070 --> 00:59:00.160 align:middle line:84%
essentially just the
matrix of the U. And the U

00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:04.250 align:middle line:84%
is a unitary matrix, because
it's a evolution operator.

00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:18.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that means that the
S-matrix is unitary since U--

00:59:18.370 --> 00:59:24.010 align:middle line:84%
this is a unitary
operator, so that means

00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:29.060 align:middle line:90%
that S is a unitary matrix.

00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:35.820 align:middle line:90%


00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:38.430 align:middle line:90%
Also, you can show--

00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:41.520 align:middle line:84%
somebody be running out
of time because today,

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:43.740 align:middle line:90%
we have to end at 5:40.

00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And so for any symmetry
of the Hamiltonian--

00:59:48.090 --> 00:59:57.172 align:middle line:90%


00:59:57.172 --> 01:00:02.670 align:middle line:84%
for any symmetry
of the Hamiltonian,

01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:06.360 align:middle line:84%
that means that if
you have some Q--

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:10.140 align:middle line:84%
yeah, if you have some,
say, unitary operator, which

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:11.625 align:middle line:90%
commutes with the Hamiltonian.

01:00:11.625 --> 01:00:14.940 align:middle line:90%


01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:19.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, so remember
all the symmetries,

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:25.190 align:middle line:84%
the interaction are generated
by unitary operators.

01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:28.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, so suppose we have
some unitary, which

01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:29.500 align:middle line:90%
commutes with the Hamiltonian.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:36.040 align:middle line:90%


01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Then, you can easily
show yourself--

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:43.650 align:middle line:84%
so I'll leave this
exercise to yourself.

01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:52.200 align:middle line:84%
So lambda is a unitary operator
generating some symmetries.

01:00:52.200 --> 01:01:01.457 align:middle line:90%


01:01:01.457 --> 01:01:03.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, so for example, for
the Lorentz transformation

01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:05.340 align:middle line:84%
would be like this
e to the i omega

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:09.540 align:middle line:84%
M, which you have
done in your homework.

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:12.465 align:middle line:90%
And then it will satisfy--

01:01:12.465 --> 01:01:17.070 align:middle line:90%


01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:19.830 align:middle line:84%
then when you act initial
state and the final state

01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:27.380 align:middle line:84%
by this lambda, and then the
matrix should be the same.

01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:30.560 align:middle line:84%
So you can easily prove
this by using the commute.

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:32.290 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:32.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:34.408 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is another
equivalent way

01:01:34.408 --> 01:01:37.390 align:middle line:84%
of saying that like S
and lambda also commute?

01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:40.848 align:middle line:90%


01:01:40.848 --> 01:01:41.390 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: No.

01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.950 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:47.230 align:middle line:90%
No, they don't.

01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:48.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:01:48.730 --> 01:01:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's the
statement, right?

01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:52.730 align:middle line:90%
This is a statement.

01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:54.290 align:middle line:90%
So as S-matrix element.

01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:55.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:55.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:59.502 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's a statement that
the lambda commute with U.

01:01:59.502 --> 01:02:00.210 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK, OK.

01:02:00.210 --> 01:02:02.020 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, lambda
commute with U and S

01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:03.760 align:middle line:90%
is the matrix element of U.

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:04.480 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK, OK.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:04.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:05.795 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:05.795 --> 01:02:08.290 align:middle line:90%


01:02:08.290 --> 01:02:12.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is the key
object we want to calculate

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.690 align:middle line:90%
in the interacting theory.

01:02:13.690 --> 01:02:16.220 align:middle line:90%


01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:20.000 align:middle line:90%
So now, without proof--

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.890 align:middle line:84%
because the proof requires
something going beyond what

01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:26.820 align:middle line:90%
we discussed so far.

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:34.640 align:middle line:84%
So let me just code
this LSZ theorem, which

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:40.300 align:middle line:84%
said that the M alpha beta,
this scattering amplitude,

01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:40.975 align:middle line:90%
can be obtained.

01:02:40.975 --> 01:02:46.740 align:middle line:90%


01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:49.920 align:middle line:84%
So we will discuss how
you obtain in nature

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:57.470 align:middle line:84%
from such correlation functions,
time-ordered correlation

01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:58.220 align:middle line:90%
functions.

01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:02.670 align:middle line:90%


01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So this omega is the vacuum for
the full interaction theory.

01:03:08.270 --> 01:03:10.770 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this is the vacuum.

01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:13.070 align:middle line:84%
So I write omega
to distinguish it

01:03:13.070 --> 01:03:17.130 align:middle line:84%
from 0, which is the free
theory we discussed earlier.

01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And this time-ordering means
that you order the operator

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.180 align:middle line:90%
according to their time.

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So whichever time is
bigger sits earlier, OK?

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.050 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
object, key object,

01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:33.450 align:middle line:84%
if you want to calculate
the M alpha beta.

01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And you have to calculate
this object first.

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:40.510 align:middle line:90%
OK, and so I will stop here.

01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And so next time, we
will say a few more words

01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:49.620 align:middle line:84%
about how the general approach
to treat this kind of theory,

01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:52.890 align:middle line:84%
and then we will start talking
about the path integral.

01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:57.100 align:middle line:84%
So have people studied
the path integral before?

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:59.453 align:middle line:84%
So you are a expert of
path integral or not quite?

01:03:59.453 --> 01:04:00.870 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Expert
is a strong word.

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:02.070 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I know
we've heard of it.

01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:02.640 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: OK.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I will review
the path integral of--

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:10.770 align:middle line:90%
yeah, I will actually--

01:04:10.770 --> 01:04:13.830 align:middle line:84%
so I will actually introduce
the path integral from scratch,

01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:18.400 align:middle line:84%
but I will do it a little bit
faster than ordinary quantum

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.390 align:middle line:90%
mechanical class.

01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And even for people who
have not seen it before,

01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:24.340 align:middle line:84%
I think you should
be able to follow

01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:26.290 align:middle line:84%
with a little bit of
effort after the class.

01:04:26.290 --> 01:04:26.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:28.140 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Good point.

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:32.000 align:middle line:90%
