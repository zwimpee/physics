00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.520 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Let us start.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.900 align:middle line:84%
First, I forgot to mention
last time I will always

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.280 align:middle line:84%
use the metric convention
for Minkowski spacetime

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.630 align:middle line:90%
to be given by this one.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.940 align:middle line:90%
So the time component--

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.260 align:middle line:90%
I have minus 1.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.785 align:middle line:84%
And then the spatial
component is positive 1.

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:34.530 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.610 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.790 align:middle line:84%
So also, let me just
first remind you

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.480 align:middle line:90%
what we did in last lecture.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So in the last
lecture, we talked

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:52.330 align:middle line:84%
about the principle of locality,
which is a powerful principle.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And so this naturally leads
to the concept of fields.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.380 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I will generally
denote fields--

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.060 align:middle line:84%
say, using this
kind of notation.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and when we talk
about fields abstractly,

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:84%
we will use this
kind of location.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And so phi_a is just a
label for different fields.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And also-- so the fields
depend on spatial coordinates

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.958 align:middle line:90%
and also depend on time.

00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.250 align:middle line:84%
So the field coordinate--
you can think of this spatial

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.600 align:middle line:84%
dependence as the
label for the fields--

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.930 align:middle line:90%
for the degrees of freedom.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.650 align:middle line:84%
So at each spatial point,
the degrees of freedom--

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and the time describe
its evolution.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.780 align:middle line:90%
So essentially, this is like--

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.740 align:middle line:84%
so classical field is like
classical mechanics degrees

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.133 align:middle line:84%
of freedom but now with
the infinite number

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:49.050 align:middle line:90%
of degrees of freedom.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.550 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:84%
So the classical field theory
is like classical mechanics

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:84%
but now with infinite number
of degrees of freedom.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Because now you have some
finite number degrees of freedom

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:90%
for each point in spacetime.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.050 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.030 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And the principle
locality also implies

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.710 align:middle line:84%
that the action for such
dynamical variables--

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.760 align:middle line:84%
so the fields are our
dynamical variables--

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.570 align:middle line:84%
and also implies that the
action has a local form.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:28.380 align:middle line:90%


00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So the action have the form that
is always a single spacetime

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.310 align:middle line:84%
integral and some
function, which

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.370 align:middle line:84%
is called Lagrangian
density, which

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.720 align:middle line:90%
is a function of the fields--

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.890 align:middle line:84%
say, phi at some point
at the point x, which--

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.470 align:middle line:90%
and then also its derivatives.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.980 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And so because of
locality, then the action

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.010 align:middle line:90%
has a very simple form.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And then, as in
classical mechanics,

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.410 align:middle line:84%
you can introduce
canonical momentum,

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.860 align:middle line:84%
conjugate to your
dynamical variable.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.450 align:middle line:90%
So we have momentum density.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.730 align:middle line:84%
So you conjugate to
phi a each point.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:27.440 align:middle line:90%


00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.510 align:middle line:84%
So this is the phi dot, which
is the time derivative of phi.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And then you can also introduce
the Hamiltonian density,

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.800 align:middle line:90%
which is the pi a phi dot a.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So a is summed and
then minus L. OK?

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And then the
Hamiltonian is obtained

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.900 align:middle line:90%
by integrating this over space.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.540 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And also, the
equation of motion--

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.210 align:middle line:84%
when you do the
variation of the action

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.710 align:middle line:84%
and you find the
equation of motion,

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.470 align:middle line:84%
it's given by the
following general form.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:16.940 align:middle line:90%


00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:17.440 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.490 align:middle line:84%
So the equation of motion is
given by this general form.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And when we study field
theory, as we study, say,

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.600 align:middle line:84%
any other subject, we always
start with simplistic examples.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.150 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.366 align:middle line:84%
And the simplest example would
be, say, a single scalar field,

00:04:36.366 --> 00:04:45.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, if you can see the
single scalar field, which

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.290 align:middle line:90%
you have low index.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.100 align:middle line:84%
We just have phi, which now
depends on spacetime point x.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And then the simplest action
for such a scalar field--

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:01.810 align:middle line:84%
you can just write down based
on a general principle-- say--

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.310 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:90%
So you kind of have this form.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.400 align:middle line:84%
So we discussed last time the
simplest action for scalar

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.770 align:middle line:90%
field have the following form--

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.980 align:middle line:84%
partial mu phi, partial
mu phi, and then

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.710 align:middle line:90%
plus m-squared phi-squared.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And then the sign here
is determined because

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.600 align:middle line:90%
of the metric convention.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.060 align:middle line:84%
So this is the simplest scalar
field theory we can write down.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.560 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.240 align:middle line:84%
So here, I have written
here a quadratic function

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.300 align:middle line:84%
for phi, which we wrote as a
general function last time.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And here, the kinetic term
comes from the Lorentz symmetry.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.060 align:middle line:84%
So this is the simplest
derivative term

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.490 align:middle line:84%
you can write down which
respect Lorentz symmetry.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.600 align:middle line:84%
You can have more
complicated terms.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.860 align:middle line:84%
You can have this term,
for example, squared.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.360 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.818 align:middle line:84%
But that would be
more complicated.

00:05:57.818 --> 00:06:01.980 align:middle line:90%
So this is the simplest one.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And so this will be
the simplest field

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.000 align:middle line:90%
theory we will study first.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.690 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.300 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.776 align:middle line:84%
So in this case,
for this example,

00:06:13.776 --> 00:06:21.810 align:middle line:84%
the momentum density
just equal to phi dot--

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.550 align:middle line:90%
just time derivative of phi.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And then the
equation of motion is

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.180 align:middle line:90%
given by a linear equation phi.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.160 align:middle line:90%
It's given by that.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.550 align:middle line:90%


00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.380 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very simple theory
with very simple equation

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.600 align:middle line:90%
of motion.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.950 align:middle line:90%
But later, we will see--

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:46.570 align:middle line:84%
I actually will teach us a lot
about general field theory.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very quick summary
of some of the main points

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.790 align:middle line:90%
of last lecture.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.230 align:middle line:90%
Do you have any questions?

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:03.950 align:middle line:90%


00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:04.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.950 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: You haven't
specified if phi a is

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.320 align:middle line:90%
either complex or real.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.550 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Right.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle line:90%
So phi here is a real field.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.190 align:middle line:90%
So phi just take a real value.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:16.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.810 align:middle line:90%


00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:20.800 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.330 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.280 align:middle line:90%


00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.770 align:middle line:84%
So now we will talk about
the second topic related

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:47.210 align:middle line:84%
to our discussion of classical
field theory, the symmetries

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.140 align:middle line:90%
and conservation laws.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:57.660 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.970 align:middle line:84%
So when we have a theory,
say, with such an action,

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.910 align:middle line:84%
we say the theory
has a symmetry.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:10.960 align:middle line:84%
So the definition of the
symmetry is the following.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:21.090 align:middle line:84%
So symmetry is
some transformation

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:28.700 align:middle line:84%
of each field phi a into,
say, some function of phi.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:37.970 align:middle line:84%
So this new phi a can, say,
depend on all possible fields.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:38.799 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And so some transformation
of your dynamical variables--

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.380 align:middle line:84%
so here, prime just means
a different function,

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.180 align:middle line:84%
it does not mean
derivatives, OK--

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:55.146 align:middle line:84%
which leaves the
action invariant.

00:08:55.146 --> 00:09:01.950 align:middle line:90%


00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.590 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:12.220 align:middle line:84%
So whenever happens-- and
we say this is a symmetry.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:19.050 align:middle line:84%
So for example, in
this example, OK--

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:23.460 align:middle line:90%


00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.350 align:middle line:84%
let me give you a
label to this equation.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.230 align:middle line:90%
Let me call this equation star.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:39.180 align:middle line:84%
So in the example of star,
say, for example, the symmetry

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.090 align:middle line:90%
includes, say, translation.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:50.520 align:middle line:90%


00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.020 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:58.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you imagine we take
a coordinate transformation

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:05.265 align:middle line:84%
and we do a shift in
coordinates, a constant shift--

00:10:05.265 --> 00:10:07.630 align:middle line:90%


00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:08.130 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's imagine we do a constant
shift of the coordinates.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.430 align:middle line:90%
And a mu is a constant.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.100 align:middle line:90%
So a mu are constants.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:22.930 align:middle line:90%


00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:23.650 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:25.850 align:middle line:90%
So it's a constant vector.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And now if we assume
that the phi transform

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:29.900 align:middle line:90%
as the following--

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.450 align:middle line:84%
so when you change
the coordinates,

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.910 align:middle line:84%
it essentially just
changes the label.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:34.660 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:38.050 align:middle line:84%
It changes the
label on the fields.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:41.780 align:middle line:84%
But the value of the
field should not change.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:47.220 align:middle line:84%
So that means that the phi
evaluated at the original point

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.760 align:middle line:90%
should be the same.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.290 align:middle line:84%
So that means the new
transform of the phi evaluated

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.780 align:middle line:90%
at the new point, OK--

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.360 align:middle line:84%
new x prime point-- should
be the same as the value

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.960 align:middle line:90%
at the original point.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.460 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.340 align:middle line:90%
So this is the--

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:02.850 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.260 align:middle line:84%
So suppose the phi
transform like this.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So the scalar field
should transform

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:20.500 align:middle line:90%
like this under a general--

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.310 align:middle line:84%
so this is the example of a
spacetime transformation, OK,

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and the general
spacetime transformation.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:36.390 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:38.220 align:middle line:90%
as, say, this equation.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.270 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.720 align:middle line:90%
So you change the label.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.920 align:middle line:84%
But the value of phi
should not change.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.420 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So the new phi evaluated
at the new location

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.530 align:middle line:84%
should be the same
as the value of phi

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.670 align:middle line:90%
at the original location.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.260 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And so you can easily
check it yourself.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:59.050 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.550 align:middle line:84%
So you can easily
check it yourself.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.140 align:middle line:90%
But I will not do it here.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.980 align:middle line:84%
So this exercise for yourself--
that actually this action

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:10.270 align:middle line:84%
is invariant under
this transformation

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.510 align:middle line:90%
with this change of x.

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:15.885 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:15.885 --> 00:12:17.320 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.810 align:middle line:90%


00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:25.800 align:middle line:84%
So second transformation--
which this is invariant--

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.570 align:middle line:90%
is a Lorentz symmetry.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:32.660 align:middle line:90%


00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.700 align:middle line:84%
So Lorentz transformation
is another kind

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.670 align:middle line:84%
of spacetime transformation
on the spacetime coordinates.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:48.870 align:middle line:84%
If you take x mu to x mu prime,
you go to lambda mu nu x nu.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:57.170 align:middle line:84%
So lambda mu nu is the constant
Lorentz transformation matrix.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:57.670 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:01.440 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:01.940 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.940 align:middle line:84%
It's the constant Lorentz
transformation matrix.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And again, under such a
coordinate transformation,

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.140 align:middle line:90%
phi--

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.200 align:middle line:90%
will transform this way.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.890 align:middle line:90%
Phi should transform this way.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And now you can
check it yourself,

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.830 align:middle line:84%
OK-- and because
of this contraction

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.270 align:middle line:90%
of partial mu, partial mu.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And then this is
actually a symmetry.

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:22.850 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is left as
an exercise for yourself.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.425 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I think
in your Pset problem,

00:13:28.425 --> 00:13:29.675 align:middle line:90%
you will do something similar.

00:13:29.675 --> 00:13:33.520 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.555 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:13:34.555 --> 00:13:39.555 align:middle line:90%


00:13:39.555 --> 00:13:40.055 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:13:40.055 --> 00:13:43.140 align:middle line:90%


00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:48.780 align:middle line:84%
So examples like this kind of
transformation for translation

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.590 align:middle line:84%
and then for Lorentz
transformation--

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:56.040 align:middle line:84%
so this is what we call
the continuous symmetries.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.210 align:middle line:90%
So continuous symmetries--

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:12.460 align:middle line:90%


00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:12.960 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.440 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
transformations--

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.360 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I should also give
a label to this equation.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.050 align:middle line:84%
So let me call it
just star-star-star.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:27.060 align:middle line:84%
So-- [LIGHT CHUCKLE]----
continuous symmetries are

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:35.850 align:middle line:84%
transformations,
like star-star-star,

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:46.620 align:middle line:90%
involving continuous parameters.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:51.470 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.690 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:53.690 --> 00:15:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And so both one and the two are
clearly continuous symmetries.

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:13.800 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they are
continuous symmetries.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:20.680 align:middle line:90%


00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So you can easily
see from here--

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.905 align:middle line:84%
so here, the
transformation is a.

00:15:25.905 --> 00:15:27.080 align:middle line:90%
And a is four numbers.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.580 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:28.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a vector.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:29.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a four vector.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And a can be
arbitrarily changed.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.040 align:middle line:90%
So it's a continuous parameter.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:33.540 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.160 align:middle line:90%
You can take it to be 0.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.860 align:middle line:84%
You can take it to be 0.1 in
all directions, et cetera.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's something that can
be continuously changed.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, the
Lorentz transformation

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.550 align:middle line:90%
contains continuous parameters.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.860 align:middle line:84%
So do you remember how
many continuous parameters

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:55.120 align:middle line:84%
does the Lorentz transformation
contain in four dimensions?

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:55.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:56.777 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: 16.

00:15:56.777 --> 00:15:57.360 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Hmm?

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.598 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: 16.

00:15:59.598 --> 00:16:00.140 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: No.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.350 align:middle line:90%
[LIGHT CHUCKLE] Yes?

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:03.140 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Six.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.970 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, six.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.250 align:middle line:84%
It's because you
have three rotations.

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Because you have three
spatial directions,

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.960 align:middle line:90%
you have three rotations.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And then you also
have three posts--

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.560 align:middle line:90%
yeah, so altogether six.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So here, there's six
continuous parameters.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:23.940 align:middle line:90%


00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.140 align:middle line:90%
And here, there's a 4.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:26.640 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.540 align:middle line:90%
So here is 4.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.490 align:middle line:84%
So both are
continuous symmetries.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:31.750 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And in contrast, this
Lagrangian have--

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.890 align:middle line:84%
this action has
a lot of symmetry

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:42.740 align:middle line:90%
which is not continuous.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Can you say what
that symmetry is?

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.840 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.310 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:54.440 align:middle line:90%
Priority is a good answer.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.890 align:middle line:84%
But there's still
something slightly simpler.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:16:59.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:09.509 align:middle line:90%


00:17:09.509 --> 00:17:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So notice that here, it's
all quadratic in phi.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.050 align:middle line:90%
And what do you observe?

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:21.589 align:middle line:90%


00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:24.500 align:middle line:90%
So here, there is symmetry.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:29.120 align:middle line:90%
A lot of the symmetry is phi.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.785 align:middle line:84%
It goes to minus phi, OK,
because it is quadratic in phi.

00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And also, of course,
there's a symmetry

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:40.560 align:middle line:84%
called a parity, which in the
case of x goes to minus x.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.260 align:middle line:84%
So the spatial direction
x goes to minus x.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And then phi, again,
transforms as this.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:45.840 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you can also check--
this is also a symmetry.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.290 align:middle line:84%
So in both of these
cases, they don't

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:53.670 align:middle line:90%
involve continuous parameters.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And so these are called
discrete symmetries.

00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.310 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.810 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So there's no
continuous parameters.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.940 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.930 align:middle line:84%
In this case, both of
them are called Z2.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And this Z2 means that if you
do the transformation once,

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.930 align:middle line:90%
it goes back to the identity.

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:15.430 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:18.087 align:middle line:90%
So here, if you do the twice--

00:18:18.087 --> 00:18:19.920 align:middle line:84%
yeah, if you do it
twice, it goes back to --

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.450 align:middle line:84%
if you do it twice, it
goes back to identity.

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:22.325 align:middle line:90%
And this is the same.

00:18:22.325 --> 00:18:23.620 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.550 align:middle line:90%
So here is a Z2 transformation.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Also, symmetries
can be separated

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:37.370 align:middle line:84%
into continuous symmetry or
discrete symmetries depending

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:40.730 align:middle line:84%
on whether you have
continuous parameters or not.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.770 align:middle line:84%
But symmetries can
also be separated

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:46.870 align:middle line:84%
into other different--
there's another classification

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:48.250 align:middle line:90%
of the symmetry.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:53.760 align:middle line:84%
It's called the gauge symmetry
and the global symmetries.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.460 align:middle line:90%
So there are global symmetries--

00:18:55.460 --> 00:19:01.760 align:middle line:90%


00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:12.830 align:middle line:84%
corresponding to the
transformation parameters

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.210 align:middle line:90%
are spacetime independent.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:25.140 align:middle line:90%


00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:25.650 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:30.810 align:middle line:84%
So both of these are
examples of global symmetries

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:32.340 align:middle line:90%
because they are just constant.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:32.840 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.100 align:middle line:84%
They don't-- a mu don't
depend on spacetime.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And the lambda don't
depend on spacetime.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:38.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And you can also have local
symmetries, in which case

00:19:49.470 --> 00:20:03.570 align:middle line:84%
the transformation parameters
are spacetime dependent.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:04.070 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:13.280 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:17.320 align:middle line:84%
So an example of the local
transformation which you may

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:24.130 align:middle line:84%
remember is the so-called gauge
transformation in E&M. So E&M,

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:25.780 align:middle line:90%
you can--

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.190 align:middle line:90%
yeah, anyway.

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:28.910 align:middle line:84%
So later, we will
see an example.

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:30.610 align:middle line:90%
We will go back to E&M again.

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And you will see examples
of this local symmetry.

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:37.710 align:middle line:90%


00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.150 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:40.953 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:20:40.953 --> 00:20:42.370 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So if
the transformation

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:44.980 align:middle line:84%
changes the action but doesn't
change the equations of motion,

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.815 align:middle line:90%
is that still a symmetry?

00:20:46.815 --> 00:20:47.440 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, phi deals
with the action--

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.950 align:middle line:84%
yeah, that's a
very good question.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:58.270 align:middle line:84%
So by definition, if it
leave the action invariant,

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:00.010 align:middle line:90%
we say it's a symmetry.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And in general--
actually, almost always,

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.385 align:middle line:84%
if it leaves the
action invariant,

00:21:04.385 --> 00:21:06.760 align:middle line:84%
actually it also leaves the
equation of motion invariant.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, but it's not guaranteed.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Just purely from a
mathematical point of view,

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.460 align:middle line:90%
it's not guaranteed.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:18.370 align:middle line:84%
But for all physical examples,
it's almost always the same.

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:19.360 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.840 align:middle line:90%


00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.260 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:32.820 align:middle line:90%
And now there's a very simple--

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:37.800 align:middle line:84%
it's simple but a very deep
connection between the symmetry

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.750 align:middle line:90%
and the conservation laws.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:45.020 align:middle line:84%
So that you may have
already learned it in--

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:48.330 align:middle line:84%
yeah, actually I forgot
when I learned it myself.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:51.580 align:middle line:84%
So some of may have
learned it in high school.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.066 align:middle line:84%
Some of you may have learned
it in 8.01, et cetera.

00:21:54.066 --> 00:21:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so there's a
connection between the symmetry

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.330 align:middle line:90%
and the conservation laws.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And so any conservation
laws can be understood

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.950 align:middle line:90%
as a consequence of symmetry.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So in classical mechanics,
you may remember

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.980 align:middle line:90%
that the time translation--

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:17.920 align:middle line:90%


00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.930 align:middle line:84%
this leads to
energy conservation.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:26.390 align:middle line:90%


00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And the spatial
translation symmetry

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.095 align:middle line:84%
then leads to the
momentum conservation.

00:22:35.095 --> 00:22:40.320 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a
rotational symmetry,

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.589 align:middle line:84%
it then leads to the angular
momentum conservation.

00:22:50.589 --> 00:22:59.880 align:middle line:90%


00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.900 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.350 align:middle line:84%
So this should be something
you already know, say,

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:08.400 align:middle line:90%
from your classical mechanics.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.740 align:middle line:84%
But in classical field theory,
this can be generalized.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:12.270 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So here, there's the
Noether theorem--

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:23.075 align:middle line:84%
so first discovered by Emmy
Noether, the Noether theorem.

00:23:23.075 --> 00:23:26.170 align:middle line:90%


00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:41.400 align:middle line:84%
She said any continuous
global symmetry

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.898 align:middle line:90%
leads to conservation laws.

00:23:42.898 --> 00:23:43.398 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:43.398 --> 00:23:49.720 align:middle line:90%


00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.530 align:middle line:90%
It leads to a conservation.

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And so no matter what
kind of symmetry, OK--

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:84%
in addition to those things
we are familiar with,

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.500 align:middle line:84%
but no matter what kind
of symmetry-- but any time

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:07.480 align:middle line:84%
you have a continuous global
symmetry in your system, then

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.560 align:middle line:90%
you have conserved.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.030 align:middle line:90%
You have conservation.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:11.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So now let me give a proof
of this Noether theorem.

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:18.210 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:20.168 align:middle line:84%
So before I prove it, do
you have any questions

00:24:20.168 --> 00:24:21.300 align:middle line:90%
regarding its statement?

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:25.050 align:middle line:90%


00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:26.166 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:24:26.166 --> 00:24:29.910 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So what's
the definition of--

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:31.400 align:middle line:84%
so you said a
continuous symmetry

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.488 align:middle line:84%
is one that depends
continuously on a parameter.

00:24:33.488 --> 00:24:35.030 align:middle line:84%
But if you wanted
to write out, like,

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:38.300 align:middle line:84%
equation star-star-star in a way
that specializes to continuous

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.630 align:middle line:84%
symmetry, is there
a way to do that--

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:45.118 align:middle line:84%
to show just how to check if
something is a continuous--

00:24:45.118 --> 00:24:46.160 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:50.295 align:middle line:84%
You just check whether there's
a continuous parameter.

00:24:50.295 --> 00:24:52.420 align:middle line:84%
You just check whether
there is a parameter or not.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.860 align:middle line:90%


00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:55.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:25:00.590 align:middle line:90%


00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:03.730 align:middle line:90%
Does this answer your question?

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:04.408 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:04.408 --> 00:25:06.700 align:middle line:84%
Normally, you can just see
whether there's a parameter.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:06.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:07.720 align:middle line:90%
[LIGHT CHUCKLE]

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.940 align:middle line:84%
If you write down the
transformation explicitly,

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.170 align:middle line:90%
you will be able to just see.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:13.810 align:middle line:84%
If we go over here, there's
no transformation parameter.

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:14.950 align:middle line:90%
You can just see.

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And then there, for the Lorentz
transformation and translation,

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:21.570 align:middle line:90%
you can just see it explicitly.

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:23.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:31.620 align:middle line:84%
So an important aspect
of a continuous symmetry

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.790 align:middle line:84%
is that, because you have
a continuous parameter--

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:38.060 align:middle line:84%
so you can continuously
relate it to identity.

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:41.810 align:middle line:84%
So trivial
transformation-- you just

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:43.100 align:middle line:90%
don't transform at all, right?

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.450 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, the
a mu is equal to 0.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And so in this case, the
trivial transformation-- just

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.500 align:middle line:84%
the lambda mu nu-- is
the identity matrix.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
imagine a slightly--

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:56.146 align:middle line:90%


00:25:56.146 --> 00:25:59.620 align:middle line:84%
a thinning on the
infinitesimal rotation

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.270 align:middle line:90%
or infinitesimal boost.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And then that's corresponding
to a so-called infinitesimal

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:05.020 align:middle line:90%
transformation.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:05.540 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.230 align:middle line:84%
So here, you can also just
translate a mu a little bit,

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.990 align:middle line:84%
OK-- so very close
to the identity.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:13.195 align:middle line:90%
And so essentially, for any--

00:26:13.195 --> 00:26:16.710 align:middle line:90%


00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:17.210 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So for any global
continuous symmetry,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.575 align:middle line:90%
it has an infinitesimal form.

00:26:33.575 --> 00:26:46.590 align:middle line:90%


00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:47.090 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:50.510 align:middle line:84%
It's just when your
transformation parameter

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:55.190 align:middle line:84%
is very close to the identity,
OK, very close to the 0.

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And so for example, for
a general transformation

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:02.820 align:middle line:84%
like this, if the transformation
is close to the identity,

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:06.180 align:middle line:84%
then we can always write
it in the following form--

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:14.420 align:middle line:84%
phi a goes to phi a prime, which
is equal to phi a, and with

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:18.330 align:middle line:84%
some parameter-- small
parameter epsilon--

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:20.100 align:middle line:90%
and some function-- f_a--

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.330 align:middle line:84%
and then, say, phi b, OK,
and the derivative of phi

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:25.544 align:middle line:90%
b, et cetera.

00:27:25.544 --> 00:27:26.044 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:26.044 --> 00:27:31.540 align:middle line:84%
So this epsilon is the
infinitesimal transformation

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:32.230 align:middle line:90%
parameter.

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:38.710 align:middle line:90%


00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:39.210 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
continuous symmetry,

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:47.670 align:middle line:84%
there's always, say, an
infinitesimal transformation

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:50.510 align:middle line:90%
which are close to the identity.

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:55.510 align:middle line:84%
So this epsilon corresponding
to this case for a mu

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.530 align:middle line:90%
is very small.

00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:59.827 align:middle line:84%
Or for the Lorentz
transformation case

00:27:59.827 --> 00:28:01.910 align:middle line:84%
corresponding to rotation
angle, it's very small--

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:03.710 align:middle line:90%
or the boost is very small.

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:05.060 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:05.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.690 align:middle line:84%
So the epsilon can be
any of those parameters.

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:10.240 align:middle line:90%


00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And then this f, it can be
some arbitrary function.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:13.860 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.850 align:middle line:84%
So this f can be some arbitrary
functions of your fields.

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:17.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:23.090 align:middle line:90%


00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:23.750 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:30.290 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, yeah,
the data phi, OK--

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:32.490 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so the symmetry
transformation--

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:36.650 align:middle line:84%
so we'll use the
rotation delta-hat phi a.

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:41.435 align:middle line:84%
So this symmetry was then
given by the epsilon f a OK?

00:28:41.435 --> 00:28:44.190 align:middle line:90%


00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:49.710 align:middle line:84%
So delta-hat here implies
an infinitesimal symmetry

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.660 align:middle line:90%
transformation.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:52.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:56.710 align:middle line:90%


00:28:56.710 --> 00:29:03.250 align:middle line:84%
So now let's consider
during a variation of S

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:12.090 align:middle line:84%
under this delta-hat, OK, since
by definition of the symmetry--

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:18.330 align:middle line:84%
because this is a symmetry, that
means that delta-hat S should

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:21.120 align:middle line:90%
be equal to 0.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.410 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Because of the
variation of the action,

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:29.900 align:middle line:84%
it should be invariant
under the symmetry.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And so now let's look at
what's the consequence of it.

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:38.810 align:middle line:84%
So now we can just
vary this L. Then the--

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:43.805 align:middle line:84%
so this means that the
variation of the L,

00:29:43.805 --> 00:29:51.510 align:middle line:84%
the Lagrangian density, must
be a total derivative, OK,

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:54.570 align:middle line:84%
since every transformation
is proportional to--

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:55.680 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.815 align:middle line:90%
So epsilon is a small parameter.

00:29:57.815 --> 00:29:59.190 align:middle line:84%
So when we do the
transformation,

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:04.850 align:middle line:84%
we only need to keep track
in the order in epsilon.

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And so the
transformation of the L

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:08.880 align:middle line:84%
must also be
proportional to epsilon.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.560 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.590 align:middle line:84%
So since this must
be invariant, that

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:17.380 align:middle line:84%
means the variation of the L
must be a total derivative.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.660 align:middle line:90%
So k mu would be just some--

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.910 align:middle line:90%
so for some k mu.

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:22.990 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:23.740 align:middle line:90%
For some k mu.

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.600 align:middle line:90%
So there must exist some k mu.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And then this k
mu can also be 0.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.940 align:middle line:84%
In that case, the Lagrangian
density is invariant.

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:31.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:33.350 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is delta-hat
the variation

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.790 align:middle line:90%
under your transformation?

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:35.540 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.220 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is delta-hat
the variation

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:40.250 align:middle line:90%
under the transformation?

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:44.520 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Delta-hat just
denotes such a transformation.

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.910 align:middle line:84%
It just denotes such
a transformation.

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:50.250 align:middle line:84%
This is not the
general variation.

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:51.380 align:middle line:90%
This is very specific.

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:54.820 align:middle line:84%
This is a symmetric
transformation.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And so under the
symmetric transformation,

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.240 align:middle line:84%
your action should be
invariant by definition

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.650 align:middle line:90%
because this is a symmetry.

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:03.180 align:middle line:90%
And that in turn--

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.390 align:middle line:84%
because the S is the
integration of L,

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:08.160 align:middle line:84%
then that means that
the transformation

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:12.510 align:middle line:84%
of L, the Lagrangian density,
must be a total derivative.

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And here, we keep
track of everything

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.920 align:middle line:90%
in the order in epsilon.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.395 align:middle line:84%
And so this must be
proportional to epsilon

00:31:19.395 --> 00:31:20.520 align:middle line:90%
times the total derivative.

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.020 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And so we must have this
structure, yeah, for some k mu,

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:38.010 align:middle line:84%
OK, which can be
0, which can be 0.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:39.510 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:40.320 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.920 align:middle line:84%
So now let's look at what's the
implications of this equation.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:44.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So this equation
is the constraint

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.860 align:middle line:90%
imposed by the symmetry.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:50.360 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Now let's look at
the implications

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:53.360 align:middle line:90%
of this constraint.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:56.270 align:middle line:90%


00:31:56.270 --> 00:32:01.080 align:middle line:84%
So now we can just do
the variation of L.

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Now we can just do the
variation of L. Yeah.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.405 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I will keep that equation.

00:32:10.405 --> 00:32:11.905 align:middle line:84%
And then I will do
this board first.

00:32:11.905 --> 00:32:25.140 align:middle line:90%


00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.432 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: So I have a question.

00:32:26.432 --> 00:32:26.940 align:middle line:90%
Does this problem--

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:27.810 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah?

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:32.970 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: --show if something
is a symmetry of your action

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:38.250 align:middle line:84%
for your system, would you
directly vary the thing--

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:40.630 align:middle line:84%
like, parameter and then
show that your action doesn't

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:41.130 align:middle line:90%
change?

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Or would you do that
infinitesimal form

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:48.488 align:middle line:90%
and then show that--

00:32:48.488 --> 00:32:49.530 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: So we want to--

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:49.785 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I don't know.

00:32:49.785 --> 00:32:50.040 align:middle line:90%
I was just--

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:50.820 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Right.

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:57.890 align:middle line:84%
So we want to use the fact
that such a transformation is

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:05.980 align:middle line:84%
a symmetry to derive what is the
constraint on the Lagrangian,

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.590 align:middle line:84%
OK, what is the
constraint on the theory.

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Say, we assume that somehow
the theory has a symmetry.

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And then we want to see
what is the constraint this

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:19.560 align:middle line:90%
put on your theory.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:20.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's right.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.470 align:middle line:84%
We are proving the
laws of the theorem.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:25.330 align:middle line:90%


00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:26.830 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:27.850 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:33.410 align:middle line:90%


00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:33.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:41.230 align:middle line:84%
So that equation is
the implication--

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:43.810 align:middle line:84%
is the constraint
imposed by the symmetry.

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And we want to see what
this equation tells us.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.530 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:47.530 --> 00:33:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And for this purpose, we
just do the variation.

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:55.140 align:middle line:90%
So the delta-hat L--

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.680 align:middle line:84%
so because L is just
a function of phi--

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:05.916 align:middle line:84%
and then we have partial L,
partial phi a, delta-hat phi a;

00:34:05.916 --> 00:34:10.710 align:middle line:84%
and then we have L,
partial-partial mu

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:17.060 align:middle line:84%
phi a; and then partial
mu delta-hat phi a.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:18.699 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:22.710 align:middle line:90%
So we just did the variation.

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:25.020 align:middle line:90%
And now-- OK?

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.375 align:middle line:90%
And so-- yeah.

00:34:27.375 --> 00:34:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And now we are going to
use the equation of motion.

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:30.000 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.150 align:middle line:90%
So from the equation of motion--

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:37.070 align:middle line:84%
I think I erased-- yeah, from
the equation of motion, then

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:39.230 align:middle line:84%
partial L, partial
phi a-- this is

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:46.460 align:middle line:84%
just equal to partial mu,
partial L, partial-partial mu

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:47.870 align:middle line:90%
phi a.

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:48.650 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:51.719 align:middle line:90%
So we just plug this into here.

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:54.230 align:middle line:84%
So when you plug this
into here, now you

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:57.950 align:middle line:84%
notice this becomes
a total derivative.

00:34:57.950 --> 00:35:00.460 align:middle line:90%


00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:00.960 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:15.350 align:middle line:84%
So you partial L, partial mu
phi a, and delta-hat phi a.

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:15.850 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So you find-- after using
the equation of motion,

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:22.450 align:middle line:84%
this variation of L have
the following form, which

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:23.982 align:middle line:90%
is the total derivative.

00:35:23.982 --> 00:35:26.700 align:middle line:90%


00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And this should be equal
to the right-hand side.

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.620 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:33.790 align:middle line:84%
It should be equal to
the right-hand side.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:34.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:36.750 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:38.520 align:middle line:90%
And then here we find--

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:43.300 align:middle line:84%
so this should be equal to
epsilon partial mu k mu.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:43.800 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.960 align:middle line:84%
So we combine both
sides together,

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:50.625 align:middle line:84%
plug in that this is
equal to epsilon times fa.

00:35:50.625 --> 00:36:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we conclude, OK,
partial mu, partial L,

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:12.740 align:middle line:84%
partial-partial mu phi a, and fa
minus k mu, we see equal to 0.

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.140 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So if we call this
J mu and then we

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.260 align:middle line:90%
have a conservation equation--

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:26.600 align:middle line:90%
partial mu J mu equal to 0.

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:27.100 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:28.350 align:middle line:90%
So we have a conservation law.

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:31.250 align:middle line:90%


00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.520 align:middle line:84%
So remember,
conservation law is just

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:40.852 align:middle line:84%
to have a vector which satisfies
this equation and then--

00:36:40.852 --> 00:36:43.820 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:46.618 align:middle line:84%
So more explicitly--
yeah, so the Jmu

00:36:46.618 --> 00:36:47.660 align:middle line:90%
is just this combination.

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:48.710 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:50.280 align:middle line:90%
Jmu is just this combination.

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.400 align:middle line:90%
So any questions on this?

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:55.400 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is this partially
with the shift in presence

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.300 align:middle line:84%
because it's the derivative
with respect to spacetime here,

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.890 align:middle line:84%
but if we have a
conservation law

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:02.940 align:middle line:84%
from the derivative
with respect to time

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.575 align:middle line:90%
equal to 0 but not space?

00:37:04.575 --> 00:37:05.450 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:06.670 align:middle line:90%
I will-- yeah.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this is the stronger
version than your normally--

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:11.390 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:13.820 align:middle line:84%
So this is the spacetime
version of the conservation

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:16.560 align:middle line:84%
law from your normally
classical mechanics.

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So this is a field
theory version of that.

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I will elaborate
that equation a little bit.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:25.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:32.570 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So if you only
transform the field, not the x

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:33.830 align:middle line:90%
and t for the--

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:35.090 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:37.160 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: --the
effect is to eliminate

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.940 align:middle line:84%
that derivative of your
operator for everything?

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.920 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.000 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Say it again?

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.450 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I mean, the
reason you include

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:50.180 align:middle line:84%
the derivative of the
field is because you

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:53.250 align:middle line:84%
are including the
effect of transforming

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:56.160 align:middle line:90%
the spacetime coordinates.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.110 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: So here--

00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:58.860 align:middle line:90%
yeah, yeah.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:02.107 align:middle line:84%
So here is a
general formulation.

00:38:02.107 --> 00:38:03.690 align:middle line:84%
So this transformation
can be general.

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:07.590 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be, say,
a spacetime transformation--

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:09.400 align:middle line:90%
we said earlier.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.780 align:middle line:84%
This is just some
abstract symmetry, just

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:16.438 align:middle line:90%
some arbitrary transformations.

00:38:16.438 --> 00:38:17.920 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:22.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you only go through
the symmetries that have

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:26.880 align:middle line:84%
changed in the field but not
the symmetries that haven't?

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.630 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, because
spacetime variable

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:29.590 align:middle line:90%
is a dummy variable.

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:33.850 align:middle line:84%
In the action, you can
always get rid of that.

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:38.780 align:middle line:84%
The x change-- x is just a
dummy variable in your action

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:41.820 align:middle line:90%
because you integrate over x.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:42.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:45.100 align:middle line:90%


00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:49.050 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So is it possible
to interpret higher order

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:53.925 align:middle line:84%
derivatives not
including that pathway?

00:38:53.925 --> 00:38:55.050 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:56.820 align:middle line:90%
This definitely include the--

00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:00.580 align:middle line:84%
normally-- yeah,
you can in principle

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:03.210 align:middle line:84%
have as many
derivatives as you want.

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:06.720 align:middle line:84%
But normally, if we have an
action which only contains

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.885 align:middle line:84%
first derivatives, then
your symmetry transformation

00:39:09.885 --> 00:39:12.950 align:middle line:84%
will only involve
first derivatives.

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:16.320 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So, though,
we're just not discussing

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:19.626 align:middle line:90%
the case of transforming--

00:39:19.626 --> 00:39:23.236 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:39:23.236 --> 00:39:23.895 align:middle line:90%
We're--

00:39:23.895 --> 00:39:25.020 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.370 align:middle line:90%
In principle, you can have it.

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:28.050 align:middle line:90%
In principle, you can have it.

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm just writing
this for simplicity.

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:30.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:35.500 align:middle line:90%


00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, good.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can ask after the
class, yeah, if it's not clear.

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:42.530 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:43.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.990 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:47.920 align:middle line:84%
So let me elaborate a
little bit on this equation.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:53.250 align:middle line:84%
So this equation you may have
seen in E&M, which you often

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:56.190 align:middle line:90%
call the continuity equation.

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:59.160 align:middle line:84%
If you write this
equation separately,

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.960 align:middle line:90%
it has the following form--

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:08.560 align:middle line:84%
partial 0 J0 plus partial
I, or the divergence

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.070 align:middle line:90%
of the spatial component.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:16.050 align:middle line:84%
So J mu-- if we write
it in terms of the--

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:18.615 align:middle line:84%
OK, explicitly, then
you have this form.

00:40:18.615 --> 00:40:21.390 align:middle line:90%


00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:25.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is so-called the
continuity equation-- just

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:29.650 align:middle line:84%
the time variation
of the density.

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:30.150 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:31.730 align:middle line:84%
The 0 component
that you consider

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:33.240 align:middle line:90%
as some kind of density--

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.640 align:middle line:84%
it's the same as the
divergence of the current.

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.110 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And in particular,
you can define

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:45.390 align:middle line:84%
a charge, which is the total
spatial integration of J0.

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:45.890 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:51.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you integrate both
sides over the total volume--

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and then this just
becomes partial 0 Q.

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And this term becomes
a total derivative.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And then you can convert
it into a boundary

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.780 align:middle line:90%
term using the Gauss's law.

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And then, normally, the
current vanishes at infinity.

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you just have
the charge conservation.

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.922 align:middle line:90%
You just have charge conversion.

00:41:15.922 --> 00:41:17.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.630 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:21.790 align:middle line:90%
So this is the field--

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:23.530 align:middle line:84%
so normally in
classical mechanics,

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:25.500 align:middle line:90%
you just have this equation.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:26.000 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is the field theory
version of your conservation.

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:31.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:35.420 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So is there a way
to maybe to know what it is

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:36.670 align:middle line:90%
and how we got it?

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:37.430 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:41.060 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is there a way to
calculate what J represents?

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:42.032 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: J represents?

00:41:42.032 --> 00:41:43.490 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
what it represents?

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:44.615 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:41:44.615 --> 00:41:48.540 align:middle line:84%
If I give you a specific-- yeah,
you will do it in your Pset.

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:52.240 align:middle line:84%
So if I give you a
specific Lagrangian--

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.570 align:middle line:84%
if you start a specific
transformation,

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:57.550 align:middle line:84%
and then you will be able to
find all those quantities--

00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:59.718 align:middle line:84%
you will be able to
find the k explicitly.

00:41:59.718 --> 00:42:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And you will be able to find
all those quantities explicitly.

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Then you can find the
J. Other questions?

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:14.130 align:middle line:90%


00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:15.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:19.080 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Minus delta L
of 0 implies that delta L

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.020 align:middle line:90%
needs to be over here.

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:20.687 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Right.

00:42:20.687 --> 00:42:24.970 align:middle line:90%
It's because if we have here--

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:28.330 align:middle line:84%
so here, if we have
delta s equal to 0--

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and then you can just
put the delta in.

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And then this quantity that
is integrated over that--

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:39.280 align:middle line:84%
if this is 0, then
this has to be

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:48.475 align:middle line:84%
a total derivative
Other questions?

00:42:48.475 --> 00:42:48.975 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:42:48.975 --> 00:42:52.150 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So what happens if
it's not a global symmetry?

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:54.050 align:middle line:90%
Where does this argument break?

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:55.580 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Right, yeah.

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:56.080 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:00.290 align:middle line:90%
This is a very good question.

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I will not have
time to go into here.

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Let me just very
quickly mention.

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So this is called the
first Noether theorem--

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:15.500 align:middle line:84%
and when epsilon is
spacetime independent.

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And so when epsilon is
not spacetime dependent,

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:20.780 align:middle line:84%
then the story is a little
bit more complicated.

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:25.500 align:middle line:84%
So the epsilon will be
inside this total derivative.

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.260 align:middle line:84%
You cannot take
it out, et cetera.

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And then the story
changes a little bit.

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And then there's something
called the second Noether

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:32.950 align:middle line:90%
theorem.

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And actually, in that case, when
you have local symmetries when

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:38.500 align:middle line:84%
epsilon depends on
spacetime, instead

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.570 align:middle line:84%
of finding
conservation laws, you

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:43.030 align:middle line:84%
find that your
equation of motion--

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:47.320 align:middle line:84%
not all-- you find some parts
of the equation of motion

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:49.210 align:middle line:90%
are redundant.

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:50.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:51.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you-- it's not difficult.
But actually, in principle, I

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:59.990 align:middle line:84%
can put it in the Pset
problem, if people really

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:01.100 align:middle line:90%
want to see it.

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:01.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:03.660 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So this is
something to think

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:07.200 align:middle line:84%
about the transformation,
the vicinity of the identity.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.720 align:middle line:84%
What happens to the information
of the transformation

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:10.530 align:middle line:90%
outside of--

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:11.910 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Good, good, good.

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:18.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is the beauty of
physics, which you may already

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:20.640 align:middle line:90%
have seen in quantum mechanics.

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So whenever we see a
symmetry, no matter how

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.660 align:middle line:90%
complicated that symmetry is--

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:29.500 align:middle line:90%
say, some continuous symmetry--

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:32.740 align:middle line:84%
it's enough just to
understand that symmetry

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:38.020 align:middle line:84%
near the identity, near to the
infinitesimal transformation.

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:40.510 align:middle line:84%
It's because any
finite transformation

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:43.960 align:middle line:84%
you can build up
from just adding up

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.620 align:middle line:84%
the infinitesimal
transformations.

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.703 align:middle line:84%
So once you know the
infinitesimal transformation,

00:44:47.703 --> 00:44:51.310 align:middle line:84%
actually, essentially up to
some global or topological

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:53.200 align:middle line:84%
structure, essentially
it determines

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.350 align:middle line:90%
the full finite transformation.

00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:58.058 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So we can
define transformation

00:44:58.058 --> 00:45:00.100 align:middle line:84%
by taking the derivative
of things that

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.070 align:middle line:90%
are different that obviously--

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:02.930 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: No, no.

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:04.560 align:middle line:90%
It's always a symmetry, right?

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:07.640 align:middle line:90%
Because each step is a cemetery.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.270 align:middle line:90%
And so you add them up.

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:12.573 align:middle line:84%
You add them up
still a symmetry.

00:45:12.573 --> 00:45:13.115 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:13.115 --> 00:45:15.442 align:middle line:84%
But a sequence of different
symmetries, for example?

00:45:15.442 --> 00:45:17.150 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Oh, if you
do different-- yeah,

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:20.180 align:middle line:90%
they're still a symmetry.

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because by definition
if something transforms

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.835 align:middle line:84%
that's invariant into
another transformation,

00:45:25.835 --> 00:45:27.050 align:middle line:90%
it's still invariant.

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:32.170 align:middle line:90%


00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:32.670 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:33.930 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:34.702 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:45:34.702 --> 00:45:36.285 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: For discrete
symmetry, where

00:45:36.285 --> 00:45:39.060 align:middle line:84%
we don't have this epsilon,
can we do something similar?

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:39.750 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:41.070 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: For
discrete symmetries--

00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:42.090 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: For discrete symmetry?

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:43.125 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: --do we have
to do this analysis?

00:45:43.125 --> 00:45:45.035 align:middle line:84%
Or can we can do
something similar?

00:45:45.035 --> 00:45:45.660 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:47.490 align:middle line:84%
In general for
discrete symmetries,

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:50.880 align:middle line:84%
you don't have such
a conservation law.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.800 align:middle line:84%
You don't have such
a conservation law.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:56.400 align:middle line:84%
But you can still sometimes
define some discrete quantum

00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.390 align:middle line:84%
number which is conserved,
like the parity which--

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:02.430 align:middle line:90%
in the parity case.

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:04.600 align:middle line:90%
But you don't have a current.

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:05.100 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:08.962 align:middle line:84%
So here, J mu is called
the conserved current.

00:46:08.962 --> 00:46:10.170 align:middle line:90%
But you won't have a current.

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:15.050 align:middle line:90%


00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:15.934 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:46:15.934 --> 00:46:16.820 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:24.570 align:middle line:84%
So this concludes our
very quick discussion

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:29.445 align:middle line:84%
of the important features
of classical field theory.

00:46:29.445 --> 00:46:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And with this preparation,
now we can start talking about

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:37.710 align:middle line:84%
or start thinking about
going to quantum mechanics,

00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:39.420 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
quantum fields.

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:40.440 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And so here is a good place to
pause a little bit from what

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:51.540 align:middle line:84%
we already said about the
classical field theory

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:57.300 align:middle line:84%
to anticipate a little bit
about the quantum fields theory.

00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:58.050 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:46:58.050 --> 00:47:09.190 align:middle line:84%
So here, I will restate our goal
for quantum field theory, which

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:13.900 align:middle line:84%
I said a little bit
in the last lecture.

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:15.820 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:19.390 align:middle line:84%
So now we have seen
the classical fields.

00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And our goal is to
understand the quantum

00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:24.250 align:middle line:90%
version of this story.

00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:24.880 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:30.070 align:middle line:84%
So classical field theory
is classical mechanics

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.110 align:middle line:84%
with infinite number
of degrees of freedom.

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:34.373 align:middle line:84%
And now we want to quantize
this infinite number

00:47:34.373 --> 00:47:35.290 align:middle line:90%
of degrees of freedom.

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And now this becomes
quantum field theory.

00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:37.720 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And now we want to understand
the quantum dynamics

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:42.760 align:middle line:90%
of such kind of phi fields.

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:43.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And for example, an
example is the E&M.

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:51.070 align:middle line:84%
We have electric
and magnetic fields.

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:51.760 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And you know the
Maxwell equations.

00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:56.080 align:middle line:84%
You can solve the
Maxwell equations.

00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And so this defines the
classical field theory.

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And then we will tell you how to
actually quantize such a system

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:09.820 align:middle line:84%
to understand the electric
field and the magnetic fields

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:11.620 align:middle line:90%
are quantum mechanical.

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:13.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:15.060 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.830 align:middle line:84%
And that actually
would be our goal.

00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:18.330 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So we will start with the
simplest field theory--

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:22.590 align:middle line:90%
just the scalar field theory.

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And then we will go
to the Dirac theory,

00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:28.320 align:middle line:90%
which describes the electron.

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And then, eventually, we will
go to the theory which describes

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:33.940 align:middle line:90%
the electromagnetic field.

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:36.480 align:middle line:90%
So this is called the QED, OK--

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.950 align:middle line:90%
quantum electrodynamics.

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:41.460 align:middle line:84%
So that will be the
endpoint of this course.

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:45.040 align:middle line:90%


00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:52.420 align:middle line:84%
So now let's say
a little bit how

00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:54.700 align:middle line:84%
we go through this
classical field theory

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:59.870 align:middle line:84%
to quantum field theory, OK--
so just some general remarks.

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So before doing that,
let's think a little bit

00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:04.298 align:middle line:84%
how we go from
classical mechanics,

00:49:04.298 --> 00:49:06.090 align:middle line:84%
with a small number of
degrees of freedom--

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:07.600 align:middle line:84%
and how you go to
quantum mechanics.

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:08.890 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:08.890 --> 00:49:12.435 align:middle line:90%
So let's recall.

00:49:12.435 --> 00:49:19.500 align:middle line:90%


00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.510 align:middle line:90%
So in classical mechanics--

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:23.962 align:middle line:90%


00:49:23.962 --> 00:49:25.670 align:middle line:84%
so let's just consider
the simplest case,

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:27.545 align:middle line:84%
if you just have a single
degree of freedom--

00:49:27.545 --> 00:49:31.970 align:middle line:84%
say x(t), OK-- just a
one-dimensional particle whose

00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:34.850 align:middle line:90%
motion just describes the x(t).

00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, the
goal of classical mechanics

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:43.470 align:middle line:84%
is just to solve the
equation of motion over x(t).

00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:44.430 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:48.870 align:middle line:84%
So if I write down the equation
for x(t) and I solve it,

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:50.440 align:middle line:90%
then I'm done.

00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:50.940 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:52.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm done.

00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:54.690 align:middle line:84%
I solved the
classical mechanics.

00:49:54.690 --> 00:50:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So when we go to quantum
mechanics, what do you do?

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:06.480 align:middle line:84%
So this x(t) then
becomes an operator.

00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:09.590 align:middle line:90%


00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:10.090 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:11.350 align:middle line:90%
So it becomes an operator.

00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:13.750 align:middle line:84%
So the classical
dynamical variable

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:16.340 align:middle line:90%
now becomes a quantum operator.

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And the equation of motion
of x(t), if you remember--

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and do you remember
what it becomes?

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:29.650 align:middle line:90%


00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:30.262 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:50:30.262 --> 00:50:31.720 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the
Heisenberg equation.

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:35.150 align:middle line:90%


00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes the Heisenberg
equation for this operator x(t)

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:43.420 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:45.250 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:46.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So in quantum mechanics,
there are normally two ways

00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:52.220 align:middle line:90%
to describe it.

00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:53.875 align:middle line:84%
So first is the
Schrodinger picture.

00:50:53.875 --> 00:51:00.240 align:middle line:90%


00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:08.115 align:middle line:84%
In this case, you have
a wave function, which

00:51:08.115 --> 00:51:09.240 align:middle line:90%
is the function of x and t.

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And then you have an
operator, which is x.

00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:13.184 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:51:13.184 --> 00:51:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, you
also have conjugate momentum,

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:20.930 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, which is
defined to be x dot.

00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:22.430 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And so the wave
function is a function

00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:30.460 align:middle line:90%
of the eigenvalues of--

00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:35.860 align:middle line:84%
so x here should be understood
as eigenvalues of this operator

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:37.300 align:middle line:90%
x-hat.

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:39.100 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.530 align:middle line:90%
It's the eigenvalue of x-hat.

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:43.270 align:middle line:84%
So in the Schrodinger
picture, you

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:46.810 align:middle line:90%
solve the evolution for psi.

00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:49.470 align:middle line:90%
You solve the equation for psi.

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:51.045 align:middle line:84%
And then once you
find psi, then you

00:51:51.045 --> 00:51:52.770 align:middle line:84%
can calculate any
quantities you want.

00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:53.270 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:56.910 align:middle line:84%
You can calculate any
expectation values,

00:51:56.910 --> 00:52:00.340 align:middle line:90%
any amplitude, et cetera.

00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:02.070 align:middle line:84%
But the second way
of approaching it

00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:03.270 align:middle line:90%
is the Heisenberg picture.

00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:13.010 align:middle line:90%


00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:16.400 align:middle line:90%
In this case, you--

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:19.910 align:middle line:84%
the dynamical quantity
is your operator.

00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Now you're assuming the
operator depend on time.

00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:23.600 align:middle line:84%
So in the Schrodinger
picture, your x

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:26.570 align:middle line:84%
is just some constant operator
that does not depend on time.

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:29.570 align:middle line:84%
But in the Heisenberg
picture, now your operator

00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:32.180 align:middle line:90%
now becomes time-dependent.

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:32.690 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:34.580 align:middle line:90%
And the equation of motion--

00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:36.770 align:middle line:84%
and then you solve the
Heisenberg equation.

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:37.460 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:40.020 align:middle line:90%
And then the state is invariant.

00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:40.520 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.470 align:middle line:84%
The state does not
evolve with time.

00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:43.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:47.490 align:middle line:84%
So you solve for the Heisenberg
equation for those operators.

00:52:47.490 --> 00:52:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And then once you solve
the Heisenberg equation,

00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and then you can
evaluate, again,

00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:54.560 align:middle line:84%
your expectation
value in any state

00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:57.620 align:middle line:84%
you are interested
in, et cetera.

00:52:57.620 --> 00:52:59.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:01.250 align:middle line:90%
So any questions on this?

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:02.910 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very
quick review of what

00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:07.200 align:middle line:84%
you did to go from classical
mechanics to quantum mechanics.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:15.940 align:middle line:84%
So now in field theory, OK,
we do the similar thing.

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:18.680 align:middle line:90%


00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So similarly, in field theory,
we have classical fields.

00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:29.760 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:32.060 align:middle line:90%
We have classical fields.

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And then when you go to quantum,
this become quantum operators.

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:41.150 align:middle line:90%


00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:41.650 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:46.560 align:middle line:84%
So this is now
quantum operators.

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Remember, in field
theory, this x is always

00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:52.980 align:middle line:90%
just labels of the space points.

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:53.940 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.570 align:middle line:90%
It's not a dynamical variable.

00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:56.070 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:58.420 align:middle line:90%
The notation is a little bit--

00:53:58.420 --> 00:53:58.920 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Here, in classical mechanics,
this is a dynamical variable.

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:04.210 align:middle line:84%
But in field theory,
this is just labels.

00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:04.710 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:middle line:90%
So they're not dynamical.

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:08.920 align:middle line:84%
The dynamical variable
are phi itself.

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:11.760 align:middle line:90%
So phi becomes an operator.

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.290 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And then now the
classical equation

00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:22.770 align:middle line:84%
of motion for phi,
which we derived--

00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:35.680 align:middle line:84%
and then become the Heisenberg
equation, OK, for phi-hat.

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:38.290 align:middle line:90%


00:54:38.290 --> 00:54:43.192 align:middle line:84%
So again, here, you
can do two pictures.

00:54:43.192 --> 00:54:44.650 align:middle line:84%
You can do the
Schrodinger picture,

00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:46.108 align:middle line:84%
or you can do a
Heisenberg picture.

00:54:46.108 --> 00:54:49.150 align:middle line:90%


00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:56.890 align:middle line:84%
So for QFT, the
Schrodinger picture--

00:54:56.890 --> 00:54:57.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And you look at
the wave functions

00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:02.850 align:middle line:84%
of your dynamical
variables, the eigenvalue

00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:04.290 align:middle line:90%
of dynamical variables.

00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:09.800 align:middle line:90%


00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:13.850 align:middle line:84%
So what is the generalization
of this psi xt?

00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:18.130 align:middle line:84%
So remember, here, psi is
a function of eigenvalue

00:55:18.130 --> 00:55:19.580 align:middle line:90%
of your dynamical variables.

00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:20.080 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:22.730 align:middle line:90%


00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:25.760 align:middle line:84%
So now, if we push
this analog further,

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:28.250 align:middle line:84%
when you go to quantum field
theory in the Schrodinger

00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:35.040 align:middle line:84%
picture, now the wave
function should be a function

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:40.410 align:middle line:90%
of phi (x) and the t.

00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:40.910 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:53.110 align:middle line:84%
So this phi x are
eigenvalues of phi-hat x.

00:55:53.110 --> 00:55:53.710 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So in the Schrodinger
picture, phi-hat

00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:58.990 align:middle line:90%
does not evolve with time.

00:55:58.990 --> 00:56:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And so you have
the wave function,

00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:04.590 align:middle line:90%
which is the function--

00:56:04.590 --> 00:56:07.560 align:middle line:90%
now become a functional--

00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:09.960 align:middle line:84%
because this itself is
a function of space.

00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:10.710 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:14.960 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you solve the
Schrodinger equation for this.

00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:22.890 align:middle line:90%
And then you have the operator.

00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:24.520 align:middle line:90%
And then you have the operator.

00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:26.220 align:middle line:90%
And so you have--

00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:27.690 align:middle line:84%
and then the
dynamical-- and then

00:56:27.690 --> 00:56:31.090 align:middle line:90%
you have operator phi-hat x.

00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:31.870 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:35.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's what you do in
the Schrodinger picture,

00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:38.650 align:middle line:90%
in the Schrodinger picture.

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And in the Heisenberg
picture, you

00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:46.190 align:middle line:90%
forget about the wave function.

00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:47.450 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:49.820 align:middle line:84%
You look at the
evolution of operators.

00:56:49.820 --> 00:57:11.513 align:middle line:90%


00:57:11.513 --> 00:57:13.180 align:middle line:84%
So the Heisenberg for
the field theory--

00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:18.100 align:middle line:90%


00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:21.310 align:middle line:84%
your Heisenberg picture
for the field theory

00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:25.870 align:middle line:84%
is that you look at the
evolution of x and t.

00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:28.790 align:middle line:84%
So now this just obeys
the Heisenberg equations,

00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:31.900 align:middle line:84%
which is just the
quantum version

00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:34.120 align:middle line:84%
of the classical
equation for phi.

00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:37.340 align:middle line:84%
So you look at the
evolution of this.

00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And then the state does
not change with time.

00:57:39.550 --> 00:57:40.360 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:41.860 align:middle line:84%
The state does not
change with time.

00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:45.030 align:middle line:90%


00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:45.553 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:57:45.553 --> 00:57:46.470 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:50.650 align:middle line:90%


00:57:50.650 --> 00:57:52.342 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:57:52.342 --> 00:57:53.710 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: When it comes to--

00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:55.930 align:middle line:90%
so we have the quantities--

00:57:55.930 --> 00:57:56.710 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:59.000 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: --what happens to
time in the Schrodinger picture?

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.708 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: So in the
Schrodinger picture--

00:58:00.708 --> 00:58:06.720 align:middle line:84%
so remember, the x
is a label for phi.

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.700 align:middle line:90%
But time is the evolution.

00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:11.440 align:middle line:84%
But in the Schrodinger picture,
the operators don't evolve.

00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:13.470 align:middle line:90%
And so there's no time here.

00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:14.970 align:middle line:90%
So we don't have time here.

00:58:14.970 --> 00:58:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And we just have the analog of
the x here in the Schrodinger

00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:23.640 align:middle line:84%
picture for classical--
yeah, for quantum mechanics.

00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And then the time dependence
is in your wave function.

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:30.210 align:middle line:84%
So the wave function
is a function

00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:35.990 align:middle line:84%
of possible values, eigenvalues
of this operator phi.

00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:37.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:39.433 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:58:39.433 --> 00:58:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And then the Heisenberg
picture-- again,

00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:43.690 align:middle line:84%
then you just focus on
the operator equations.

00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And once you solve the
operator equations,

00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:50.760 align:middle line:84%
and then you can calculate the
expectation values in any state

00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:51.960 align:middle line:90%
you want.

00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:53.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So now you can already maybe
see a difference a little bit.

00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:01.060 align:middle line:84%
So if you do the
Schrodinger picture,

00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:02.800 align:middle line:84%
you have to deal
with this beast,

00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:05.740 align:middle line:84%
OK, which is the
wave functional,

00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:10.410 align:middle line:84%
though, of all possible values
of some function in space.

00:59:10.410 --> 00:59:11.310 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you have multiple
fields, then this

00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:14.700 align:middle line:90%
is a hugely complicated thing.

00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And you need to write down
the Schrodinger equation

00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:18.030 align:middle line:90%
for it, et cetera.

00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:18.990 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:22.170 align:middle line:84%
But here-- but in the
Heisenberg picture,

00:59:22.170 --> 00:59:26.680 align:middle line:84%
we just solve the analog of the
classical equation of motion,

00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:28.650 align:middle line:84%
which we have
already written down.

00:59:28.650 --> 00:59:32.103 align:middle line:84%
And you just now interpret it
as a quantum operator equation.

00:59:32.103 --> 00:59:33.645 align:middle line:84%
So which one do you
think is simpler?

00:59:33.645 --> 00:59:38.000 align:middle line:90%


00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's why in
quantum field theory

00:59:40.570 --> 00:59:43.280 align:middle line:84%
we almost always use
Heisenberg picture.

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:43.780 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:45.400 align:middle line:84%
We always use
Heisenberg picture.

00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:47.380 align:middle line:90%
And we don't even--

00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:49.960 align:middle line:84%
rarely think about
the wave function,

00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:54.040 align:middle line:84%
even though sometimes this can
be useful in some problems.

00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:56.750 align:middle line:84%
But for most of the time,
this is much easier.

00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:57.250 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:59:57.250 --> 00:59:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we
are going to do.

00:59:59.000 --> 00:59:59.500 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And so in quantum
field theory, we

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:05.140 align:middle line:84%
will just use the Heisenberg
picture almost all the time.

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:06.470 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:10.800 align:middle line:84%
From now on, I will not talk
about the Schrodinger picture.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:11.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:15.960 align:middle line:90%


01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:16.500 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:21.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important
you remind yourself

01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:25.510 align:middle line:84%
about quantum mechanics in
the Heisenberg picture, OK--

01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And because most of your
quantum mechanical classes

01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:33.760 align:middle line:84%
before maybe is all in
the Schrodinger picture,

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:37.370 align:middle line:84%
solving the Schrodinger
equation, et cetera.

01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:39.310 align:middle line:84%
But now you have to
change the perspective

01:00:39.310 --> 01:00:42.550 align:middle line:84%
to think of everything in terms
of the Heisenberg picture.

01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:44.800 align:middle line:90%
And then that will make you--

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.360 align:middle line:84%
quantum field
theory much easier.

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:46.860 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:51.440 align:middle line:90%


01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:51.940 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:52.950 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:59.400 align:middle line:90%


01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:03.090 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So in the
Heisenberg picture,

01:01:03.090 --> 01:01:06.600 align:middle line:84%
if we're not concerned about
the wave function and all,

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:10.680 align:middle line:84%
then how do we determine,
for example, the probability

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.740 align:middle line:84%
or the expectation
value of where

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:16.755 align:middle line:84%
x is at some point
from the momentum?

01:01:16.755 --> 01:01:17.880 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Good, good, good.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:20.310 align:middle line:90%
That's a very good question.

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:25.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is actually
also related to the kind

01:01:25.410 --> 01:01:28.960 align:middle line:84%
of questions we want to solve
in quantum field theory.

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So in quantum field
theory, we often

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.190 align:middle line:90%
work with the vacuum state.

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:37.210 align:middle line:90%
So for example, here--

01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:37.710 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:39.127 align:middle line:84%
So when you can
see that the QED--

01:01:39.127 --> 01:01:44.100 align:middle line:84%
most of the time in the quantum
electric or magnetic field,

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:45.750 align:middle line:90%
they're in the vacuum state.

01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And so we just consider the
psi in the vacuum state.

01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't
have to consider--

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:53.940 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:54.600 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:55.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:01:55.330 --> 01:01:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And so normally in
quantum field theory,

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:02.510 align:middle line:84%
there are preferred states
we are interested in.

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:06.387 align:middle line:84%
But that's a lot of the reason
that the Heisenberg picture

01:02:06.387 --> 01:02:06.970 align:middle line:90%
is convenient.

01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:08.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:11.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to consider
the general state, in general.

01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:12.112 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:02:12.112 --> 01:02:14.320 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So what is the
physical meaning of the wave

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:15.835 align:middle line:90%
function as it goes beyond the--

01:02:15.835 --> 01:02:16.990 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Hmm?

01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:17.650 align:middle line:90%
Sorry?

01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:20.420 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: What is the
physical meaning of psi here?

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:23.600 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Oh, this is just some
state you are interested in.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.540 align:middle line:90%
Still, you have a Hilbert space.

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:27.430 align:middle line:90%
But now you just don't--

01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:32.230 align:middle line:84%
when you study the evolution,
you only evolve the operator.

01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:33.370 align:middle line:90%
You don't evolve states.

01:02:33.370 --> 01:02:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that's the difference
between the Schrodinger

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.500 align:middle line:90%
and the Heisenberg picture.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:40.670 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: But for example,
in quantum mechanics,

01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:44.588 align:middle line:84%
we get the expectation values
of some operators with respect

01:02:44.588 --> 01:02:45.130 align:middle line:90%
to the state.

01:02:45.130 --> 01:02:47.783 align:middle line:90%
And we get, like, measurements--

01:02:47.783 --> 01:02:48.700 align:middle line:90%
the results and stuff.

01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:50.410 align:middle line:90%
So what about here?

01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:51.910 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah,
it's the same thing.

01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:53.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, same thing.

01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:53.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:55.390 align:middle line:84%
At this level,
there's no difference

01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:57.760 align:middle line:84%
between quantum field theory
and quantum mechanics.

01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just think about
quantum mechanics

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.120 align:middle line:90%
in terms of Heisenberg picture.

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Translate everything you
learned about the Schrodinger

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:07.340 align:middle line:84%
evolution, et cetera, in
terms of Heisenberg picture.

01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:07.998 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:03:07.998 --> 01:03:10.040 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: And now the open
state is conventional.

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:10.932 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Hmm?

01:03:10.932 --> 01:03:12.260 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: The open state is--

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:12.980 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, that's right.

01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:13.522 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

01:03:13.522 --> 01:03:14.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:15.256 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:03:15.256 --> 01:03:17.630 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Am I right that
the state we're interested in

01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:19.310 align:middle line:90%
is generally the vacuum state.

01:03:19.310 --> 01:03:22.735 align:middle line:90%
And what sorts of measurements--

01:03:22.735 --> 01:03:23.360 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:28.940 align:middle line:90%
So it's-- again, so--

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:31.410 align:middle line:90%
yeah, it's a very good question.

01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:33.710 align:middle line:84%
What I should have
said is that the states

01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:35.720 align:middle line:84%
that we are interested
in are states which

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:37.630 align:middle line:90%
are close to the vacuum state.

01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:40.670 align:middle line:84%
So you excite the
vacuum a little bit.

01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it's not-- yeah,
of course, in the vacuum,

01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:45.210 align:middle line:90%
you don't have anything.

01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And we are since close
to the vacuum state.

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:48.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:50.711 align:middle line:84%
And later, when we discuss
things, you will see.

01:03:50.711 --> 01:03:51.211 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:03:51.211 --> 01:03:54.645 align:middle line:90%


01:03:54.645 --> 01:03:55.145 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:03:55.145 --> 01:03:55.640 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:56.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:59.390 align:middle line:90%


01:03:59.390 --> 01:04:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So before going into
quantum field theory,

01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:21.020 align:middle line:84%
let's also make some remarks,
have a short discussion

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:23.490 align:middle line:84%
on relativistic
quantum mechanics.

01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:24.950 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:38.210 align:middle line:84%
So naively, if you
have special relativity

01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:42.480 align:middle line:90%
plus quantum mechanics--

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:45.050 align:middle line:84%
so if you want to generalized--
so most of the quantum

01:04:45.050 --> 01:04:48.050 align:middle line:84%
mechanics you learned is
the non-relativistic quantum

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:48.630 align:middle line:90%
mechanics.

01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:49.130 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:51.800 align:middle line:84%
But now if you want to
incorporate special--

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.840 align:middle line:84%
we want to combine
the special relativity

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.370 align:middle line:90%
with quantum mechanics.

01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:58.355 align:middle line:90%
And then what should you get?

01:04:58.355 --> 01:04:59.730 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
you should get?

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:04.221 align:middle line:90%


01:05:04.221 --> 01:05:06.097 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:06.097 --> 01:05:07.011 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Hmm?

01:05:07.011 --> 01:05:09.220 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:10.840 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: I expect--

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:13.979 align:middle line:84%
yeah, just whatever
come to your mind.

01:05:13.979 --> 01:05:14.854 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:14.854 --> 01:05:15.437 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Hmm?

01:05:15.437 --> 01:05:17.125 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:17.125 --> 01:05:18.080 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:18.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:21.610 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: That's
the right answer.

01:05:21.610 --> 01:05:22.990 align:middle line:90%
That's the correct answer.

01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:26.830 align:middle line:84%
But I was hoping some
of you will say it's

01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:28.300 align:middle line:90%
relativistic quantum mechanics.

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:28.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:30.610 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:37.210 align:middle line:84%
So naively, when you
combine these two--

01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:40.870 align:middle line:84%
in particular, if you read some
old quantum mechanics books,

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:44.490 align:middle line:84%
they do discuss relativistic
quantum mechanics.

01:05:44.490 --> 01:05:44.990 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:49.240 align:middle line:84%
So naively, that's what you get,
OK, when you combine these two.

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And you say, oh, we just get the
relativistic quantum mechanics.

01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:53.647 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:05:53.647 --> 01:05:55.480 align:middle line:84%
But that's actually not
a correct statement.

01:05:55.480 --> 01:06:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Actually, strictly
speaking, the reason now

01:06:00.610 --> 01:06:04.510 align:middle line:84%
you don't actually learn much
about the relativistic quantum

01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:06.260 align:middle line:84%
mechanics is because,
strictly speaking,

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:08.990 align:middle line:84%
relativistic quantum
mechanics does not exist.

01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:09.680 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And whenever-- if you want
to combine quantum mechanics

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:16.165 align:middle line:84%
with special
relativity, actually,

01:06:16.165 --> 01:06:17.540 align:middle line:84%
you get the quantum
field theory.

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.165 align:middle line:84%
So the quantum field
theory is actually

01:06:19.165 --> 01:06:23.720 align:middle line:84%
forced on us if you want
to unify special relativity

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:24.710 align:middle line:90%
and quantum mechanics.

01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:28.340 align:middle line:84%
OK-- and even if you don't
want to talk about the fields.

01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:28.877 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:06:28.877 --> 01:06:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Even if you don't want
to talk about fields,

01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:33.380 align:middle line:84%
if you just want to talk
about particles, still,

01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:35.990 align:middle line:84%
if you want to unify these
two, then it actually

01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:38.930 align:middle line:84%
automatically leads to
quantum field theory.

01:06:38.930 --> 01:06:43.460 align:middle line:84%
So now let me just explain
why this is the case, OK,

01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:48.425 align:middle line:84%
so that you have some better
appreciation of the quantum

01:06:48.425 --> 01:06:51.350 align:middle line:90%
field theory.

01:06:51.350 --> 01:06:51.950 align:middle line:90%
Good?

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:56.180 align:middle line:84%
So let's try to
apply what you did

01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:59.120 align:middle line:84%
for non-relativistic
quantum mechanics,

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:02.430 align:middle line:84%
try to generalize it to derive
some relativistic quantum

01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:02.930 align:middle line:90%
mechanics.

01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:03.430 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:06.800 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you are
the people in 1926.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:07.550 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:07:07.550 --> 01:07:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Quantum mechanics
just was discovered.

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And you say, oh,
people have understood

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:13.680 align:middle line:84%
the non-relativistic
quantum mechanics.

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Now let's generalize
to special relativity.

01:07:17.010 --> 01:07:17.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:28.960 align:middle line:84%
So in non-relativistic
quantum mechanics,

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:32.680 align:middle line:84%
how do we derive the
Schrodinger equation?

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:38.410 align:middle line:84%
The way we do this is we start
with the dispersion relation,

01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:42.380 align:middle line:84%
OK, for a
non-relativistic particle.

01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:44.900 align:middle line:90%
And then we say this--

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:50.550 align:middle line:90%
take E to I partial t, OK, p--

01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:55.270 align:middle line:84%
so say, if you kind of
have a vector become--

01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:57.160 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so don't let me
forget about h-bar.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Just p then becomes
spatial derivatives.

01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And then this equation just
become the Schrodinger equation

01:08:03.130 --> 01:08:04.390 align:middle line:90%
for the free particles.

01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:15.680 align:middle line:90%


01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:16.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:18.250 align:middle line:84%
So this becomes the
Schrodinger equation

01:08:18.250 --> 01:08:20.590 align:middle line:84%
for free non-relativistic
particles.

01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:22.548 align:middle line:84%
And then you can add the
potentials, et cetera.

01:08:22.548 --> 01:08:23.048 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:08:23.048 --> 01:08:25.210 align:middle line:84%
So that's how you derive
your Schrodinger equation

01:08:25.210 --> 01:08:28.660 align:middle line:84%
for non-relativistic
quantum mechanics.

01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:31.990 align:middle line:84%
But if you are someone, say,
in the early days of quantum

01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:37.029 align:middle line:84%
mechanics, say, now let's
try to generalize it

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:40.569 align:middle line:90%
to special relativity.

01:08:40.569 --> 01:08:44.724 align:middle line:84%
And then it's easy to do then
in the relativistic case.

01:08:44.724 --> 01:08:49.640 align:middle line:90%


01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:52.706 align:middle line:84%
Then you have-- we just
start with the relativistic

01:08:52.706 --> 01:08:53.539 align:middle line:90%
dispersion relation.

01:08:53.539 --> 01:08:56.100 align:middle line:90%


01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:56.600 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.000 align:middle line:84%
You say, let's do
the same thing.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:08:59.500 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:00.649 align:middle line:90%
Let's do the same thing.

01:09:00.649 --> 01:09:03.819 align:middle line:90%
So this becomes I partial t.

01:09:03.819 --> 01:09:06.490 align:middle line:90%
And this p becomes this one.

01:09:06.490 --> 01:09:08.904 align:middle line:84%
And then we can just
write this equation.

01:09:08.904 --> 01:09:20.794 align:middle line:90%


01:09:20.794 --> 01:09:21.294 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:09:21.294 --> 01:09:25.500 align:middle line:90%


01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:28.050 align:middle line:84%
So now let's combine with
these derivatives together--

01:09:28.050 --> 01:09:30.720 align:middle line:84%
or put all this
on the same side.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:32.795 align:middle line:84%
And then what you find is
partial mu, partial mu.

01:09:32.795 --> 01:09:42.990 align:middle line:90%


01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:43.490 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:44.705 align:middle line:90%
That's what you get.

01:09:44.705 --> 01:09:46.205 align:middle line:84%
So does this equation
look familiar?

01:09:46.205 --> 01:09:49.310 align:middle line:90%


01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:49.810 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:53.800 align:middle line:84%
So this is the simplest scalar
field theory equation of motion

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.600 align:middle line:90%
we have written down.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.580 align:middle line:84%
But here, the interpretation
is very different.

01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:58.330 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:09:58.330 --> 01:10:00.680 align:middle line:84%
So earlier, we wrote
down this equation.

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.395 align:middle line:84%
We say this is
Klein-Gordon equation.

01:10:02.395 --> 01:10:06.508 align:middle line:90%


01:10:06.508 --> 01:10:08.050 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
Klein-Gordon equation.

01:10:08.050 --> 01:10:08.320 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.910 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
equation of motion

01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:12.373 align:middle line:84%
for the simplest
free-field scalar field

01:10:12.373 --> 01:10:13.540 align:middle line:90%
theory we wrote down before.

01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:16.980 align:middle line:84%
But here, the interpretation
is very different.

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:20.980 align:middle line:84%
So remember, the psi is not
a field in quantum mechanics.

01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:26.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a wave function for a
single particle sitting--

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:33.780 align:middle line:84%
so the psi is the amplitude for
a particle at spatial location

01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:35.770 align:middle line:90%
x at time t.

01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:36.270 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:38.970 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- and it's square
gives its probability.

01:10:38.970 --> 01:10:39.810 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:10:39.810 --> 01:10:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And this does not
describe a field.

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:42.000 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.850 align:middle line:84%
This is a wave function
of a single particle,

01:10:44.850 --> 01:10:48.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, even though they have the
same equation as the field

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:53.110 align:middle line:90%
theory we wrote down earlier.

01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
Klein-Gordon did.

01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:58.080 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.653 align:middle line:84%
So the Klein-Gordon--
we try to generalize

01:11:00.653 --> 01:11:02.070 align:middle line:84%
non-relativistic
quantum mechanics

01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:03.625 align:middle line:84%
to relativistic
quantum mechanics.

01:11:03.625 --> 01:11:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And then they wrote
down this equation.

01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:08.050 align:middle line:84%
They say, ah, now
we are immortal.

01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:08.550 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:09.050 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Because we wrote down
the first equation

01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:17.580 align:middle line:84%
for relativistic
quantum mechanics.

01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And then soon realized,
actually, this equation--

01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:31.820 align:middle line:84%
if you want to interpret it as
the right equation for the wave

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:34.850 align:middle line:84%
function, we have
actually lots of problems.

01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:37.510 align:middle line:90%


01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:38.770 align:middle line:90%
There are various problems.

01:11:38.770 --> 01:11:40.468 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, by saying "lots of"--

01:11:40.468 --> 01:11:42.510 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's a little bit
of an exaggeration there.

01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:45.920 align:middle line:90%
There are various problems.

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:53.050 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

01:11:53.050 --> 01:11:56.680 align:middle line:84%
So some-- yeah, let me
call this equation--

01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:03.040 align:middle line:90%
I think I've used up my stars.

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.770 align:middle line:84%
I think to have a four star
is a little bit too much.

01:12:05.770 --> 01:12:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's just call this equation
"1" for this section.

01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:31.160 align:middle line:84%
So some immediate
difficulties of interpreting 1

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:41.980 align:middle line:84%
as a wave equation, OK, for
a relativistic particle--

01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:46.480 align:middle line:90%


01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:49.340 align:middle line:90%
yeah, let me just save time.

01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:49.840 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:54.040 align:middle line:84%
So this is the wave equation
for a non-relativistic particle.

01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:57.275 align:middle line:84%
If you want to generalize to
relativistic quantum mechanics,

01:12:57.275 --> 01:12:58.900 align:middle line:84%
then you would
interpret this as a wave

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:02.500 align:middle line:84%
equation for a single
relativistic particle.

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:04.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:16.670 align:middle line:90%
So first is that--

01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:19.800 align:middle line:90%
so if you remember--

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:25.210 align:middle line:90%
so in this equation, OK, for--

01:13:25.210 --> 01:13:27.580 align:middle line:84%
if you go back to
your early days

01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:32.590 align:middle line:84%
of non-relativistic quantum
mechanics-- so you remember,

01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:36.340 align:middle line:84%
from this equation,
you can derive

01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:39.400 align:middle line:84%
an equation for the
conserved probability,

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.680 align:middle line:90%
OK, a conserved probability.

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And that equation tells
you that psi-squared

01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:49.930 align:middle line:84%
should have the interpretation
of the probability.

01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:51.700 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:13:51.700 --> 01:14:09.690 align:middle line:84%
So-- but for that equation, you
can show there's no quantity

01:14:09.690 --> 01:14:12.190 align:middle line:90%
that can be--

01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:20.905 align:middle line:84%
that no quantity that can be
used as probability density.

01:14:20.905 --> 01:14:31.410 align:middle line:90%


01:14:31.410 --> 01:14:32.100 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:34.830 align:middle line:84%
So probability
density by definition

01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:37.060 align:middle line:90%
should satisfy two conditions.

01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:39.360 align:middle line:84%
So the first condition is
that it's non-negative.

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:44.050 align:middle line:90%


01:14:44.050 --> 01:14:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And the second condition is
that it should be conserved.

01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:47.920 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.253 align:middle line:90%
The probability should conserve.

01:14:49.253 --> 01:14:52.870 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, you violate the--

01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:54.100 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So you can show that this
equation does not allow.

01:14:58.510 --> 01:15:00.230 align:middle line:84%
This equation allows
such a quantity,

01:15:00.230 --> 01:15:02.230 align:middle line:84%
but this equation
does not allow.

01:15:02.230 --> 01:15:02.860 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And I will not go
through that myself.

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:08.710 align:middle line:84%
I think that will
be in your Pset 2.

01:15:08.710 --> 01:15:10.030 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:11.230 align:middle line:90%
That will be in your Pset 2.

01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:12.325 align:middle line:90%
You will show it yourself.

01:15:12.325 --> 01:15:15.710 align:middle line:90%


01:15:15.710 --> 01:15:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And the second difficulty
is that if you square that--

01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:24.610 align:middle line:90%
if you find the energy--

01:15:24.610 --> 01:15:27.360 align:middle line:90%


01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:30.180 align:middle line:84%
if you take the square root,
then the energy in principle

01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:34.800 align:middle line:90%
can be, say, plus-minus.

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:37.010 align:middle line:90%
You have two solutions.

01:15:37.010 --> 01:15:37.520 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:42.550 align:middle line:84%
E equal to plus-minus
this quantity.

01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So in contrast to that equation,
there's only positive energy.

01:15:46.690 --> 01:15:47.190 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:15:47.190 --> 01:15:49.360 align:middle line:84%
In non-relativistic, you
just have positive energy.

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:51.190 align:middle line:84%
So classically,
you can just say,

01:15:51.190 --> 01:15:53.840 align:middle line:84%
let's throw away
the second branch.

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.040 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:58.130 align:middle line:84%
We can just throw away
the second branch phi-hat,

01:15:58.130 --> 01:15:58.910 align:middle line:90%
classically.

01:15:58.910 --> 01:16:01.290 align:middle line:90%
But quantum mechanically--

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:01.790 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:13.830 align:middle line:84%
So classically, just
ignore the second branch,

01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:14.730 align:middle line:90%
the negative branch.

01:16:14.730 --> 01:16:21.440 align:middle line:90%


01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:21.940 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:25.630 align:middle line:84%
But quantum mechanically,
this is not possible

01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:27.280 align:middle line:84%
because you have
the equation there.

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Then you automatically have
the negative solutions.

01:16:29.650 --> 01:16:30.190 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:16:30.190 --> 01:16:33.100 align:middle line:84%
So quantum mechanically-- and
then you have a dispersion

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:33.925 align:middle line:90%
relation like this.

01:16:33.925 --> 01:16:36.630 align:middle line:90%


01:16:36.630 --> 01:16:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So that dispersion relation
has the following form--

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:42.415 align:middle line:90%
is phi E as a function of p.

01:16:42.415 --> 01:16:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And so you have a
positive branch.

01:16:44.170 --> 01:16:46.797 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
a negative branch.

01:16:46.797 --> 01:16:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And then you remember,
in quantum mechanics,

01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:52.060 align:middle line:90%
you have energy levels.

01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:55.220 align:middle line:90%
And you have energy levels.

01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And such particles--
the particles here

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.860 align:middle line:84%
then have a higher energy
than particles here.

01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:01.430 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And so here, the energy level
is higher than the energy level

01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:05.600 align:middle line:90%
here.

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's always a
non-zero probability quantum

01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:11.780 align:middle line:84%
mechanically for a particle
to go from some higher energy

01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:13.310 align:middle line:84%
level to the lower
energy level, OK,

01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:14.602 align:middle line:90%
just like in the hydrogen atom.

01:17:14.602 --> 01:17:20.040 align:middle line:84%
If you excite it, they always
go to the lower energy level.

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So then quantum mechanically,
such a thing cannot be avoided.

01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:23.960 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:26.210 align:middle line:84%
So you cannot just
throw this branch away.

01:17:26.210 --> 01:17:26.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And so this will
lead to instability

01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:39.450 align:middle line:84%
because the energy can
be infinitely negative.

01:17:39.450 --> 01:17:39.950 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:41.200 align:middle line:90%
It can be infinitely negative.

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:44.192 align:middle line:84%
And then all your
particles will all

01:17:44.192 --> 01:17:45.650 align:middle line:84%
go to infinitely
negative energies.

01:17:45.650 --> 01:17:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And then your system
will be in big problem.

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:52.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:53.970 align:middle line:90%
So these are the two--

01:17:53.970 --> 01:18:01.000 align:middle line:90%


01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.560 align:middle line:90%
are the most prominent problems.

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And then people tried
many different ways

01:18:09.170 --> 01:18:12.010 align:middle line:84%
to try to avoid them, et
cetera, including some very

01:18:12.010 --> 01:18:13.480 align:middle line:90%
ingenious solutions, et cetera.

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:16.153 align:middle line:84%
Though, we will
not go into them.

01:18:16.153 --> 01:18:17.820 align:middle line:84%
But let me just mention
there's actually

01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:21.670 align:middle line:84%
even-- if you can
address those problems,

01:18:21.670 --> 01:18:24.340 align:middle line:84%
still, the relativistic
quantum mechanics

01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:28.280 align:middle line:84%
will not make sense for a
very fundamental reason.

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:30.580 align:middle line:84%
So these are more like
superficial reasons

01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:32.960 align:middle line:84%
why that equation
does not quite work.

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:33.460 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:37.270 align:middle line:84%
But there's actually a
more fundamental reason

01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:43.810 align:middle line:84%
why relativistic quantum
mechanics even as a concept

01:18:43.810 --> 01:18:44.720 align:middle line:90%
does not make sense.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:45.220 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:51.030 align:middle line:90%


01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:57.240 align:middle line:84%
So by definition, if you want
to interpret this kind of thing

01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:58.990 align:middle line:90%
as a wave function--

01:18:58.990 --> 01:18:59.490 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:18:59.490 --> 01:19:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So what's an interpretation
of the wave function,

01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:03.390 align:middle line:90%
which we already said?

01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:07.830 align:middle line:84%
So this describes the
amplitude for a single particle

01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:10.870 align:middle line:90%
at some point, OK--

01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:14.760 align:middle line:90%
at some point x at time t.

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:18.420 align:middle line:84%
But now, if you have two
particles, what do you do?

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:24.240 align:middle line:84%
You introduce the location for
particle 1, and the particle 2,

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:25.810 align:middle line:90%
and the t.

01:19:25.810 --> 01:19:26.310 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:28.047 align:middle line:90%
So this describes two particles.

01:19:28.047 --> 01:19:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to
describe three particles,

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:31.297 align:middle line:84%
then you have to
introduce more x.

01:19:31.297 --> 01:19:31.797 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:19:31.797 --> 01:19:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Remember, that's what you did
in non-relativistic quantum

01:19:34.230 --> 01:19:35.190 align:middle line:90%
mechanics.

01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:37.050 align:middle line:84%
So in non-relativistic
quantum mechanics,

01:19:37.050 --> 01:19:40.140 align:middle line:84%
this makes sense, OK,
and just because there's

01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:44.460 align:middle line:84%
no mixing between the
different branches--

01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:45.960 align:middle line:84%
say, single particle,
two particles.

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Because a particle cannot
be created and destroyed

01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:53.130 align:middle line:90%
in a non-relativistic system.

01:19:53.130 --> 01:19:55.590 align:middle line:84%
But in a relativistic
system, you

01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:57.760 align:middle line:90%
can always create particles.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:58.260 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:02.085 align:middle line:84%
If you have enough energy,
you can create new particles.

01:20:02.085 --> 01:20:04.210 align:middle line:90%
A pair create electrons.

01:20:04.210 --> 01:20:04.710 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:20:04.710 --> 01:20:06.600 align:middle line:84%
It happens in the
accelerator all the time.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Or electrons-- they can
annihilate into photons.

01:20:10.150 --> 01:20:10.650 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:20:10.650 --> 01:20:15.940 align:middle line:84%
So the particles are
not conserved, OK,

01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:16.690 align:middle line:90%
are not conserved.

01:20:16.690 --> 01:20:20.650 align:middle line:84%
So this kind of wave function
concept don't even make sense.

01:20:20.650 --> 01:20:24.750 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to describe-- so
that means, whenever you have

01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:28.260 align:middle line:84%
special relativity and
quantum mechanics together,

01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:32.910 align:middle line:84%
you must have a framework which
can describe arbitrary number

01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:35.540 align:middle line:90%
of particles at the same time.

01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:36.040 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:38.110 align:middle line:84%
Because particle numbers
can change all the time,

01:20:38.110 --> 01:20:41.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, because of annihilation
and the creation effect.

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And that cannot be achieved
by this kind of concept.

01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:49.290 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be achieved
by wave function.

01:20:49.290 --> 01:20:51.810 align:middle line:84%
It turns out
miraculously that it can

01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:53.700 align:middle line:90%
be achieved by field theory.

01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:57.750 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that field
theory, once you quantize it,

01:20:57.750 --> 01:21:00.750 align:middle line:84%
automatically gives
you a framework

01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:04.240 align:middle line:84%
to describe arbitrary
number of particles,

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:08.880 align:middle line:84%
OK, in the unified manner, OK--
single particle, two particles,

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:10.170 align:middle line:90%
arbitrary number of particles.

01:21:10.170 --> 01:21:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And so this is one of the
magic of field theory.

01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:15.870 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the field theory
plays such an important role

01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:21.960 align:middle line:84%
in particle physics, is because
the excitations of fields

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.760 align:middle line:84%
automatically
provides the mechanism

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.870 align:middle line:84%
to describe arbitrary
number of particles.

01:21:25.870 --> 01:21:26.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:21:26.370 --> 01:21:28.760 align:middle line:90%
So we will stop here today.

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:32.000 align:middle line:90%
