00:00:05.423 --> 00:00:10.670 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.880 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Let us start.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So last lecture, we discussed
the Compton scattering.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.220 align:middle line:84%
So with that example
essentially we

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.970 align:middle line:84%
covered all the tree-level
diagrams in QED.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.680 align:middle line:84%
So tree-level diagrams means
those not involving loop.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:59.120 align:middle line:84%
OK so far encountered diagrams,
which are called the tree-level

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.140 align:middle line:90%
-- without loops.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.675 align:middle line:84%
So these are called just
tree-level diagrams.

00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:18.280 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And so now you should be
able to actually treat

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.980 align:middle line:84%
all possible
tree-level diagrams.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.950 align:middle line:84%
You already have all
the tools to treat

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:84%
all possible
tree-level diagrams.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.010 align:middle line:84%
But tree-level
diagrams, actually there

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.655 align:middle line:84%
are many important
things missing just

00:01:40.655 --> 00:01:41.780 align:middle line:90%
in the tree-level diagrams.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.450 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.550 align:middle line:84%
So now today we will talk
about how to go beyond that,

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.820 align:middle line:84%
so we talk about
quantum fluctuations.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:11.230 align:middle line:90%


00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very big
subject and actually will

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.710 align:middle line:84%
consist of a big chunk of
quantum field theory II.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.860 align:middle line:84%
So here it's more
just to give you

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.145 align:middle line:84%
a preview of the basic
idea of the subject.

00:02:29.145 --> 00:02:32.620 align:middle line:90%


00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.860 align:middle line:84%
So one feature of the tree-level
diagram we have encountered.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:47.620 align:middle line:90%


00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
summarize the say

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.405 align:middle line:84%
features of tree-level
diagrams, what would you say?

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:59.300 align:middle line:90%


00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.770 align:middle line:90%
Other than the looks.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Other than looks like tree.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:03.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.130 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: There's
like no free momenta.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.060 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Exactly.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:22.380 align:middle line:84%
So the key is that all
intermediate momentum

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:29.940 align:middle line:84%
say in all propagators,
all intermediate momenta,

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:37.370 align:middle line:84%
they are determined
from external ones.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:45.220 align:middle line:90%


00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So when you treat the
tree-level diagram,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.780 align:middle line:90%
there's no momentum integration.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:03.960 align:middle line:90%


00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.370 align:middle line:84%
So this looks like a very
simple mathematical feature,

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.100 align:middle line:84%
but actually it
turns out there's

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.930 align:middle line:84%
a profound difference, both
mathematically and physically.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:23.160 align:middle line:84%
When you include the loops,
there are profound differences.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.630 align:middle line:90%
And also you can show that the--

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.420 align:middle line:90%
So now let me just summarize.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:45.160 align:middle line:84%
So now when including
the loops, there are many

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:90%
new features arises.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And so let me just first
give you some simple examples

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.260 align:middle line:90%
including loops.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.630 align:middle line:84%
So let's just consider say for
example one is just consider

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.370 align:middle line:84%
the electron propagator
and it's just a line.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.550 align:middle line:84%
But now you can consider
adding a photon line here.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.210 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.840 align:middle line:90%
Adding a photon line.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.400 align:middle line:84%
So this is the process
and now you have a loop.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.850 align:middle line:84%
It consists of this photon
line and this electron line.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And so you can consider
this as a process

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.170 align:middle line:84%
that the electron propagates,
and then can emit a photon,

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.400 align:middle line:90%
and then it absorbs itself.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.920 align:middle line:84%
So this photon is
purely virtual.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.250 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.620 align:middle line:90%
It's purely a virtual photon.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.360 align:middle line:84%
But such kind of
process actually

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.180 align:middle line:84%
affects the propagation
of an electron.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So you can view these
photons as something

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.300 align:middle line:90%
fluctuate from the vacuum.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.870 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine these come
from the vacuum fluctuations.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.500 align:middle line:90%


00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.330 align:middle line:90%
So this is one process.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And another simple
process, if you consider

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.510 align:middle line:90%
propagation of a photon.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.250 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And then the photon
can actually break up,

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.550 align:middle line:84%
say can compare create the
electron and the positron pair.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.570 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And then this pair can
annihilate again and then

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.100 align:middle line:90%
to form another photon.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.190 align:middle line:90%


00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is a correction
to just a simple propagation

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.200 align:middle line:90%
of a single photon.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.080 align:middle line:84%
So initial state
is still one photon

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.180 align:middle line:84%
and the final state
is still one photon,

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.610 align:middle line:84%
but something
happens in between.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And again, this something
that happens in between,

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.670 align:middle line:84%
you can interpret it as some
kind of vacuum fluctuation.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:51.780 align:middle line:84%
So both electron and positron
here are completely virtual.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.640 align:middle line:84%
There's no real
electrons you can detect.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.660 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.870 align:middle line:84%
So the third simple
process is this one,

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:06.640 align:middle line:84%
remember we have the electron,
the photon interacting vertex.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.030 align:middle line:90%
So this is i e gamma mu.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.090 align:middle line:84%
So this is the electron
phonon interaction vertex.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And this vertex can
also be corrected.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.700 align:middle line:90%
So imagine you have a photon.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.250 align:middle line:84%
So imagine the electron when
it comes to and then first

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.750 align:middle line:84%
emit a photon and then get
absorbed by the electron which

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.960 align:middle line:90%
comes out.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And so this will
correct the vertex,

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.190 align:middle line:84%
and so this is called
the vertex corrections.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So these two correct the
propagator and this one

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.650 align:middle line:90%
is the corrected vertex.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.560 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
simplest loop diagrams.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.360 align:middle line:84%
These are the simplest
loop diagrams.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.940 align:middle line:84%
In each of them here,
there's a single loop

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and then there's a free
momentum in the loop.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.200 align:middle line:84%
So you have to integrate over
the momentum in this loop

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.670 align:middle line:84%
because it's no longer
determined by external momenta.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:06.200 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer
determined by external.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.580 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out such kind
of momentum integration,

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:17.750 align:middle line:84%
so if I call this momentum k,
and then you were involving--

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.320 align:middle line:90%


00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So let me first talk about
the mathematical features.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.930 align:middle line:90%


00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:38.390 align:middle line:84%
So mathematical new
features for loop diagram.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:44.243 align:middle line:84%
So mathematically now you
need to integrate over

00:08:44.243 --> 00:08:45.160 align:middle line:90%
the internal momentum.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:50.320 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.740 align:middle line:84%
So now you have some free
momentum to integrate.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.440 align:middle line:90%


00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:01.390 align:middle line:84%
So this may look like
something just not very--

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.430 align:middle line:84%
you may say this
is not a big deal,

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.950 align:middle line:84%
but actually this turns
out to be a very big deal

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:12.380 align:middle line:84%
because this momentum,
this integration, just

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:16.560 align:middle line:84%
by definition, is you integrate
over all possible momentum.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.110 align:middle line:90%


00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.180 align:middle line:84%
So each k is integrated
from minus infinity

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.520 align:middle line:90%
to plus infinity.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:32.690 align:middle line:84%
So in particular, this
includes the region

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:37.320 align:middle line:84%
that k0 can go to infinity
and the magnitude of k

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.670 align:middle line:90%
can also go to infinity.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.380 align:middle line:90%


00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.000 align:middle line:90%
So we include those regions.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.950 align:middle line:84%
So you have this infinite
range of integrals,

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.450 align:middle line:84%
then there's a possibility
you get divergence.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.200 align:middle line:84%
There is a possibility
you get divergence.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the
divergence does happen

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.390 align:middle line:90%
and happened almost everywhere.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you look
at loop diagrams,

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.200 align:middle line:84%
you always, essentially
always, find the divergences.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.160 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:18.470 align:middle line:90%
So this leads to divergences.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:24.150 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And such divergences are
now more complicated.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not like the
simple divergences.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.050 align:middle line:84%
We already considered,
we've already

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.570 align:middle line:84%
seen where is
divergent quantities,

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.640 align:middle line:84%
and so far those
divergent quantities

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.620 align:middle line:84%
can be treated in a
more or less simple way.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:46.390 align:middle line:84%
So we add or subtract
the infinite constant

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:49.480 align:middle line:84%
or you multiply by
the infinite constant.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of when you
multiply by infinite constant,

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.220 align:middle line:84%
you can always take
the ratio and then

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.720 align:middle line:84%
those infinite
constants go away.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Or you can just subtract
the infinite constant,

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:02.730 align:middle line:84%
redefine your energy, redefine
your charge, et cetera.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.527 align:middle line:84%
But in those diagrams,
the divergences

00:11:04.527 --> 00:11:06.110 align:middle line:84%
are much more
complicated because they

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:11.820 align:middle line:84%
come from doing some integration
of some complicated expression.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And so those divergences cannot
be simply removed where you

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.950 align:middle line:84%
just add the constant,
or remove a constant,

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.195 align:middle line:90%
or just multiply by a factor.

00:11:18.195 --> 00:11:20.740 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And so they actually
cannot be removed.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.560 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:39.660 align:middle line:84%
In general, cannot be removed
simply by say subtractions.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Removed by simple
subtractions or divisions.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:59.240 align:middle line:90%


00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.920 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
the expression

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.660 align:middle line:84%
you get from doing
such integration just

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.500 align:middle line:90%
don't make sense.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.020 align:middle line:90%


00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:19.258 align:middle line:84%
So the results from these
diagrams are not well-defined.

00:12:19.258 --> 00:12:35.920 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.030 align:middle line:84%
So the result is
not well-defined.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:47.580 align:middle line:84%
So normally when we
encounter divergences,

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:51.060 align:middle line:84%
we always tell a student
we encounter divergences

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:55.980 align:middle line:84%
of course, one obvious reason
is that you did something wrong.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:59.250 align:middle line:90%
You just made a mistake.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.890 align:middle line:84%
But if you have done
everything right,

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:84%
when you encounter divergences,
actually that's an opportunity.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.458 align:middle line:84%
Because each time
you see a divergence,

00:13:07.458 --> 00:13:09.000 align:middle line:84%
then that means
there's something you

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.600 align:middle line:90%
don't understand about physics.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.240 align:middle line:84%
If you understand, by
definition, in physics

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.020 align:middle line:84%
you do not have divergences, if
you understand everything well.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And so divergence is
mathematics telling you

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.080 align:middle line:84%
there's some important
physics you're missing.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:30.960 align:middle line:90%


00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.460 align:middle line:84%
So when you look
at this divergence,

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.540 align:middle line:84%
you can say, oh, what
physics are we missing here?

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.270 align:middle line:84%
So the physics missing
here is very simple.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:84%
The physics missing
here is very simple.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Because these integrals,
because the divergent region

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.437 align:middle line:84%
corresponding to those
quantities go to infinity,

00:13:49.437 --> 00:13:51.020 align:middle line:84%
so those quantities
go to the infinity

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:53.010 align:middle line:84%
because one is you
have very high energy,

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:54.005 align:middle line:90%
very large momentum.

00:13:54.005 --> 00:13:57.800 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:03.580 align:middle line:84%
In other words, from very
short distance physics.

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:07.030 align:middle line:84%
But very short,
that comes from--

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.470 align:middle line:90%


00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So divergences come from
naive extrapolation.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:28.100 align:middle line:90%


00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:42.240 align:middle line:84%
They say consider QED to
arbitrarily high energy scales.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:48.900 align:middle line:90%


00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Because we used the
framework of QED

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:57.110 align:middle line:84%
but when we do this integration
involving very large momentum.

00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.380 align:middle line:84%
But nobody actually tells us
that a QED should be valid

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.980 align:middle line:84%
at not very high energies
because the real experiment you

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:09.710 align:middle line:84%
cannot probe very high energy
process or very short distance

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:13.780 align:middle line:84%
because it's the limit
of our energy resolution.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.760 align:middle line:84%
So there's no reason
to trust actually QED

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:22.280 align:middle line:84%
should be valid for k
0 and k to infinity.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.780 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is the divergence
the result of the problem

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.730 align:middle line:90%
in the perturbative expansion?

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Or is it a problem with
the original [INAUDIBLE]??

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.500 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah,
it's not a feature

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.000 align:middle line:90%
of the perturbative expansion.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.550 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So it's a
legitimate problem.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:43.300 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, it's
a legitimate problem.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:48.440 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.668 align:middle line:84%
So this divergence just
comes from we extrapolate QED

00:15:51.668 --> 00:15:53.085 align:middle line:84%
to arbitrary higher
energy scales.

00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:56.270 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:01.770 align:middle line:84%
So you say, OK,
then what do we do?

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:02.880 align:middle line:90%
Then what do we do?

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:09.530 align:middle line:84%
So the simplest thing you can
do you say, I only can measure

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:15.170 align:middle line:84%
suppose in the 1930s when people
first encountered this problem.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And you say, OK, and then
let's put the cutoff.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Here let's only include
the energy regime

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.835 align:middle line:90%
which we can access.

00:16:25.835 --> 00:16:29.460 align:middle line:90%


00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:34.110 align:middle line:84%
But again, what cutoff
do you put here?

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's not clear what kind
of cutoff you put there.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:40.170 align:middle line:84%
What is the validity
of this theory?

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So ideally you should
put a cutoff there

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:50.820 align:middle line:84%
to add the boundary of
the validity of the QED.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.790 align:middle line:84%
But before you actually
can probe the scale

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle line:90%
which QED breaks down.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.690 align:middle line:90%
Which scale should we put there?

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:00.690 align:middle line:90%
So we don't know.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:04.819 align:middle line:84%
So for many years,
people thought

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:08.060 align:middle line:84%
just doing these
kinds of diagrams

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.359 align:middle line:84%
just doesn't make physical
sense because we don't know

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:13.800 align:middle line:90%
the short distance physics.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.200 align:middle line:84%
We don't know the
short distance physics.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, this point
of view was justified.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:30.080 align:middle line:84%
So for some years people
just gave up on these ideas.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.890 align:middle line:84%
They just said, maybe
this does not make sense.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:39.520 align:middle line:84%
But then after the Second
World War in the late 40s,

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.370 align:middle line:84%
a few young physicists
at the time,

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Schwinger, Feynman in the United
States and Tomonaga in Japan,

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:53.470 align:middle line:84%
they actually say,
OK, even though there

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.830 align:middle line:84%
are these kinds of
divergences, and even though we

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:59.110 align:middle line:84%
don't understand the
short distance physics,

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:03.070 align:middle line:84%
let's see whether we can
just use brute force,

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:07.150 align:middle line:84%
try to design some
mathematical way to get rid

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.550 align:middle line:84%
of those divergences,
and see whether I

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:12.540 align:middle line:90%
can get sensible results.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
their starting point,

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.430 align:middle line:84%
and that was their
starting point.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was a crazy
starting point

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.020 align:middle line:84%
because of the physical
reason for those divergences

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.090 align:middle line:90%
are very clear.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:27.540 align:middle line:84%
But then it turned
out that they actually

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.030 align:middle line:90%
managed to be successful.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So in the late 1940s
people found the method.

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:49.240 align:middle line:84%
So Feynman, Schwinger,
and Tomonaga

00:18:49.240 --> 00:19:13.750 align:middle line:84%
managed to find a way to
remove the divergences

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:31.595 align:middle line:84%
and create a physically sensible
answer from such diagrams.

00:19:31.595 --> 00:19:39.990 align:middle line:90%


00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And also, at the
beginning, their work

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.610 align:middle line:84%
was very complicated and
very few people actually

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.110 align:middle line:90%
understood them.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And then Feynman used
Feynman diagrams,

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.710 align:middle line:84%
so he invented the Feynman
diagrams to do this.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Because previously people
do those calculations.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.380 align:middle line:84%
They don't use Feynman diagrams
and they use very complicated

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.110 align:middle line:84%
perturbation
theory, as you do in

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.390 align:middle line:90%
the long relativistic physics.

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:08.580 align:middle line:84%
It's very complicated,
and actually that's

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.340 align:middle line:84%
what the Schwinger and the
Tomonaga they were doing.

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.940 align:middle line:84%
So at the beginning, this
thing was very complicated,

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:19.770 align:middle line:84%
but then Freeman Dyson
soon afterwards, he

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:23.630 align:middle line:84%
understood all their work and
actually greatly simplified

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:25.260 align:middle line:90%
the process.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the
current understanding

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.630 align:middle line:84%
essentially came from
the simplification

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:31.950 align:middle line:90%
of the Freeman Dyson.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And the Freeman Dyson actually
operated a Feynman diagram fact

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:35.910 align:middle line:90%
--

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Feynman diagram training --

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.660 align:middle line:84%
essentially operated the Feynman
diagram training at camp,

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.040 align:middle line:84%
at the institute for advanced
study when he was a member.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So people went through
there, they all

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.210 align:middle line:84%
learned this Feynman diagram
techniques from Freeman Dyson,

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:53.970 align:middle line:84%
and then they spread it
out to all other places.

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:57.900 align:middle line:84%
That's how Feynman diagram
techniques got spread out

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.790 align:middle line:90%
in the physical community.

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, so Freeman Dyson,
he simplified the process,

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:09.900 align:middle line:84%
and then people
eventually understood.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And there is a well-defined
mathematical procedure

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.810 align:middle line:84%
you can actually get
rid of those divergences

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and get a physically
sensible answer.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.270 align:middle line:90%
And so it was a funny story.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:27.110 align:middle line:90%


00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:29.722 align:middle line:84%
This is called the program
of renormalization.

00:21:29.722 --> 00:21:32.490 align:middle line:90%


00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:35.370 align:middle line:84%
The process of getting
rid of the divergences.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:41.720 align:middle line:90%


00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.890 align:middle line:90%
And this is a funny story.

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:51.120 align:middle line:84%
It's because, as I said,
there's a very physical--

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.510 align:middle line:84%
This is a very funny story
for the following reason.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:59.880 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, we do know
where the divergences come from.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Divergences come from our lack
understanding of short distance

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:04.100 align:middle line:90%
physics.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And normally you believe you
can only cure the divergence

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:10.400 align:middle line:90%
if you understand that physics.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.020 align:middle line:84%
If you don't understand
that physics,

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.170 align:middle line:90%
how you cure that divergence?

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:17.700 align:middle line:84%
So that's what most people
thought at the time,

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.690 align:middle line:84%
including all these quantum
mechanics big shots.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:24.740 align:middle line:84%
All these old people,
like Dirac, Pauli,

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:27.020 align:middle line:84%
all those giants of
quantum mechanics.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:31.880 align:middle line:84%
They all believed you have to
do something radical to QED,

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.755 align:middle line:84%
otherwise QED cannot
be made sense.

00:22:33.755 --> 00:22:37.070 align:middle line:84%
You have to invent some
completely new formalism

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:41.420 align:middle line:84%
to circumvent those
divergences exactly.

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:48.930 align:middle line:84%
But then Dyson later commented
that those young people at

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:51.810 align:middle line:84%
the time they said
we were conservative.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.153 align:middle line:84%
We want you just to look
at those calculations

00:22:54.153 --> 00:22:56.070 align:middle line:84%
just want to make sense
of those calculations.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:58.110 align:middle line:84%
We don't think of
those grand physics.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:00.330 align:middle line:84%
I just want to make sense
of those calculations,

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:02.040 align:middle line:90%
and then they succeeded.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So this is an example in
which very old people,

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.830 align:middle line:84%
they want to do
grand new physics,

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:10.350 align:middle line:84%
but young people wanted to
do conservative physics, just

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:15.020 align:middle line:84%
two calculations, one
calculation at a time

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:18.390 align:middle line:84%
without clear
physical motivation.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.330 align:middle line:84%
But those young people
turned out to be correct,

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.700 align:middle line:84%
and so they came up
with this program.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:28.860 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So
[INAUDIBLE] resolve is

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:33.380 align:middle line:84%
more accurate than the
tree-level diagram?

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.467 align:middle line:90%
And then how much more accurate?

00:23:35.467 --> 00:23:37.050 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: No, it's
not about accuracy.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:41.880 align:middle line:84%
It's about finding a sensible
way to hide the divergences.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.325 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:44.325 --> 00:23:44.950 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:47.987 align:middle line:90%


00:23:47.987 --> 00:23:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Because today we will not be
able to go into the detail.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to only
tell you the result.

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:57.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's why their result was
actually radical in some way.

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Because they realized
there is some way somehow

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:04.290 align:middle line:84%
those divergences,
even they are there,

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:07.560 align:middle line:84%
they do not affect
those observable physics

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:11.570 align:middle line:90%
you can measure.

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:13.410 align:middle line:90%
They don't affect those things.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:16.160 align:middle line:84%
So you can find some
mathematical trick

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.840 align:middle line:90%
to remove them.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:27.550 align:middle line:90%


00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:30.970 align:middle line:84%
But for many years, so
after they succeeded,

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:34.270 align:middle line:84%
so this is late 1940s,
and the Dyson was also

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:39.670 align:middle line:90%
late 1940s, early 1950.

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And then as I'm going to mention
at the end of today's lecture,

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:51.400 align:middle line:84%
the first calculated quantity is
this anomalous magnetic moment,

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:56.240 align:middle line:84%
which now requires doing
a calculation of this one.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Doing a calculation of
this one and Schwinger

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.240 align:middle line:90%
did the first calculation.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And then he calculated
the correction of this

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:09.040 align:middle line:84%
to the magnetic
moment of electron.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And that agreed very
well with experiments,

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:15.280 align:middle line:84%
so that was a
triumph at the time.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So the experiment
verified their success.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.790 align:middle line:84%
But still, many people
didn't believe this actually

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:26.948 align:middle line:90%
was something sensible.

00:25:26.948 --> 00:25:28.740 align:middle line:84%
For many years, people
thought this is just

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:32.890 align:middle line:84%
a mathematical trick
to get some answer.

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And so many people
still, for many years

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.800 align:middle line:84%
people were doubting this
program of renormalization.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And then only much later
in late 1960s or 1970s,

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.720 align:middle line:84%
when Ken Wilson came
up with this idea

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.450 align:middle line:84%
called renormalization
group, and then

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:58.140 align:middle line:84%
people finally understood
the physical reasoning

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.540 align:middle line:84%
and the physical basis
behind this program

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:01.875 align:middle line:90%
of renormalization.

00:26:01.875 --> 00:26:04.560 align:middle line:90%


00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:12.180 align:middle line:84%
So that was a revolutionary
progress made by Wilson.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So all this will be covered in
detail in Quantum Field Theory

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:21.605 align:middle line:90%
II.

00:26:21.605 --> 00:26:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And so today let me just
very quickly tell you

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:30.470 align:middle line:84%
what these three
loop diagrams do.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:33.270 align:middle line:90%


00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:37.470 align:middle line:84%
So first let me make
some general remarks.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.260 align:middle line:84%
So mathematically,
you get divergences

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:46.890 align:middle line:84%
and then you have to find a way
to get rid of the divergences.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.975 align:middle line:84%
And physically, there are
also some new features.

00:26:48.975 --> 00:26:53.393 align:middle line:90%


00:26:53.393 --> 00:26:54.810 align:middle line:84%
New important
conceptual features.

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:57.930 align:middle line:90%


00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:59.190 align:middle line:90%
So any questions on this?

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:02.130 align:middle line:90%


00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:15.240 align:middle line:84%
So the first feature,
I already mentioned.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.230 align:middle line:90%
We include such loops.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:31.740 align:middle line:84%
You essentially include
the quantum fluctuations

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:32.340 align:middle line:90%
of the vacuum.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:37.450 align:middle line:90%


00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:42.390 align:middle line:84%
So all this process, so that
electron pair, that photon,

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:44.970 align:middle line:84%
and that photon they all
some virtual particle

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:50.650 align:middle line:84%
just come from the vacuum, just
from the vacuum fluctuations.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:56.727 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually show
mathematically rigorously.

00:27:56.727 --> 00:27:57.935 align:middle line:90%
That the tree-level diagrams.

00:27:57.935 --> 00:28:01.370 align:middle line:90%


00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Any tree-level diagrams
can be obtained

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:28.827 align:middle line:84%
from solving your equation
of motion perturbatively.

00:28:28.827 --> 00:28:40.770 align:middle line:90%


00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:45.420 align:middle line:84%
So just take your nonlinear
equation of motion,

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.930 align:middle line:84%
take the QED, you write down the
nonlinear equation of motion,

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:50.803 align:middle line:84%
and then you have
this coupling, e,

00:28:50.803 --> 00:28:53.220 align:middle line:84%
and then you just solve that
equation perturbatively order

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.150 align:middle line:90%
by order.

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And now all tree-level
diagrams can be

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.650 align:middle line:90%
understood from that process.

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Essentially just
coming from solving

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.900 align:middle line:90%
your equation of motion.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.990 align:middle line:84%
But then we know that
the quantum nature comes

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.270 align:middle line:90%
from doing the path integral.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Equation of motion captures
some classical physics,

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.960 align:middle line:84%
but the genuine
quantum physics come

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.940 align:middle line:84%
from doing the classic
path integral, which

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:23.040 align:middle line:84%
you integrate over all
possible configurations.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.290 align:middle line:90%
And so that is not captured.

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:26.930 align:middle line:84%
So those features
of path integral

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:28.722 align:middle line:84%
are not captured by
the tree-level diagram.

00:29:28.722 --> 00:29:30.850 align:middle line:90%


00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:33.760 align:middle line:84%
But you may ask, does
tree-level diagram actually

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.170 align:middle line:90%
capture any quantum physics?

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:36.250 align:middle line:90%
Of course it does.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:40.330 align:middle line:84%
It does capture quantum
physics because all this notion

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:42.490 align:middle line:84%
of the particles,
even the notion

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:46.530 align:middle line:84%
of quantizing the
particles, that's already

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:49.480 align:middle line:90%
included in the quantum effect.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.118 align:middle line:84%
Just the tree-level diagram does
not include the fluctuations

00:29:53.118 --> 00:29:53.785 align:middle line:90%
from the vacuum.

00:29:53.785 --> 00:29:57.650 align:middle line:90%


00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:59.450 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
the first feature.

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So when you include the
loop, you actually now

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.090 align:middle line:84%
finally include the
quantum fluctuations.

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And the second feature,
it's very important,

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:29.490 align:middle line:84%
is that the physical mass
charge and the physical fields

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:46.285 align:middle line:84%
are not the same as that
appearing in the Lagrangian.

00:30:46.285 --> 00:30:54.660 align:middle line:90%


00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.800 align:middle line:84%
So let me elaborate
what this means.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:00.510 align:middle line:84%
So remember, when we write
down the Lagrangian for QED,

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:07.230 align:middle line:84%
you have i psi bar gamma
mu partial mu minus i

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:20.040 align:middle line:84%
e A mu psi minus m psi minus
one half one quarter F squared.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.790 align:middle line:90%
So that's Lagrangian.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And then we say that this is
the charge of the electron,

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and this is the mass
of the electron,

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and this psi denotes
the electron field.

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Means that when you
acted on the vacuum,

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.250 align:middle line:84%
you can create the
electron or anti electron.

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, A mu
because A mu is massless,

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.690 align:middle line:84%
and when A mu acting
on the vacuum,

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:51.550 align:middle line:90%
it can create the photon.

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:54.700 align:middle line:90%


00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Turns out when you
include the loop effect,

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:01.410 align:middle line:90%
the mass we actually measure.

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:03.950 align:middle line:84%
So by physical
mass, means the mass

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:06.650 align:middle line:84%
of the electron we actually
measure in the lab,

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:09.620 align:middle line:84%
and the charge we actually
measure in the lab.

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:13.390 align:middle line:84%
They are no longer
the same as the one

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:15.420 align:middle line:90%
appearing in the Lagrangian.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.550 align:middle line:84%
So the y in the Lagrangian
should be just viewed

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:19.610 align:middle line:90%
as some kind of parameter.

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And so and the geophysical
mass and the charge

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:28.190 align:middle line:84%
are functions of
those parameters.

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a more
complicated relation

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.755 align:middle line:84%
between those parameters
and your physical mass

00:32:32.755 --> 00:32:33.380 align:middle line:90%
and the charge.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:36.120 align:middle line:90%


00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Also, the physical field, which
actually creates the electron,

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:43.520 align:middle line:84%
is no longer directly
given by this psi.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.325 align:middle line:84%
It's related by psi
by some relation.

00:32:45.325 --> 00:32:48.880 align:middle line:90%


00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:53.640 align:middle line:84%
So this difference is also
called renormalization.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:57.870 align:middle line:90%


00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:02.790 align:middle line:84%
So here this true sense
of renormalization,

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:04.650 align:middle line:84%
which is actually
used for completely

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:08.800 align:middle line:90%
two different contexts.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.460 align:middle line:84%
So this renormalization
just means the removal

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:14.520 align:middle line:84%
of the divergences, and
this renormalization

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:20.250 align:middle line:84%
means the parameters
in your Lagrangian

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:23.160 align:middle line:84%
may not be the same as the
physical mass and the charge

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.350 align:middle line:90%
you measure.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.240 align:middle line:84%
So the thing you
measure actually

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.250 align:middle line:84%
it's related to the
parameters in the Lagrangian

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:31.270 align:middle line:90%
in a non-trivial way.

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And this renormalization
is in principle

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:36.910 align:middle line:90%
not due to the divergence.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:38.470 align:middle line:84%
It's just due to
the interactions.

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:43.520 align:middle line:90%


00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.660 align:middle line:84%
So heuristically the
physical is as follows--

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:50.060 align:middle line:84%
just imagine you
have a free electron.

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:55.130 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a free
electron, and then

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:59.450 align:middle line:84%
the mass of the electron,
then it is what you measure.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:03.050 align:middle line:84%
But now if you include the
interactions, and now electron

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:05.570 align:middle line:84%
can interact with the
photon in a complicated way,

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:08.293 align:middle line:84%
and that interaction
then can change

00:34:08.293 --> 00:34:09.335 align:middle line:90%
the mass of the electron.

00:34:09.335 --> 00:34:12.260 align:middle line:90%


00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:17.989 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, in general
for interacting theory, what

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:21.620 align:middle line:84%
appears in your
Lagrangian, they don't

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:25.949 align:middle line:84%
have to be the quantity
you actually measure.

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:29.429 align:middle line:84%
Because the
interactions can change

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:31.260 align:middle line:84%
how you translate
those quantities

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:33.929 align:middle line:84%
into the physical
quantities you measure.

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:39.423 align:middle line:90%


00:34:39.423 --> 00:34:40.840 align:middle line:84%
So this renormalization
just means

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:46.030 align:middle line:84%
the renormalization changes
the value of your parameters.

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:51.310 align:middle line:90%


00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:53.882 align:middle line:84%
So now let me just make this
a little bit more explicit.

00:34:53.882 --> 00:34:55.840 align:middle line:84%
So before I do that, do
you have any questions?

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:35:02.350 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] looking
at QED by itself [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:04.950 align:middle line:84%
any other theories,
wouldn't we have

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:10.030 align:middle line:84%
to assume that this parameter m
corresponds to a physical mass?

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:16.310 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] how we
say [INAUDIBLE]..

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:18.020 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying
that QED on its own

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:21.260 align:middle line:84%
has its way of explaining
how this parameter m relates

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:22.150 align:middle line:90%
to the physical m?

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:26.295 align:middle line:90%


00:35:26.295 --> 00:35:30.480 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, so when I write
down this Lagrangian and then

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:34.940 align:middle line:84%
I have parameters
here for the e and m,

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:40.480 align:middle line:84%
so if I ignore the
interaction, then the m

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:44.630 align:middle line:84%
will be the mass of the
particle you actually measure.

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:46.730 align:middle line:84%
But now when you
include the interaction,

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:50.850 align:middle line:84%
then the interaction
can change that mass.

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:54.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not related
to the Higgs story.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:58.510 align:middle line:84%
The Higgs explains
where this m comes from.

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Hicks explains where this
parameter comes from.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.890 align:middle line:84%
So this is a renormalization
on top of that.

00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:09.040 align:middle line:90%


00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:09.830 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:12.560 align:middle line:84%
So now let me just
elaborate what this means.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:16.220 align:middle line:90%


00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:20.420 align:middle line:84%
So for this purpose now
let me put a subscript B

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:25.403 align:middle line:84%
here on everything
just to emphasize

00:36:25.403 --> 00:36:26.445 align:middle line:90%
that they are no longer--

00:36:26.445 --> 00:36:29.958 align:middle line:90%


00:36:29.958 --> 00:36:31.250 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Can I ask a question?

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:31.875 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:36:31.875 --> 00:36:34.610 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:52.490 align:middle line:90%


00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:54.608 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, it
changes the energy you

00:36:54.608 --> 00:36:55.775 align:middle line:90%
need to create the particle.

00:36:55.775 --> 00:37:01.520 align:middle line:90%


00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:05.430 align:middle line:84%
So now I denoted
everything with B,

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:07.580 align:middle line:84%
so those are called
the bare parameters.

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:19.670 align:middle line:84%
So eB is called the bare charge,
and mB called the bare mass,

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and this psi B and A mu B
is called the bare fields.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:31.560 align:middle line:90%


00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And when I write this F
square means that the F square

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:42.550 align:middle line:90%
constructed out of A mu B.

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:46.840 align:middle line:84%
So now let's just illustrate
this thing using these three

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.510 align:middle line:90%
simple diagrams.

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:55.278 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at first that
diagram, the propagation

00:37:55.278 --> 00:37:55.945 align:middle line:90%
of the electron.

00:37:55.945 --> 00:38:00.987 align:middle line:90%


00:38:00.987 --> 00:38:02.320 align:middle line:90%
The propagation of the electron.

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:07.070 align:middle line:90%


00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:15.010 align:middle line:84%
So what you need to do is
you calculate this diagram

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and then you find the
correction to the propagator.

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.580 align:middle line:84%
So this diagram will
induce a correction

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:23.200 align:middle line:84%
to the propagator
of the electron.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.840 align:middle line:90%


00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And from this correction,
then you find that the--

00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:32.050 align:middle line:90%


00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:37.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's first write down
the tree-level propagator.

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:48.690 align:middle line:90%


00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:57.090 align:middle line:84%
So this is given by minus 1 i
k slash minus m plus i epsilon.

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:58.100 align:middle line:90%
So this is just mB.

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:05.540 align:middle line:90%


00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:08.780 align:middle line:84%
So you can interpret
the mass of the electron

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.670 align:middle line:90%
as the pole of this k.

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So when k is equal to mB
and then that corresponding

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:16.790 align:middle line:90%
to the mass of the electron.

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And the mass of the
electron corresponding

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:22.250 align:middle line:90%
to the pole of this propagator.

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.760 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: What does
it mean [INAUDIBLE]??

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:30.710 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, what I mean
is just when you invert it,

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:36.260 align:middle line:84%
this becomes k squared plus
m squared minus i epsilon.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.510 align:middle line:84%
It just means k
squared equals this.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:42.530 align:middle line:84%
So upstairs we have
k slash plus m.

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:45.650 align:middle line:84%
It just means k
squared plus m square.

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Just essentially
the mass electron

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:52.870 align:middle line:84%
corresponding to the
pole of the propagator.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:55.880 align:middle line:84%
So now when you include
such corrections,

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:59.000 align:middle line:84%
then you find your
propagator modified

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.100 align:middle line:90%
into the following thing--

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:08.780 align:middle line:84%
Z divided by i k slash minus
some other mass plus epsilon.

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And then now this m mass
is no longer the same.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:23.690 align:middle line:84%
So this physical mass, it's now
just mB plus some correction.

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:24.935 align:middle line:90%
So this is a physical mass.

00:40:24.935 --> 00:40:38.980 align:middle line:90%


00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:44.340 align:middle line:84%
So this tells you that the
mass of the electron when

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:45.840 align:middle line:84%
included such
diagram actually gets

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:49.790 align:middle line:90%
shifted from your bare mass.

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:53.260 align:middle line:90%


00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:56.290 align:middle line:84%
So if we calculate
it and then you

00:40:56.290 --> 00:41:00.160 align:middle line:84%
find the contribution
of this diagram

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:02.530 align:middle line:84%
is infinite and so that's
why you need to include

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:03.880 align:middle line:90%
this renormalization.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And then to calculate the
finite quantity of this delta m.

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:12.440 align:middle line:90%


00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:17.520 align:middle line:84%
So you find that the pole
of the propagator changed.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.850 align:middle line:84%
You also find actually
the residue also changed.

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:23.810 align:middle line:90%
So here the residue just 1.

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Here the residue becomes
some other constant Z. So

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:38.480 align:middle line:84%
that means that when you
act psi B on the vacuum,

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:42.410 align:middle line:84%
you no longer
create just the k--

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:44.840 align:middle line:84%
here I'm just writing
schematically--

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:49.290 align:middle line:84%
you're actually creating
square root of Z times k

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:51.840 align:middle line:90%
OK because of the prefactor.

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:55.770 align:middle line:84%
So remember, our previous psi
B is equal to a dagger etc.,

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:58.410 align:middle line:84%
when you act on the 0 you
will create a particle

00:41:58.410 --> 00:41:59.820 align:middle line:90%
normalized in a certain way.

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.910 align:middle line:84%
But now with this
Z factor, and now

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:11.220 align:middle line:84%
you create a lot of the
factor now with a prefactor Z.

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So we normally define
the physical field

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:23.760 align:middle line:84%
as the one which psi, when you
act on the vacuum, which just

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.170 align:middle line:90%
precisely created the state.

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:29.620 align:middle line:90%


00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And so now there's a
relation between this bear

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:34.015 align:middle line:90%
field and the physical field.

00:42:34.015 --> 00:42:36.880 align:middle line:90%


00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And now there's a relation
between the bear field

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:40.800 align:middle line:84%
and physical field
through this factor.

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:46.850 align:middle line:90%


00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So this tells you that the
magnitude of the field itself

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:56.245 align:middle line:90%
also get renormalized.

00:42:56.245 --> 00:42:59.890 align:middle line:90%


00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:02.120 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:06.450 align:middle line:84%
So the similar thing is
happening for the photon case.

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:10.620 align:middle line:84%
So if you consider
this process, so this

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.560 align:middle line:84%
corresponded to a modification
to the photon propagator.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:24.640 align:middle line:90%


00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:27.940 align:middle line:84%
So this created a propagation
to the photon propagator.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:33.330 align:middle line:84%
So now you find that actually
the photon mass is not changed.

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:35.150 align:middle line:84%
So even when you include
such corrections,

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.720 align:middle line:90%
the photon is still massless.

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:42.120 align:middle line:84%
So remember, previously we
say why you cannot add a mass

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.050 align:middle line:90%
to a photon?

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:51.960 align:middle line:84%
So remember why we cannot add a
mass term to the Maxwell field?

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.180 align:middle line:90%
The guage invariance.

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that the mass cannot
be generated by such correction

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:02.910 align:middle line:84%
just means that the gauge
symmetry is maintained,

00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:04.515 align:middle line:90%
so the photon remains massless.

00:44:04.515 --> 00:44:13.180 align:middle line:90%


00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:16.960 align:middle line:84%
But you do have similar
renormalization of the strength

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:19.450 align:middle line:90%
of the Maxwell field.

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:28.500 align:middle line:84%
So now the bare field is
related to your physical field

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:32.635 align:middle line:84%
through some factor
normally called Z3.

00:44:32.635 --> 00:44:36.050 align:middle line:90%


00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:36.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:39.620 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:42.500 align:middle line:90%


00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.090 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, this
just a constant.

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:48.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, this is just a constant.

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:56.440 align:middle line:90%


00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:59.010 align:middle line:84%
So this is defined
to be the residue

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:02.151 align:middle line:90%
of the pole of the propagator.

00:45:02.151 --> 00:45:06.000 align:middle line:90%


00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:11.210 align:middle line:84%
So finally, let me mention a
little bit the last diagram.

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:31.420 align:middle line:90%


00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:34.530 align:middle line:84%
So this last diagram, which
I will redraw it here.

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:41.760 align:middle line:90%


00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So remember, if you just
have the original one,

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:51.195 align:middle line:90%
then here is just i eB gamma mu.

00:45:51.195 --> 00:45:53.920 align:middle line:90%


00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And now when you add
such a correction,

00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:59.980 align:middle line:84%
so this is the tree-level one
and then at one loop level

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:01.580 align:middle line:90%
you can add such a thing.

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And when you add such
a thing, then you

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:07.060 align:middle line:90%
renormalize the charge.

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:09.910 align:middle line:90%
Then the charge gets changed.

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So now you find interestingly
that the new electric charge is

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:19.670 align:middle line:90%
related.

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:23.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is the measured
charge, physical charge.

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:28.215 align:middle line:90%


00:46:28.215 --> 00:46:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Through a complicated
calculation

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:36.320 align:middle line:84%
you find this physical charge
is related to the bare charge

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:40.310 align:middle line:84%
by the same factor,
Z3, as in the case

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:45.350 align:middle line:84%
of the relation
between the bare field

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:48.050 align:middle line:90%
and the renormalized field.

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:50.420 align:middle line:84%
You find that the
same number that

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:52.933 align:middle line:84%
appears in the relation between
the physical electron charge

00:46:52.933 --> 00:46:53.975 align:middle line:90%
and then the bare charge.

00:46:53.975 --> 00:46:59.770 align:middle line:90%


00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:04.550 align:middle line:84%
So this is important for
the following reason.

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:13.590 align:middle line:84%
So now you observe because
of these two relation,

00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:24.490 align:middle line:84%
that eB A mu B is
actually equal to e A mu.

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:29.930 align:middle line:84%
So the product here is the
same because the square root 3

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:30.635 align:middle line:90%
factor cancels.

00:47:30.635 --> 00:47:38.950 align:middle line:90%


00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:40.090 align:middle line:90%
And this is important.

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Because of this, that means your
covariant derivative does not

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:49.060 align:middle line:90%
change.

00:47:49.060 --> 00:48:05.310 align:middle line:90%


00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:09.830 align:middle line:84%
So remember, the structure
of this covariant derivative

00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:13.400 align:middle line:84%
is needed for the
gauge invariance.

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:17.150 align:middle line:84%
It's needed for the
gauge invariance.

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:20.510 align:middle line:84%
So that this is
maintained, again,

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:26.550 align:middle line:84%
is an implication that the
gauge symmetry is maintained.

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:29.670 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you
want to say that if we

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:34.350 align:middle line:84%
want to maintain the gauge
symmetry, then eB and A mu B,

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:36.640 align:middle line:84%
they have to renormalize
in the opposite way

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:37.860 align:middle line:90%
so that this is the same.

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:43.990 align:middle line:90%


00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:46.900 align:middle line:90%
So this diagram has two effects.

00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:50.500 align:middle line:90%


00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:54.400 align:middle line:84%
One effect is correct
the electric charge.

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And another effect is
generate the magnetic moment.

00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Generate an anomalous
magnetic moment.

00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:02.410 align:middle line:90%
So this has two effects.

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:05.560 align:middle line:84%
The first effect
is to renormalize,

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:09.910 align:middle line:84%
to change your charge,
and the second effect

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:15.555 align:middle line:84%
is generate an anomalous
magnetic moment.

00:49:15.555 --> 00:49:33.790 align:middle line:90%


00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:41.695 align:middle line:84%
So you may have learned
in your quantum mechanics

00:49:41.695 --> 00:49:55.210 align:middle line:84%
that e minus has a magnetic
moment, which is normally

00:49:55.210 --> 00:50:00.220 align:middle line:84%
written as following--
mu e equal to minus e

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:05.960 align:middle line:84%
divided by 2m g and
the spin operator.

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Just because the electron
has spin, spin half,

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:10.700 align:middle line:90%
and so it has a magnetic moment.

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And this spin half
of course is normally

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:17.540 align:middle line:90%
written this spin operator.

00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:20.810 align:middle line:84%
It's in the spin half space,
then just a sigma matrix.

00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:23.630 align:middle line:90%


00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And this g factor, so
this is a g factor which

00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:31.340 align:middle line:90%
relates the g, just a number.

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:32.700 align:middle line:90%
g is just a number.

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:33.990 align:middle line:90%
So normally called g factor--

00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:41.180 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
diagrammatic expansion

00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:44.630 align:middle line:84%
of the perturbation theory
in powers of lambda.

00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:49.400 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying you add a term
and you change e with the --

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:53.480 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, the e
can change itself Yeah.

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:58.610 align:middle line:84%
So you just shift
the value of e right.

00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:02.140 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:05.590 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah,
change is also small.

00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:06.870 align:middle line:90%
The change is a higher order.

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:09.930 align:middle line:90%


00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:13.150 align:middle line:84%
But this is a very
good question.

00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:15.510 align:middle line:84%
This is a very good question
because, as I mentioned,

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:18.190 align:middle line:84%
naively if you look
at those corrections,

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:25.240 align:middle line:84%
say this delta m and this
change between e and eB,

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:27.360 align:middle line:90%
they are all divergent.

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:31.463 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they're
all very complicated.

00:51:31.463 --> 00:51:32.880 align:middle line:84%
These are all
divergent, so that's

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:37.110 align:middle line:84%
why it's non-trivial to
find a scheme to make

00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:38.990 align:middle line:90%
sense of those equations.

00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:43.573 align:middle line:84%
But we'll have all those
divergences flying around.

00:51:43.573 --> 00:51:44.240 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:47.475 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: What is the difference
between square root of Z

00:51:47.475 --> 00:51:48.753 align:middle line:90%
and the square root of Z3?

00:51:48.753 --> 00:51:49.420 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:51.311 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: What is the difference
between square root of Z

00:51:51.311 --> 00:51:52.060 align:middle line:90%
and the square root of Z3?

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:54.220 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Oh, they're
just different numbers.

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:57.040 align:middle line:84%
So this is one number,
this is some other number.

00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Just the electron field
renormalized in a different way

00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:04.000 align:middle line:84%
from the photon, but
somehow the charge

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.310 align:middle line:84%
has to be renormalized
in the same way.

00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:09.740 align:middle line:90%


00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:11.210 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:30.210 align:middle line:90%


00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:36.540 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, but
that come out from--

00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:42.213 align:middle line:84%
It comes out from
the gauge symmetry,

00:52:42.213 --> 00:52:43.880 align:middle line:84%
from the requirements
of gauge symmetry.

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:47.740 align:middle line:90%


00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:49.540 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:52:49.540 --> 00:53:00.520 align:middle line:84%
So this g factor, so one of the
triumphs of the Dirac equation,

00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:02.830 align:middle line:84%
when Dirac first
wrote it down, it

00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:09.100 align:middle line:84%
said the Dirac equation
predicts that g equals to 2.

00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:15.040 align:middle line:90%


00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:21.238 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, in the
late 30s and early 40s,

00:53:21.238 --> 00:53:22.780 align:middle line:84%
the experiments were
accurate enough.

00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:25.210 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning, people
thought that g equals to 2,

00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:28.420 align:middle line:84%
so that was considered to be a
triumph of the Dirac equation.

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:30.010 align:middle line:84%
But then later,
when the experiment

00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:33.550 align:middle line:84%
became more accurate, they
find that g is actually

00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:34.960 align:middle line:90%
slightly greater than 2.

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:41.200 align:middle line:90%


00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Of course, this
accuracy is later.

00:53:45.310 --> 00:53:47.920 align:middle line:84%
At the beginning,
in the 40s, they

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.990 align:middle line:84%
can already see that
the g is no longer 2.

00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:52.720 align:middle line:90%
There's some small corrections.

00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So there was a big
question at the time--

00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:58.933 align:middle line:84%
how do you calculate
this correction?

00:53:58.933 --> 00:54:04.420 align:middle line:90%


00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:07.160 align:middle line:84%
So that amounts to
calculate this diagram.

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.920 align:middle line:90%
So that's what Schwinger did.

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And so he calculated
this diagram,

00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:13.330 align:middle line:84%
he managed to get rid
of the divergence,

00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:16.260 align:middle line:84%
and he managed to reproduce
these small corrections.

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:20.210 align:middle line:90%


00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:25.210 align:middle line:84%
So now let me just very
quickly tell you tell you

00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:26.590 align:middle line:90%
where this result comes from.

00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:29.530 align:middle line:90%


00:54:29.530 --> 00:54:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Why Dirac equation
predicts the g equal to 2.

00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:36.270 align:middle line:84%
So this actually I
had at some point

00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:40.950 align:middle line:84%
was thinking as a homework
exercise, but never got

00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:45.060 align:middle line:84%
to put it in the homework, but
it's an instructive exercise.

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And so now let me try to
explain where it comes from.

00:54:53.100 --> 00:55:03.300 align:middle line:90%


00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:04.952 align:middle line:90%
So we have the Dirac equation.

00:55:04.952 --> 00:55:06.660 align:middle line:84%
So now let's consider
the Dirac equation.

00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:15.100 align:middle line:90%


00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Of electron coupled to
the electromagnetic field.

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:24.855 align:middle line:90%
So let's consider this equation.

00:55:24.855 --> 00:55:29.830 align:middle line:90%


00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:36.550 align:middle line:84%
So the claim-- from this
equation, of course,

00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:39.540 align:middle line:84%
we don't see anything
about the magnetic moment.

00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:41.770 align:middle line:84%
We don't see anything
about the magnetic moment.

00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:45.180 align:middle line:84%
So the claim is that if you
take this equation and go

00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:51.250 align:middle line:84%
to nonrelativistic limit, if
you go to nonrelativistic limit,

00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:54.180 align:middle line:84%
you will get the
Schrodinger equation,

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:57.070 align:middle line:84%
you get the so-called
Pauli equation.

00:55:57.070 --> 00:55:59.560 align:middle line:84%
So you get the
Schrodinger equation,

00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:05.280 align:middle line:84%
and with a spin half particle
and with a magnetic moment

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.140 align:middle line:90%
precisely given by g equal to 2.

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:10.840 align:middle line:90%


00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:13.590 align:middle line:90%
So now let's try to see this.

00:56:13.590 --> 00:56:17.880 align:middle line:90%


00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:20.970 align:middle line:90%
Do you have any questions?

00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So this is just the
Dirac equation itself,

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:27.070 align:middle line:84%
but now if you include
that vertex correction,

00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:30.370 align:middle line:84%
and then that will generate
this additional term.

00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:33.820 align:middle line:90%


00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So now let's look at this
nonrelativistic limit.

00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:43.710 align:middle line:90%


00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:55.290 align:middle line:84%
So remember, the Dirac equation,
as it was originally conceived,

00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:59.820 align:middle line:84%
was already an equation
of the Schrodinger type.

00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:07.140 align:middle line:84%
So you have the form of the
i H t psi equal to H psi.

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:12.810 align:middle line:84%
So you just multiply the
i gamma 0 on both sides

00:57:12.810 --> 00:57:16.110 align:middle line:90%
and then remove everything away.

00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So just this side
keeps only i partial t.

00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:21.300 align:middle line:84%
So through this
procedure you have

00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:35.865 align:middle line:84%
H is equal to m times beta plus
alpha p plus eA then plus eA0.

00:57:35.865 --> 00:57:42.270 align:middle line:84%
eA0 is 0 component of A and eA
is the vector component of A.

00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:47.670 align:middle line:84%
So the beta is just the
minus gamma i gamma 0,

00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and alpha i is equal to minus
i gamma 0 gamma i, and the p

00:57:57.970 --> 00:58:02.770 align:middle line:84%
goes to minus i, the
standard gradient operator.

00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:05.600 align:middle line:90%


00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:07.370 align:middle line:84%
So now the claim
is that if I want

00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:10.370 align:middle line:84%
to take the
nonrelativistic limit,

00:58:10.370 --> 00:58:14.210 align:middle line:84%
this equation becomes an
ordinary Schrodinger equation,

00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:15.560 align:middle line:90%
including the magnetic moment.

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:21.210 align:middle line:90%


00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Is this clear what
we want to do?

00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So now let's choose the
basis for the gamma matrices.

00:58:28.310 --> 00:58:32.290 align:middle line:84%
So for this purpose, we go
to the nonrelativistic limit,

00:58:32.290 --> 00:58:36.040 align:middle line:84%
it's convenient to use this
basis, which actually I

00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:38.260 align:middle line:84%
wrote down at the
beginning when we talked

00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:39.880 align:middle line:90%
about the Dirac equations.

00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:48.190 align:middle line:90%


00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Again, 1 is always 2
by 2 identity matrix.

00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:59.600 align:middle line:84%
So from here, you find that
the beta just equals to 1 0

00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:07.150 align:middle line:84%
0 minus 1 and the alpha just
becomes 0 sigma sigma 0.

00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:17.890 align:middle line:90%


00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:19.480 align:middle line:90%
So to reduce--

00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Right now we just
choose then we also

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:27.140 align:middle line:84%
need to write psi in terms
of the two components.

00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So each of phi and the
chi has two components,

00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:31.030 align:middle line:90%
altogether four components.

00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:34.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's write psi in terms of
two upper components, two lower

00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:37.180 align:middle line:90%
components.

00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And now let's plug all
this into that equation.

00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:43.690 align:middle line:90%
All this into this equation.

00:59:43.690 --> 00:59:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And then we get partial
t phi equal to m

00:59:51.060 --> 01:00:02.880 align:middle line:84%
phi plus sigma dot p plus
eA chi then plus eA0 psi.

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.660 align:middle line:90%


01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And then for the
equation for chi,

01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:12.290 align:middle line:84%
you get a similar
equation, but here it's

01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:23.390 align:middle line:84%
minus m chi plus sigma dot
p plus eA phi plus eA0 chi.

01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:27.730 align:middle line:90%


01:00:27.730 --> 01:00:29.155 align:middle line:90%
So you get these two equations.

01:00:29.155 --> 01:00:32.560 align:middle line:90%


01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.990 align:middle line:84%
So now so far we
haven't done anything.

01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:39.460 align:middle line:84%
We just wrote this equation
in a different form.

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:41.505 align:middle line:84%
So now let's consider the
nonrelativistic limit.

01:00:41.505 --> 01:00:49.670 align:middle line:90%


01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Now consider the
nonrelativistic limit.

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:58.870 align:middle line:84%
So in the nonrelativistic
limit, this p

01:00:58.870 --> 01:01:02.480 align:middle line:84%
is essentially the
spatial momentum

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.520 align:middle line:90%
if you act on the wave.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.770 align:middle line:90%
And so we take it to be mv.

01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:09.610 align:middle line:90%


01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:12.085 align:middle line:84%
And of course, v to be
much, much smaller than 1.

01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:15.940 align:middle line:90%


01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And then this e A0, which
has a unit of energy,

01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:24.310 align:middle line:84%
so it should be of
order mv squared.

01:01:24.310 --> 01:01:28.520 align:middle line:90%


01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And this e A, which should
be the same order as p,

01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:38.030 align:middle line:84%
and then e A should also
be of the same order as mv.

01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:41.800 align:middle line:90%


01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And now let's look at this
nonrelativistic limit.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:49.520 align:middle line:90%


01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:50.930 align:middle line:90%
So far I have not done anything.

01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:53.660 align:middle line:90%
I just specified this.

01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And now let's consider
a transformation.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So in the
nonrelativistic limit we

01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:02.675 align:middle line:90%
know that your total energy--

01:02:02.675 --> 01:02:26.860 align:middle line:90%


01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:29.910 align:middle line:84%
So remember, a
typical wave function

01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:33.540 align:middle line:84%
is always the time
dependence, so you always

01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:39.420 align:middle line:84%
have something like iEt, and
in the nonrelativistic limit,

01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:44.370 align:middle line:84%
E would be m plus one half
mv squared, et cetera.

01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:46.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is much, much
larger than this term.

01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:53.940 align:middle line:90%


01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So we can just isolate
this bigger piece.

01:02:57.390 --> 01:03:00.000 align:middle line:84%
So we can try to
isolate this big piece,

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.970 align:middle line:84%
so we will make a
slight transformation.

01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:12.700 align:middle line:84%
So we write phi equal to
exponential minus i m t capital

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:13.730 align:middle line:90%
phi.

01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And the chi equal to i
m t x or capital chi.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:29.150 align:middle line:84%
So now this will only
contain this low energy part,

01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:31.250 align:middle line:84%
so those field will only
contain the low energy

01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:35.600 align:middle line:84%
part that already isolated
the big things in here.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.330 align:middle line:84%
So the time dependence here will
only include the low energy.

01:03:38.330 --> 01:03:41.130 align:middle line:90%


01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:46.570 align:middle line:84%
So we assume that as a t
phi would be mv squared,

01:03:46.570 --> 01:04:04.560 align:middle line:84%
so phi similarly this X.
Similarly this X. So this is

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:07.110 align:middle line:84%
the fast oscillator
part in time,

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:09.720 align:middle line:90%
this is the slow part in time.

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:15.770 align:middle line:84%
So now we plug this in
to these two equations.

01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:19.860 align:middle line:90%
Plugged into those equations.

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:24.750 align:middle line:90%
Then we find i partial t.

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:29.080 align:middle line:90%


01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:34.510 align:middle line:84%
i partial t phi
equal to sigma dot

01:04:34.510 --> 01:04:49.390 align:middle line:84%
pi x plus eA0 phi and i
partial tx equal to 2 minus mx.

01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:53.040 align:middle line:90%


01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Let me just call it
x for simplicity.

01:04:55.980 --> 01:05:05.280 align:middle line:90%


01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.890 align:middle line:84%
So I also have
introduced the notation

01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:13.680 align:middle line:84%
that the pi is
equal to p plus eA.

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:24.040 align:middle line:90%


01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:26.650 align:middle line:84%
So now you see the difference
between these two equations.

01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:29.540 align:middle line:90%


01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:35.260 align:middle line:84%
So the mass terms here
have opposite sign.

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:39.990 align:middle line:84%
When I isolate that
piece, and then

01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:43.770 align:middle line:84%
the mass term for this equation
canceled, but in this equation

01:05:43.770 --> 01:05:45.930 align:middle line:84%
they add together,
this minus 2m.

01:05:45.930 --> 01:05:48.660 align:middle line:90%


01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:51.850 align:middle line:90%
We get this minus 2m.

01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:53.320 align:middle line:84%
So now let's look
at the magnitude

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.070 align:middle line:90%
of each term in this equation.

01:05:55.070 --> 01:06:04.350 align:middle line:84%
So this is like mv squared
X. So this is like m times X.

01:06:04.350 --> 01:06:08.700 align:middle line:90%
So this is just something phi.

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:10.230 align:middle line:84%
We don't know the
relative magnitude

01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:12.520 align:middle line:84%
between X and the phi,
and so this is also

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:17.760 align:middle line:84%
mv squared X. We said eA0
should be of order mv squared.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:20.400 align:middle line:90%


01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:25.020 align:middle line:84%
So these three terms,
they're all related to X,

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:29.780 align:middle line:84%
and this term dominates
over these two.

01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:32.540 align:middle line:84%
So you can forget
about these two terms

01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:33.800 align:middle line:90%
in the nonrelativistic limit.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:39.840 align:middle line:90%


01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:46.560 align:middle line:84%
So from here, if I call this
equation 1 and this equation 2,

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:53.550 align:middle line:84%
and from 2 we get in the
nonrelativistic limit,

01:06:53.550 --> 01:07:02.190 align:middle line:84%
we just get 2mX plus sigma
pi acting on phi equal to 0.

01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:09.530 align:middle line:90%


01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So now we find that X, we can
now solve X in terms of phi--

01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:21.890 align:middle line:90%
1 over 2m sigma dot pi phi.

01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:32.970 align:middle line:90%


01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:37.540 align:middle line:84%
So now we can plug this
back into this equation.

01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:40.800 align:middle line:90%
So this is equation 3.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:47.430 align:middle line:84%
If we plug 3 into
1 again, then we

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:52.410 align:middle line:84%
get Schrodinger
equation for phi.

01:07:52.410 --> 01:07:54.660 align:middle line:84%
So X is no longer
independent field,

01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:58.040 align:middle line:84%
it's just expressed
in terms of phi.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.665 align:middle line:84%
So now we get the
equation for phi.

01:07:59.665 --> 01:08:17.470 align:middle line:90%


01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:19.270 align:middle line:84%
So now you see
each term, they are

01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:20.990 align:middle line:90%
of the same order of magnitude.

01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:26.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is mv squared
and this is mv.

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:28.170 align:middle line:90%
Upstairs pi of order mv.

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:30.689 align:middle line:84%
So this is m squared v
squared divided by m,

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:34.479 align:middle line:84%
so this again is mv squared
and eA0 is mv squared.

01:08:34.479 --> 01:08:37.229 align:middle line:84%
So now everything
is nonrelativistic

01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:39.803 align:middle line:90%
and of the same order.

01:08:39.803 --> 01:08:41.720 align:middle line:84%
So now let's look at the
meaning of this term.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:48.058 align:middle line:90%


01:08:48.058 --> 01:08:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Now let's look at the
meaning of that term.

01:08:49.850 --> 01:09:08.670 align:middle line:90%


01:09:08.670 --> 01:09:10.718 align:middle line:84%
So that term you can
write explicitly.

01:09:10.718 --> 01:09:19.290 align:middle line:90%


01:09:19.290 --> 01:09:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Sigma i pi i, sigma j pi j,
but remember pi i and pi j,

01:09:23.370 --> 01:09:28.710 align:middle line:84%
they are operators, so you need
to keep the ordering there.

01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:32.069 align:middle line:90%


01:09:32.069 --> 01:09:34.380 align:middle line:84%
So we can just write
down, so we just

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:43.660 align:middle line:84%
have sigma i sigma j just gives
me delta ij plus i epsilon ijk

01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:46.899 align:middle line:90%
sigma k and then pi i pi j.

01:09:46.899 --> 01:09:51.410 align:middle line:90%


01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And so the first term
gives me the pi squared,

01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:04.840 align:middle line:84%
and the second term I can just,
using the antisymmetric in ij,

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:11.720 align:middle line:84%
I can write it as epsilon ijk
sigma k and the pi i and the pi

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:12.220 align:middle line:90%
j.

01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:15.150 align:middle line:90%


01:10:15.150 --> 01:10:17.430 align:middle line:84%
So I just write the
commutator in terms of them.

01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:20.840 align:middle line:90%


01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:28.750 align:middle line:84%
So now it's easy to
calculate pi i pi j.

01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:41.235 align:middle line:84%
So this is just minus partial
i plus eAi minus partial j --

01:10:41.235 --> 01:10:42.810 align:middle line:90%
minus i partial j --

01:10:42.810 --> 01:10:45.952 align:middle line:90%
plus eAj.

01:10:45.952 --> 01:10:47.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you calculate
the commutator,

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:49.000 align:middle line:90%
you just get minus e Fij.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:56.470 align:middle line:90%


01:10:56.470 --> 01:11:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And now if you plug this Fij
into here, so epsilon ijk

01:11:01.330 --> 01:11:02.980 align:middle line:90%
times Fij, what do you get?

01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:08.050 align:middle line:90%


01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember when
epsilon ijk multiplied

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:11.920 align:middle line:90%
by Fij, what do you get?

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:15.020 align:middle line:90%


01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:17.000 align:middle line:90%
You get B.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So now this equation, when
you plug this in here,

01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:26.770 align:middle line:84%
and then this just
becomes pi squared plus--

01:11:26.770 --> 01:11:27.670 align:middle line:90%
just make sure.

01:11:27.670 --> 01:11:34.490 align:middle line:90%


01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:49.310 align:middle line:84%
e sigma dot B. Because
Fij multiplied by the Fijk

01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:53.944 align:middle line:84%
just gets Bk and Bk sigma
k, just sigma dot B.

01:11:53.944 --> 01:11:57.353 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:57.353 --> 01:11:58.630 align:middle line:90%


01:11:58.630 --> 01:12:02.420 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, it's one half
epsilon ijk times Fij give you.

01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:06.520 align:middle line:90%


01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:11.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you use one
half epsilon ijk Fij.

01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:18.600 align:middle line:90%


01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.890 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

01:12:19.890 --> 01:12:22.770 align:middle line:90%
We are there.

01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:26.340 align:middle line:90%
So now we are done, essentially.

01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:29.160 align:middle line:84%
So now the Schrodinger
equation, now we

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:33.360 align:middle line:84%
get the partial t
phi equal to H phi.

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:37.730 align:middle line:90%
Now H is equal to p squared.

01:12:37.730 --> 01:12:40.940 align:middle line:90%
So now you have pi squared.

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:43.370 align:middle line:84%
So pi squared, if I
write it explicitly,

01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:49.400 align:middle line:84%
is p plus eA squared
divided by 2m, then

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:56.360 align:middle line:84%
plus e divided by 2m sigma
dot B, come from this term.

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:59.520 align:middle line:90%


01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:02.310 align:middle line:90%
And then the last term is eA0.

01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:06.110 align:middle line:90%


01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So now if you recognize
this part of the Hamiltonian

01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:17.050 align:middle line:84%
is precisely what you get when
you couple Schrodinger equation

01:13:17.050 --> 01:13:20.170 align:middle line:90%
to your electromagnetic fields.

01:13:20.170 --> 01:13:24.020 align:middle line:84%
You just add the p plus eA
for the vector potential

01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:26.740 align:middle line:90%
and here you get eA0.

01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:28.820 align:middle line:84%
But now here you get
the additional term,

01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:31.980 align:middle line:84%
so this is called
the Pauli term.

01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:34.990 align:middle line:84%
When the particle has
spin, has magnetic moment,

01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:36.460 align:middle line:84%
then you have an
additional term.

01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:38.350 align:middle line:90%
So this term can be interpreted.

01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:42.865 align:middle line:84%
So remember, when a particle
has a magnetic moment.

01:13:42.865 --> 01:13:54.640 align:middle line:90%


01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:59.790 align:middle line:84%
So when a particle
has a magnetic moment,

01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:05.640 align:middle line:84%
then you have a piece
corresponding to mu dot B.

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:07.980 align:middle line:84%
If you compare this
with that term,

01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:09.930 align:middle line:90%
then we conclude that the mu--

01:14:09.930 --> 01:14:12.360 align:middle line:84%
So in this case,
compare that term.

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:22.380 align:middle line:84%
That term will be equal
to e 2m sigma dot B.

01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:27.390 align:middle line:84%
So now we conclude, from here
you can read what's the mu.

01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:35.050 align:middle line:84%
mu just minus e divided
by 2m times 2 times sigma

01:14:35.050 --> 01:14:36.730 align:middle line:90%
divided by 2.

01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:41.770 align:middle line:84%
So if you compare with
this, you find that the g

01:14:41.770 --> 01:14:44.916 align:middle line:90%
is exactly equal to 2.

01:14:44.916 --> 01:14:49.010 align:middle line:90%
You find g exactly equal to 2.

01:14:49.010 --> 01:14:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And so this way, you see
actually the Dirac equation

01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:57.140 align:middle line:84%
contains the information the
electron has magnetic moment.

01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:58.940 align:middle line:90%
It has a magnetic moment.

01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:00.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:00.468 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
would we expect

01:15:00.468 --> 01:15:01.926 align:middle line:84%
g equal to 2 for
all fermions then?

01:15:01.926 --> 01:15:07.860 align:middle line:90%


01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:10.200 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:13.080 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Even if we look at
these perturbative calculations

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:15.247 align:middle line:84%
like the 1 plus 0.001, etc.,
that should apply also?

01:15:15.247 --> 01:15:19.650 align:middle line:90%


01:15:19.650 --> 01:15:21.535 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: No, no, no.

01:15:21.535 --> 01:15:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Because the correction
can be different

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:26.060 align:middle line:84%
for different formulas
because different formulas,

01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:28.080 align:middle line:84%
they have different
interactions.

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And so that will change
this vertex differently.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:34.310 align:middle line:84%
For example, muons and
electrons will be different.

01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:38.030 align:middle line:90%


01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:38.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:39.606 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:39.606 --> 01:15:49.700 align:middle line:90%


01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:52.640 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Well, in the high
speed you can no longer--

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:58.290 align:middle line:84%
So when you have high speeds or
this effect, they mix together.

01:15:58.290 --> 01:16:01.180 align:middle line:84%
So relativistically,
you can no longer

01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:03.610 align:middle line:84%
isolate the contribution
from the angular momentum

01:16:03.610 --> 01:16:05.153 align:middle line:84%
from your orbital
angular momentum,

01:16:05.153 --> 01:16:06.070 align:middle line:90%
spin angular momentum.

01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:07.320 align:middle line:90%
They all come together.

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's only in the
long relativistic case

01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:11.410 align:middle line:90%
you can isolate like this.

01:16:11.410 --> 01:16:13.605 align:middle line:84%
So normally when we talk
about magnetic moments,

01:16:13.605 --> 01:16:14.980 align:middle line:84%
we always think
it about in terms

01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:16.510 align:middle line:90%
of nonrelativistic situation.

01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:20.350 align:middle line:90%


01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:24.610 align:middle line:90%
So now just some final words.

01:16:24.610 --> 01:16:27.320 align:middle line:90%
Just erased that number.

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:31.250 align:middle line:84%
So Schwinger then
did this calculation.

01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:38.410 align:middle line:84%
So including this diagram,
Schwinger did this calculation,

01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:42.850 align:middle line:84%
and then he found that
there's a small correction.

01:16:42.850 --> 01:16:45.370 align:middle line:84%
So normally, its called
-- say if I call it --

01:16:45.370 --> 01:16:51.890 align:middle line:84%
1 plus F. And so this
is the correction.

01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And then the correction, which
Schwinger first calculated,

01:16:56.570 --> 01:17:00.800 align:middle line:84%
is given by alpha
just divided by 2pi.

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.740 align:middle line:84%
The reason it's alpha is
because here there's a e here,

01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:07.700 align:middle line:84%
here there's an e, so
e squared is alpha.

01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So all this
complicated calculation

01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:13.703 align:middle line:84%
you do, essentially you
find this 1 over 2pi.

01:17:13.703 --> 01:17:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Because this correction
has to be proportional

01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:20.450 align:middle line:84%
to alpha, and this number you
do a very hard calculation,

01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:22.850 align:middle line:90%
you find it's 1 over 2pi.

01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And then this actually agreed
with experiment very well.

01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:31.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is first calculated
by Schwinger in 1948.

01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:36.200 align:middle line:84%
So this was really a
theoretical triumph at that time

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:40.910 align:middle line:84%
and agreed very well
with experiments.

01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:45.710 align:middle line:84%
So then people then
calculate to higher orders.

01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So the next order must be
proportional to alpha squared,

01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:54.932 align:middle line:84%
so we can parameterize by
alpha divided by 2pi squared,

01:17:54.932 --> 01:17:56.140 align:middle line:90%
and then with some number a2.

01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:59.340 align:middle line:90%


01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:01.840 align:middle line:84%
You do an even more complicated
calculation, much, much more

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:04.420 align:middle line:84%
complicated calculation, you
find that this a2, again, it's

01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:05.910 align:middle line:90%
a single number.

01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And this contains
seven diagrams.

01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:12.210 align:middle line:84%
So this is one diagram, but
when you go to the next order,

01:18:12.210 --> 01:18:14.810 align:middle line:84%
actually involving
seven diagrams.

01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:18.290 align:middle line:90%
And that was calculated in 1957.

01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Again, it was a very important
thing to do at that time,

01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:26.420 align:middle line:84%
because just to
check whether QED,

01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:30.530 align:middle line:84%
because the experimental
accuracy was at the level

01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:32.315 align:middle line:84%
actually you can
compare this number.

01:18:32.315 --> 01:18:37.160 align:middle line:90%


01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Actually, also there's
some kind of story

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.830 align:middle line:84%
behind this number,
which at the beginning

01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:45.500 align:middle line:84%
they calculated
wrong, et cetera.

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:48.224 align:middle line:84%
So now you can also
calculate the next one, a3.

01:18:48.224 --> 01:18:50.990 align:middle line:90%


01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:53.720 align:middle line:84%
You can parameterize
again by cube.

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:57.395 align:middle line:84%
And now this now
includes 72 diagrams.

01:18:57.395 --> 01:19:00.780 align:middle line:90%


01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:03.700 align:middle line:90%
And it took two physicists--

01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:05.730 align:middle line:90%
I won't write down their names--

01:19:05.730 --> 01:19:09.370 align:middle line:84%
it took them 25 years
to calculate it.

01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:10.530 align:middle line:90%
So actually they used it.

01:19:10.530 --> 01:19:14.320 align:middle line:90%


01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:18.600 align:middle line:84%
So in 1996 they finally
calculated this.

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:26.090 align:middle line:84%
But now if you want to say,
oh, let's try to calculate a4,

01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:29.290 align:middle line:84%
this includes 891
diagrams just in QED.

01:19:29.290 --> 01:19:32.350 align:middle line:90%


01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And actually, this is also
calculated using computer.

01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:39.170 align:middle line:90%


01:19:39.170 --> 01:19:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And also, you can
calculate this for muon.

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:45.540 align:middle line:90%


01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:47.220 align:middle line:84%
At a certain level,
you also need

01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:49.810 align:middle line:84%
to include the contribution
from other interactions,

01:19:49.810 --> 01:19:53.800 align:middle line:84%
not just QED, weak
interactions, et cetera.

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so the reason you want
to calculate such a number

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:03.420 align:middle line:84%
to very high accuracy
is because this F

01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:08.585 align:middle line:84%
can be measured to very, very
high accuracy experimentally.

01:20:08.585 --> 01:20:09.960 align:middle line:84%
So actually,
experimentally, this

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:15.010 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most accurately
measured number in physics.

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:18.755 align:middle line:84%
They can measure this F
to order of 10 to the -12.

01:20:18.755 --> 01:20:29.790 align:middle line:90%


01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:32.550 align:middle line:84%
I think at the
theoretical level,

01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:34.950 align:middle line:84%
you actually cannot calculate
to this level accuracy,

01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:42.790 align:middle line:84%
but still you can compare to
very, very good agreement.

01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:48.975 align:middle line:84%
So QED actually describes
nature very, very well.

01:20:48.975 --> 01:20:52.020 align:middle line:90%


01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:55.785 align:middle line:90%
So I think that's all.

01:20:55.785 --> 01:21:01.170 align:middle line:90%


01:21:01.170 --> 01:21:04.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm honored and very happy
to have this opportunity

01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:09.270 align:middle line:84%
to take you to this first part
of the journey to quantum field

01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:14.580 align:middle line:84%
theory, and I want
to thank you all

01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:20.430 align:middle line:84%
for making this
journey very enjoyable

01:21:20.430 --> 01:21:24.900 align:middle line:84%
and rewarding for myself, and I
hope you have learned something

01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:31.770 align:middle line:84%
from this class, and whatever
your career path takes you,

01:21:31.770 --> 01:21:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I hope you will later
find this course useful.

01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:37.270 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:40.320 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]
