00:00:06.958 --> 00:00:10.440 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.120 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: OK.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.380 align:middle line:90%
So let us start.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.390 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.900 align:middle line:84%
So first, I'll remind you
the master formula we derived

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.385 align:middle line:90%
before for path integral.

00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:27.270 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.830 align:middle line:84%
We said, if we consider
time-ordered anything, OK,

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.570 align:middle line:84%
so let me just call it x
will be, say, some product

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.270 align:middle line:90%
of operators.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And then this can be written
as, in the path integral form,

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.320 align:middle line:90%
D phi.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And then so x, it
just goes into here.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.190 align:middle line:90%
And then you have is, OK?

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And then divided by D phi
just without x just is, OK?

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.360 align:middle line:84%
So this is the master
formula we derived before,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.060 align:middle line:84%
which applies to any theory,
OK, in principle, any theory

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.790 align:middle line:90%
and any x you want, OK?

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And so things inside
this x should always

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.130 align:middle line:90%
be time ordered, OK?

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.510 align:middle line:90%
So this T means time order.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.650 align:middle line:84%
So now we can apply this
to interacting theory.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.580 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So for interacting
theory, we have

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.060 align:middle line:84%
S. We write S. So the action
to be the free theory action

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.120 align:middle line:90%
plus the interaction part, OK?

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And the interaction
part, in turn,

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.690 align:middle line:84%
can be written as
say the integration

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.250 align:middle line:84%
over the interaction part
of the Lagrangian density.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the
same as the minus

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.220 align:middle line:84%
the interacting part
of the Hamiltonian

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.710 align:middle line:90%
integrated over time, OK?

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.070 align:middle line:84%
So the reason for
this simple relation

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:84%
is because we assume the
interacting part does not

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.630 align:middle line:90%
contain time derivatives.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.500 align:middle line:84%
So essentially,
interacting particles

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.190 align:middle line:84%
binding to a potential in
your Lagrangian density.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
Hamiltonian, they just

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.620 align:middle line:90%
differ by a minus sign.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.460 align:middle line:90%


00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.020 align:middle line:84%
So now we can just apply
this to this case, OK?

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.710 align:middle line:90%
So let's see.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.140 align:middle line:84%
So we can just
write this object.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.400 align:middle line:90%
So now we can write it as--

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.580 align:middle line:90%
also come here.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.420 align:middle line:84%
So our goal is that we assume
the Si is small compared to S0

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.240 align:middle line:84%
because we cannot solve
this theory exactly.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And so what we
are going to do is

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.670 align:middle line:84%
we want to treat Si to be small
and expand in the cautioning

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.280 align:middle line:90%
Si.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.880 align:middle line:84%
OK, so example, of Si
is this lambda phi 4,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.010 align:middle line:90%
which we wrote down before.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.610 align:middle line:84%
So for this purpose, then we can
just write this more explicitly

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:90%
as D phi.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.540 align:middle line:90%
Then you have x.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.350 align:middle line:90%
Then you have i S0.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.530 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.140 align:middle line:90%
Then exponential i Si.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.820 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:30.145 align:middle line:84%
Then divide it by phi
exponential i S0, i Si.

00:03:30.145 --> 00:03:30.645 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:30.645 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And now so we can now
treat this as the integrand

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.330 align:middle line:84%
for the-- yeah, so
this is the integration

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.920 align:middle line:90%
for the free theory.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.430 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.320 align:middle line:84%
So now we can
integrate this just

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.030 align:middle line:84%
as a integrand for the free
theory, as some, say, x prime.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.740 align:middle line:84%
So x times the exponential
i Si as another

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.010 align:middle line:84%
x for the free theory
and similarly here, OK?

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:90%
So we can write this as follows.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So we can write this
as now in free theory.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.800 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.790 align:middle line:84%
So upstairs should
corresponding to the 0.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.890 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let me just not worry
about it at the moment.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:35.450 align:middle line:84%
So now you can write it as the
time-ordered x exponential i Si

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.130 align:middle line:90%
0.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.540 align:middle line:90%
Now this is in free theory.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.610 align:middle line:90%
So I put a subscript 0 here.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.585 align:middle line:90%
Means in free theory.

00:04:41.585 --> 00:04:53.735 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.735 --> 00:04:54.235 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:54.235 --> 00:05:01.710 align:middle line:90%


00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.430 align:middle line:84%
So in writing from here
to here, so upstairs,

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.870 align:middle line:84%
we interpreted as a correlation
function in the free theory.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.710 align:middle line:84%
So here, we should
also divide by--

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.580 align:middle line:84%
yeah, in order to write in
terms of the expectation

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.580 align:middle line:84%
value in the free-- yeah, so 0
here is the free theory vacuum.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:30.620 align:middle line:90%


00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.980 align:middle line:84%
So in writing the
upstairs in this form,

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.860 align:middle line:84%
we should divide this
by a path integral just

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.660 align:middle line:90%
with the exponential as 0.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.577 align:middle line:84%
But since upstairs
and downstairs

00:05:40.577 --> 00:05:42.410 align:middle line:84%
we need to divide by
the same path integral,

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.670 align:middle line:90%
they just cancel, OK?

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.770 align:middle line:84%
So I can just
directly write down

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.420 align:middle line:84%
as the ratio of these two
correlation functions.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.490 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And so now this is a
very nice form, OK?

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Because so this is-- yeah, let
me call this equation star.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is the star is
the exact expression.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:13.820 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:14.320 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.070 align:middle line:90%


00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Which writes
correlation function

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:48.520 align:middle line:84%
of an interacting theory in
terms of those of free theory.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:56.450 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.070 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.310 align:middle line:84%
So now these are just
some correlation functions

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:90%
in the free theory.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.440 align:middle line:84%
So both upstairs and downstairs,
they can, in principle,

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.680 align:middle line:84%
evaluated as we discussed
before in free theory.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.272 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:07:10.272 --> 00:07:11.730 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So I'm
a little confused.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:15.763 align:middle line:84%
What is there to time-order for
the phase for the e to the i --

00:07:15.763 --> 00:07:17.523 align:middle line:90%
with the interaction?

00:07:17.523 --> 00:07:18.190 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Right.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:18.450 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:19.980 align:middle line:84%
As we discussed
before, whenever you

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.050 align:middle line:84%
see time-ordered
exponential, you

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.130 align:middle line:84%
should always expand the
exponential in power series.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And then you just have
a bunch of factors.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.271 align:middle line:90%
And you just time order them.

00:07:32.271 --> 00:07:34.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.880 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.020 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.950 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is precisely
the expression,

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.560 align:middle line:90%
which derived in Peskin.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.490 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this is the--

00:07:51.490 --> 00:08:10.980 align:middle line:84%
so this equation is the 4.31
of Peskin and Schroeder,

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:16.350 align:middle line:84%
which they derived using
the interaction picture, OK?

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.930 align:middle line:84%
So we see that for
the path integral,

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.930 align:middle line:84%
to derive this equation using
path integral is just trivial.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, you just split the
exponential for the full theory

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.360 align:middle line:84%
into that of the free theory
and the interacting part.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And then you automatically
derive this equation.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:32.940 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:38.850 align:middle line:84%
So once you have understood how
path integral works and then

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.919 align:middle line:84%
derive this equation
becomes trivial.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:46.200 align:middle line:90%
And so this is actually general.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Later, the same
expression, we will

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:middle line:84%
be able to apply
it for, say, when

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.910 align:middle line:84%
we include fermions and
also photons, et cetera, OK?

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:56.640 align:middle line:90%


00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And now we will evaluate this
guy using perturbation theory,

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:03.960 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:23.190 align:middle line:84%
So we will expand star
in power series of Si.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:28.140 align:middle line:90%
OK, we treat Si as small.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, just expand
it in power series.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:44.990 align:middle line:84%
So more explicitly, say,
we consider the Gn, so

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.430 align:middle line:90%
this Gn for the full theory.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So let me call this Gn, just say
this is some n-point function.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.650 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this is the Gn.

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we can
just, more explicity,

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.960 align:middle line:84%
we can just write
Gn as the 0th order.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:08.780 align:middle line:84%
You just have T X
0, OK, upstairs.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And the next order would
be i dt say 0 T X H I.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.570 align:middle line:84%
So I have expanded
to the first order.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.950 align:middle line:84%
In Si, when I expand
Si, then become

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.900 align:middle line:90%
dt times Hi with a minus sign.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.620 align:middle line:84%
So I just write it in
terms like that, OK?

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And so remember here, you need
to time order them together.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Because both of them are
in the same integrand, OK?

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So we need to time order
them together, and et cetera.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.610 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this is upstairs.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And downstairs, you
just expand this guy.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:59.200 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, you
have 1 minus i dt.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Then you can time-order the
Hamiltonian, the interacting

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.400 align:middle line:90%
part of the Hamiltonian.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.590 align:middle line:90%
And then plus higher order.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:12.270 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:16.800 align:middle line:84%
So you just now essentially do
the Taylor series expansion.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.560 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And the first-- so
you always assume

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.440 align:middle line:90%
the interacting part is small.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually expand
the downstairs also.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.270 align:middle line:84%
So this will be reduced
to, say, the first order.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:37.030 align:middle line:84%
So the 0th order just gives
you the free theory n-point

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.080 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.470 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I denote now
with a subscript 0

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.380 align:middle line:84%
means the free theory
correlation function.

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:44.980 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And then yeah, and then you
can add the rest, et cetera.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:57.470 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the higher
order perturbations.

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:59.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.800 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.030 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Actually, for later purpose,
let me just write one more term

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.130 align:middle line:90%
just explicitly.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.680 align:middle line:90%
Let me just write it.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:16.520 align:middle line:84%
So if I bring this up, so
when I bring this up and then

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:39.630 align:middle line:84%
this becomes i 0 T X 0,
then times dt 0 T H I.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Also, so this is this
term we bring up.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:44.880 align:middle line:90%
And then multiply that term.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.030 align:middle line:90%
That will give you that.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And then there's another
first order term is given by i

00:12:50.970 --> 00:13:02.100 align:middle line:90%
dt 0 T X H I 0.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And then so these are the
full first-order terms.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, so these are the full
first-order order terms,

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:13.770 align:middle line:84%
which is the correction to the
free theory n-point functions.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And we need to evaluate
those quantities.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And all those correlation
functions in the free theory

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.550 align:middle line:84%
can be just evaluated
using the Wick theorem

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.140 align:middle line:90%
because we know how to--

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.750 align:middle line:84%
because all correlation
functions in free theory

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.480 align:middle line:84%
just can be evaluated
using Wick theorem.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Just use the Wick
theorem over and over.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:31.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.130 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:35.405 align:middle line:90%
So any questions on this?

00:13:35.405 --> 00:13:40.410 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:43.390 align:middle line:84%
So now we will develop
techniques to evaluate

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.480 align:middle line:90%
such kind of series, OK?

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Still, even though this is
not too difficult to do now,

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.960 align:middle line:84%
but still when you do it in
practice, it's pretty tedious.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So still worth making effort to
actually simplify the process,

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.210 align:middle line:90%
OK, simplify the process.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:05.815 align:middle line:84%
And the technique to simplify
is called the Feynman diagrams.

00:14:05.815 --> 00:14:13.270 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:20.150 align:middle line:84%
So now we will consider,
so far, those equations

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:23.590 align:middle line:84%
apply for any theory, any
kind of interaction, OK?

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:26.690 align:middle line:84%
So now let's work on
for a specific case.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:31.360 align:middle line:84%
So let's consider Li
equal to minus lambda

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.120 align:middle line:84%
divided by 4 factorial
phi to the power of 4, OK?

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:42.520 align:middle line:84%
So it means that H I
would be integrated over--

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:49.260 align:middle line:84%
so H I, yeah, so
yeah anyway, yeah,

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:53.280 align:middle line:84%
the others you can just
directly right from here, OK?

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.630 align:middle line:90%
So let's consider this case.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:57.380 align:middle line:90%


00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And so to be specific--
and now also,

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.970 align:middle line:84%
let's consider-- just in
the simplest correlation

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:10.360 align:middle line:84%
function-- let's just consider
the two-point function.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's just consider the
two-point function, G2.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.090 align:middle line:84%
So two-point is also
the Feynman function.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.710 align:middle line:84%
But now this is the
Feynman function

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:19.930 align:middle line:90%
in the interacting theory.

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:23.240 align:middle line:90%


00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.790 align:middle line:90%
So now we have two--

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.860 align:middle line:84%
so imagine we have
two coordinates--

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.840 align:middle line:90%
and then is equal to -- now.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.040 align:middle line:90%
So let's consider this.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:39.670 align:middle line:90%


00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:43.930 align:middle line:84%
So now let's consider
the Feynman function

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:47.430 align:middle line:90%
in the full theory.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And now we can just now
apply this equation.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:55.390 align:middle line:84%
So let us try to calculate
to the next order.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:16:02.360 align:middle line:84%
So the 0-th order that's given
by the free theory, two-point

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.430 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.600 align:middle line:84%
So by translation
symmetry, it's always

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.760 align:middle line:90%
a function of x1 minus x2.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So this does not
depend on whether it's

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:16.300 align:middle line:84%
in the free theory or
interacting theory.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.900 align:middle line:90%
And now let's just plug in here.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.720 align:middle line:90%
Let's just plug in here.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:29.340 align:middle line:84%
So H I is integration
of this over

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.940 align:middle line:90%
a three-dimensional spatial.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And then combined, this become
just four-dimensional spacetime

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:37.080 align:middle line:90%
integrals.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.360 align:middle line:90%
So then you just get the--

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:49.480 align:middle line:84%
so this term becomes plus i
lambda divided by 4 factorial.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.890 align:middle line:84%
So we will assume this
lambda is small so

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:55.155 align:middle line:90%
that we can expand this lambda.

00:16:55.155 --> 00:16:58.670 align:middle line:90%


00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And this term, just again, is
the free theory correlation

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.390 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:05.910 align:middle line:90%
So we just have GF--

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:11.410 align:middle line:90%
again, 0-- x1 minus x2.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And then times-- my
board is a little bit--

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:21.540 align:middle line:90%
so we have to go through here--

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:28.520 align:middle line:84%
times-- then you have
d4 x then 0, T, and phi

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.830 align:middle line:90%
to the power 4 x here.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:35.770 align:middle line:90%
So this is multiplied with that.

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.720 align:middle line:90%
So that's the second term.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:46.097 align:middle line:84%
And the third term is minus
i lambda to the 4 factorial.

00:17:46.097 --> 00:17:46.680 align:middle line:90%
You have d4 x.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.200 align:middle line:90%


00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:55.740 align:middle line:84%
You have 0, T. Then you have
to combine them together.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:04.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is phi x1, phi x2,
and phi to the power 4 x--

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.710 align:middle line:90%
and this x is integrated over--

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:08.700 align:middle line:90%
And then 0.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.450 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:14.840 align:middle line:90%
And so this is all time ordered.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest is all
times lambda squared,

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:20.913 align:middle line:90%
plus lambda squared.

00:18:20.913 --> 00:18:28.440 align:middle line:90%


00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:28.940 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:29.857 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:18:29.857 --> 00:18:32.270 align:middle line:90%


00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:35.330 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, so let me just
make a quick remark.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:40.250 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:49.830 align:middle line:84%
So in the end, so
just note can be--

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:53.880 align:middle line:90%
so yeah.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So here, even though
we only write down

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.210 align:middle line:84%
the first-order term,
but you can continue.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:23.110 align:middle line:84%
So all terms in the
expansion can be evaluated by

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:34.040 align:middle line:90%
repeated apply the Wick theorem.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:37.190 align:middle line:84%
So any such kind of
functions, they all

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:41.570 align:middle line:84%
factorize into
two-point functions.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And the two-point
functions are essentially

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:84%
just given by GF 0, just the
GF 0, free theory two-point

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.540 align:middle line:90%
functions.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:58.565 align:middle line:84%
So the final result
always have the form--

00:19:58.565 --> 00:20:04.720 align:middle line:90%


00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:16.065 align:middle line:84%
final result always have the
form sum over products of GF

00:20:16.065 --> 00:20:16.565 align:middle line:90%
0's--

00:20:16.565 --> 00:20:20.530 align:middle line:90%


00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.350 align:middle line:84%
and plus some integration,
so sum of the--

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:30.600 align:middle line:90%


00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:90%
plus possible integrations.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:36.480 align:middle line:84%
So, in general, the
structure is pretty simple.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:40.190 align:middle line:84%
They all just reduce
to the product

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:42.005 align:middle line:90%
of those two-point functions.

00:20:42.005 --> 00:20:44.980 align:middle line:90%


00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So now, as an example, let's
just evaluate these two pieces,

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:53.050 align:middle line:90%
evaluate these two pieces.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:55.090 align:middle line:90%
So let's continue.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:21:00.475 align:middle line:84%
So we find that the
GF x1 minus x2--

00:21:00.475 --> 00:21:02.920 align:middle line:90%
yeah, so GF is the same as G2.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.730 align:middle line:84%
So for two-point function, this
is just the Feynman function

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:07.855 align:middle line:90%
for the interacting theory.

00:21:07.855 --> 00:21:10.360 align:middle line:90%


00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.870 align:middle line:84%
So the leading
term is just GF 0.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.940 align:middle line:90%


00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And then now let's
evaluate this term.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.030 align:middle line:90%
Now evaluate this.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:26.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is all phi
contracted on the same point.

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:28.670 align:middle line:90%
So there are four phi's.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:32.280 align:middle line:84%
We could just contract
them within themselves.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:36.130 align:middle line:90%
So we essentially get to the--

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:38.800 align:middle line:90%
so you have GF.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And then the next term
is i, 4 factorial--

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:50.950 align:middle line:90%
i lambda 4 factorial.

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:54.370 align:middle line:90%
And then you have GF 0.

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:59.680 align:middle line:84%
So x1,2-- so let me use x1,2 to
denote x1 minus x2 just to save

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.890 align:middle line:90%
a little bit effort.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And then we have this
integration over d4 x.

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.050 align:middle line:90%
And then let's evaluate this.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:13.720 align:middle line:84%
So this just reduce to
two Feynman propagators.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.760 align:middle line:90%
But both of them have 0.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:23.230 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, you just
have GF 0, 0 is x minus x.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:26.830 align:middle line:90%


00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:30.300 align:middle line:90%
So we just get that, x minus x.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.410 align:middle line:84%
So let me just
write one of them.

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:38.520 align:middle line:90%


00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:42.570 align:middle line:84%
But we are actually missing some
factors because we have four

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.690 align:middle line:90%
phi's.

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:48.220 align:middle line:84%
So when you contract
the four phi's, there's

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.720 align:middle line:84%
three different
ways to group them.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:55.150 align:middle line:90%
so We should have a factor of 3.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:56.710 align:middle line:84%
There's three
different ways to group

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:58.520 align:middle line:90%
four phi's into two groups.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.230 align:middle line:90%
Then we have a factor of 3.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:08.080 align:middle line:90%


00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:12.038 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now let's
look at this term.

00:23:12.038 --> 00:23:13.205 align:middle line:90%
Now let's look at this term.

00:23:13.205 --> 00:23:16.960 align:middle line:90%


00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.990 align:middle line:84%
So this term, now
have now we have

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:23.820 align:middle line:84%
to contract six phi's,
so phi x1, phi x2,

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.590 align:middle line:84%
and then there are
four phi's here.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:28.580 align:middle line:84%
So we need to
contract six phi's.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:32.130 align:middle line:84%
So we can have two
possible patterns.

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Inside this, two phi's
contract with themselves.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:40.120 align:middle line:84%
These two phi's-- this phi
x1, phi x2 contract with

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:40.840 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And then four phi's will have
to contract among themselves.

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Or phi x1, if phi x1 contract
with one of the phi here,

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:53.090 align:middle line:84%
then phi x2 also have to
contract with one of the phi

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:53.660 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So you have two possible
patterns for contraction.

00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So the first one is important,
is just first contract phi x1

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.550 align:middle line:90%
and phi x2.

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So again, so we have minus i
lambda divided by 4 factorial.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:24.370 align:middle line:84%
So when we contract x1, x2,
then we just get GF 0 x1,2.

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And then we contract
phi 4 themselves.

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.360 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we did before.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.680 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing as above.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So we just get a factor
of 3 d4 x and then GF 0.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.930 align:middle line:90%
We evaluate at 0 squared--

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.810 align:middle line:90%
just the same as this.

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:49.080 align:middle line:84%
But then the other term,
phi contract with this--

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:54.260 align:middle line:84%
so each of these, x1,
x2 contract with here.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.950 align:middle line:90%
So in this case--

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:58.910 align:middle line:84%
so let's imagine this
contract with them.

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Then there are
four possibilities.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.630 align:middle line:84%
So after this contract
with one of them,

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:06.870 align:middle line:84%
this contract with that, then
I have three possibilities.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:84%
So you have 4 times three
combinatorial factors.

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:15.720 align:middle line:84%
So you have i
lambda 4 factorial.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:19.070 align:middle line:90%
Then you have 4 times 3.

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Then you have d4 x.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.020 align:middle line:90%


00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Then here, we have
GF 0 x minus x1--

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.180 align:middle line:90%
so x1 minus x.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:37.000 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter--
and GF 0 x2 minus x.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And then the last
one just contract

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.500 align:middle line:90%
with self, just again, GF 0, 0--

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.760 align:middle line:90%


00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.880 align:middle line:84%
times-- and order
lambda squared.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.750 align:middle line:90%


00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.340 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
explicit expressions.

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.010 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
explicit expressions.

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:59.600 align:middle line:90%


00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.610 align:middle line:84%
So now you can actually-- notice
that these two terms actually

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:04.480 align:middle line:90%
are the same, right?

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.610 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:10.490 align:middle line:84%
So these two terms
actually are identical.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And they just differ by a
sign, so actually, they cancel.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.620 align:middle line:90%
So these cancel.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So we just left with
that and then this term.

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.974 align:middle line:90%
We just with this term.

00:26:21.974 --> 00:26:26.260 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:30.250 align:middle line:84%
So this procedure
can actually be

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:37.650 align:middle line:84%
represented diagrammatically,
be represented diagrammatically.

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And I will just
introduce a single line,

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.530 align:middle line:84%
just introduce a
single line for GF--

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:48.500 align:middle line:90%
say, x and y--

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:54.930 align:middle line:90%
for GF 0 x minus y.

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:58.410 align:middle line:84%
So we just represent
the line like that.

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:00.360 align:middle line:90%
So if I use that--

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.680 align:middle line:84%
and then we can write them
in the diagrammatic form,

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:09.480 align:middle line:84%
then the first term
is just x1, x2.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:13.390 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Another second term would
be 3 multiply 4 factorial.

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:23.610 align:middle line:84%
So this is i lambda
divided by 8.

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you have x1
times x1, x2 then times--

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:33.000 align:middle line:90%
this contracted with itself.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.400 align:middle line:90%
And so you have two propagator.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:39.130 align:middle line:84%
One is contracted like that,
and one is contracted like that.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:41.760 align:middle line:90%
And this point is x.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:48.500 align:middle line:84%
So you have x, but they
all contract with itself.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's x minus x for this one
and x minus x for that one.

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:55.450 align:middle line:90%


00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And then similarly,
of course, this

00:27:57.070 --> 00:28:02.230 align:middle line:84%
is identical to that, is
i lambda divided by 8.

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:11.460 align:middle line:90%
So this is times, so x1, x2 x.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:15.540 align:middle line:90%
And then the last one--

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.480 align:middle line:90%
so this one corresponding to--

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.360 align:middle line:90%
so now this is 12 divided by 24.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:26.130 align:middle line:90%
This is minus i 2 lambda--

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:29.630 align:middle line:90%
i lambda divided by 2.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:33.920 align:middle line:90%
So x1 is to x, x and x2 to x.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And then you have something
like this, x1, x2.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.430 align:middle line:90%


00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:42.570 align:middle line:90%
So this here is x.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:51.780 align:middle line:84%
So x1 x, x2 x, and
then x to itself.

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And then you have all
the lambda squared.

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:59.670 align:middle line:90%


00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:03.860 align:middle line:84%
So this-- again,
these two terms--

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.020 align:middle line:84%
as we already said,
these two terms cancel.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And then you just get
these two terms, just

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.183 align:middle line:90%
get these two terms.

00:29:11.183 --> 00:29:14.500 align:middle line:90%


00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And we see that each factor of
H I or each factor of S I you

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:22.070 align:middle line:90%
bring down--

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:25.550 align:middle line:84%
so each factor of H
I or each factor of--

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:29.963 align:middle line:84%
you bring down corresponding to
a interacting vertex like this,

00:29:29.963 --> 00:29:31.880 align:middle line:84%
corresponding to interaction
vertex like this.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:35.300 align:middle line:90%
You have four legs or phi's.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And so we call this
interaction vertex.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:55.170 align:middle line:90%


00:29:55.170 --> 00:30:01.930 align:middle line:84%
So in practice, it's
actually much easier

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:06.040 align:middle line:84%
to just draw the diagram first,
and then from the diagram,

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.960 align:middle line:84%
to write down the
analytic expression.

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Because the diagram is
much more intuitive.

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, what's happening
here, whatever terms here,

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.880 align:middle line:84%
you just find all possible
way to contract them.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And then diagrammatically, we
can just do it diagrammatically

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.010 align:middle line:84%
through all possible
way to contract them.

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:28.580 align:middle line:84%
That's much easier to
do by drawing a diagram

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:32.960 align:middle line:90%
than by doing the counting.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:51.415 align:middle line:84%
So in practice, much easier
to draw the diagram first.

00:30:51.415 --> 00:30:55.430 align:middle line:90%


00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:57.155 align:middle line:84%
You just draw all
possible diagrams.

00:30:57.155 --> 00:31:01.360 align:middle line:90%


00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And then from diagram,
write down the expressions.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:24.970 align:middle line:90%


00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:29.770 align:middle line:84%
So those diagrams are just
called the Feynman diagrams.

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:31.780 align:middle line:84%
So we just draw
possible diagrams.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And then from the diagrams,
we write down the expressions.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:36.010 align:middle line:90%
That's called the Feynman rules.

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:36.970 align:middle line:90%
I gave you a diagram.

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:38.553 align:middle line:84%
Then there's a rule
which convert them

00:31:38.553 --> 00:31:40.660 align:middle line:90%
into such kind of expression.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:44.590 align:middle line:84%
We can convert them into
such kind of expression.

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:47.580 align:middle line:84%
So now let's give
you an example.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.490 align:middle line:84%
So now let's give
you an example.

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:52.858 align:middle line:84%
So now let's look at the
example in the second order.

00:31:52.858 --> 00:31:54.775 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the example
in the second order.

00:31:54.775 --> 00:31:58.180 align:middle line:90%


00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So let's consider order
lambda squared example.

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:10.610 align:middle line:90%


00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:14.020 align:middle line:84%
So the lambda squared,
there are many terms.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So one of the term
is just to say

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:21.720 align:middle line:90%
you now have H I squared here.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.220 align:middle line:84%
You also have
downstairs, et cetera.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:24.095 align:middle line:90%
There are many terms.

00:32:24.095 --> 00:32:25.335 align:middle line:90%
But one of the term--

00:32:25.335 --> 00:32:28.050 align:middle line:90%


00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:29.290 align:middle line:90%
yeah, let me just say here.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:32.750 align:middle line:84%
So one of the term just x and
then you have H I squared here.

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:33.750 align:middle line:90%
This is one of the term.

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.110 align:middle line:90%
They also have other terms.

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:40.030 align:middle line:84%
So let's now look at just
that term as example.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:42.940 align:middle line:84%
So at the lambda
squared example,

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:46.030 align:middle line:90%
there's a term like this.

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:49.750 align:middle line:84%
1 factorial-- 1 factorial, when
you expand this to the second

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:51.820 align:middle line:90%
order, then this--

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:55.480 align:middle line:90%
yeah, a 1/2.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:33:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And then you have minus i
lambda 4 factorial squared

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.560 align:middle line:84%
because now this coefficient
also expand to second order.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And then you have d4 x d4 y
x1 x2 phi 4 x phi 4 y here.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.905 align:middle line:84%
So now one of the
term is like this.

00:33:21.905 --> 00:33:28.950 align:middle line:90%


00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So later, we don't even need
to write down such a term.

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:34.590 align:middle line:84%
We just immediately write
down all the diagram.

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Just here, to help you to
understand the process,

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:43.240 align:middle line:84%
let's just say let's look
at this particular term.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:47.610 align:middle line:84%
So now let's try to write
down all possible contractions

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:52.900 align:middle line:84%
by just using diagrams,
just by using diagrams.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:59.875 align:middle line:84%
So now we have x1, x2, and the
four phi-- four x and four y's.

00:33:59.875 --> 00:34:01.750 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, you have
something like this.

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:04.780 align:middle line:90%
You have x1.

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:06.100 align:middle line:90%
You have x2.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:09.159 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
two external points.

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:13.345 align:middle line:84%
And then now you have
four phi's coming from x

00:34:13.345 --> 00:34:16.489 align:middle line:90%
and four phi's come from y.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:20.850 align:middle line:84%
So we need to connect, find
all possible ways to connect.

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:22.830 align:middle line:84%
We find all possible
ways to connect.

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:28.800 align:middle line:90%
So that's the goal.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.580 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.754 align:middle line:84%
So here are the
all possible ways--

00:34:33.754 --> 00:34:36.540 align:middle line:90%


00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.870 align:middle line:84%
so here are the
all possible ways.

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:46.159 align:middle line:84%
So first-- there are actually
five in inequivalent way.

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:48.000 align:middle line:90%
So let me just write them down.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.139 align:middle line:84%
So the first one is you
just connect one of them

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:53.870 align:middle line:90%
to x and one of them to x--

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:56.810 align:middle line:90%
yeah, one of the x--

00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:58.200 align:middle line:84%
yeah, let me just
draw them down.

00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.140 align:middle line:90%
So one of them is the following.

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.495 align:middle line:90%
So you take one of the x--

00:35:02.495 --> 00:35:06.090 align:middle line:90%


00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:08.100 align:middle line:90%
so there are five of them.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Let me write equal sign here.

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:15.280 align:middle line:84%
So each one of them, let me
give a label for later use.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:20.070 align:middle line:84%
So here, you can
have, say, x1 and x2.

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Then they can connect to x.

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.400 align:middle line:90%
And then x can connect to y.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.890 align:middle line:90%
So this is one of them.

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:33.600 align:middle line:90%


00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And the second one
possibility is you

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:46.970 align:middle line:84%
just x1 connect to x
and x2 to connect to y.

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:48.170 align:middle line:90%
And now there are three--

00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:51.800 align:middle line:90%


00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.750 align:middle line:84%
between x and the y,
we have to connect.

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:56.750 align:middle line:90%
So we have something like that.

00:35:56.750 --> 00:36:00.060 align:middle line:90%
So this is the second.

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:37.160 align:middle line:84%
So the third--
and the third way,

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:45.140 align:middle line:84%
if you connect x1 to x2
itself and then times--

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:47.330 align:middle line:84%
and then you have
to connect x and y.

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:49.910 align:middle line:90%
So there are four of them.

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:51.860 align:middle line:90%
Just connect x and y like this.

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:54.260 align:middle line:90%
You can connect them like this.

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Or you connect x1, x2 itself.

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And then you, again, have
to connect with x and y.

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Or you can connect.

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:07.222 align:middle line:84%
Then the y-- and that's
just between x and y.

00:37:07.222 --> 00:37:08.180 align:middle line:90%
You can also have that.

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:12.240 align:middle line:90%


00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.500 align:middle line:84%
So some of x is contracted
y, and some of x

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:16.635 align:middle line:90%
is contracted with itself.

00:37:16.635 --> 00:37:19.200 align:middle line:90%


00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Or you have the
last possibility.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.920 align:middle line:90%
So you have x1, x2.

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.720 align:middle line:84%
But then the x just
contract with itself.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And the y also
contract with itself.

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:38.240 align:middle line:90%


00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.950 align:middle line:90%
So any questions on this?

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:43.970 align:middle line:84%
So these are essentially
all possible contractions

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:45.800 align:middle line:90%
you can have between them.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.730 align:middle line:90%
We just draw the diagrams.

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:52.090 align:middle line:84%
But now we also
have to calculate--

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:57.200 align:middle line:90%


00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.990 align:middle line:84%
so we also have to find
the combinatorial factors

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:02.680 align:middle line:90%
between them.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:05.350 align:middle line:84%
We also have to find the
combinatorial factors

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:06.910 align:middle line:90%
between them.

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:12.010 align:middle line:84%
So now let's try to work out
the combinatorial factors.

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:16.623 align:middle line:84%
So let me just give
you some examples.

00:38:16.623 --> 00:38:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest, I will
just write down the answer

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:22.150 align:middle line:84%
because it just take too much
time to do all the examples one

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:24.640 align:middle line:90%
by one.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:28.530 align:middle line:84%
So let's do this
one as an example.

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:30.360 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, let me just erase here.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.325 align:middle line:90%
We need space here.

00:38:32.325 --> 00:38:38.700 align:middle line:90%


00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So here, actually, there
are two possible diagrams.

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:46.595 align:middle line:84%
I can have x1 and
x2 connected to x.

00:38:46.595 --> 00:38:51.470 align:middle line:84%
I can also have x1,
x2 connected to y.

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:53.210 align:middle line:90%
Because x and y are symmetric.

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:55.130 align:middle line:90%
So I only draw one of them.

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:57.350 align:middle line:84%
So that means there's
a factor of 2.

00:38:57.350 --> 00:38:59.420 align:middle line:84%
I can either connect
to x or connect to y.

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:01.490 align:middle line:90%
So I have 1/2.

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So let me also copy this,
lambda 4 factorial squared.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:10.610 align:middle line:90%
And then I have a 2 factor.

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:13.520 align:middle line:84%
x1, x2 can either connect
to x or connect to y.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:17.310 align:middle line:90%


00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:22.110 align:middle line:84%
So x1 have four possibilities
to connect to x,

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and x2 have three
possibilities to connect to x.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:30.495 align:middle line:84%
And then the remaining phi x
then have four possibilities

00:39:30.495 --> 00:39:33.430 align:middle line:90%
to connect to y.

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And the other remaining phi
x have three possibility

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.870 align:middle line:90%
to connect to y.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, that's
your prefactors,

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:43.820 align:middle line:90%
combinatorial factors.

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And so if you worked it out,
so that give you minus lambda

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:51.750 align:middle line:90%
squared 1/2 squared.

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:54.410 align:middle line:90%


00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:55.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.012 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Why were
there four-- so after we

00:39:57.012 --> 00:39:59.215 align:middle line:84%
x1 and x2 to x, why were
there four remaining?

00:39:59.215 --> 00:39:59.840 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:04.220 align:middle line:84%
It's because now you
have two phi remaining,

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:06.020 align:middle line:90%
two phi x remaining.

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:10.110 align:middle line:84%
So two phi x remaining
have to connect with y.

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So the first phi, we have
four possibility to connect y

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.100 align:middle line:84%
because there are
four y's there.

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:16.560 align:middle line:90%
So that's this factor of 4.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And then the other phi x
have three possibilities

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:19.620 align:middle line:90%
to connect with y.

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:21.090 align:middle line:90%
And so that's the factor of 3.

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And once you do that,
then this y just

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:24.870 align:middle line:90%
have to connect with itself.

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:26.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:31.520 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Do we have a diagram
x1 to x, to x to y, y to x2,

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:34.650 align:middle line:90%
and x loop and y loop?

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:37.160 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: [LAUGHS] Which one?

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:37.940 align:middle line:90%
Say it again.

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.400 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Wait, so you should
just draw it on the board.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:41.840 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: x1 to x.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.090 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: x1 to x.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:48.860 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: And then
one loop of x, x to y.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.420 align:middle line:90%
Loop at y.

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:52.850 align:middle line:90%
And y to x2.

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:55.724 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: And y to x2.

00:40:55.724 --> 00:40:57.560 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Oh, we
didn't include the--

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:00.950 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, let me see.

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:02.385 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:02.385 --> 00:41:04.010 align:middle line:84%
I should also have
a diagram like this.

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:05.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's possible.

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:07.970 align:middle line:90%
I think I just forgot it.

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:08.480 align:middle line:90%
Let me see.

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.010 align:middle line:90%
Do I have something like this?

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:12.530 align:middle line:84%
No, actually-- yeah,
I think forgot it.

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:14.150 align:middle line:90%
Good, good, good.

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:15.470 align:middle line:90%
This diagram is here.

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:17.660 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this is b prime.

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:19.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.150 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:21.830 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Thank you.

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:24.530 align:middle line:90%
So we can also have that.

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:25.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Here, it's really
for the illustration.

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:30.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- actually, I should
claim at the beginning,

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:36.380 align:middle line:84%
I didn't aim for completeness
and just for illustration.

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Because if we try
to be too complete,

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:43.020 align:middle line:84%
then that may take
too much time.

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:43.790 align:middle line:90%
OK, good, good.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:45.670 align:middle line:90%
This is also a possibility.

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:50.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes, good job.

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And so now let's
look at this one.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.010 align:middle line:90%
So now let's look at this one.

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:07.040 align:middle line:84%
So again, let's copy this 1/2
minus i divided by 4 factorial

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.840 align:middle line:90%
squared--

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:13.660 align:middle line:84%
and then the
combinatorial factors.

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:15.070 align:middle line:90%
Again, I can have the freedom--

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:18.970 align:middle line:84%
so x1 either connect
to x or connect to y.

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:21.430 align:middle line:84%
That two diagram
would be the same.

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:23.110 align:middle line:90%
And so I have two possibilities.

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Here, I only draw one of them
because I just flipped them

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:29.200 align:middle line:90%
because x and y are symmetric.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.930 align:middle line:90%
So I have a factor of 2.

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And then the x1 will
have four opportunities

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:38.650 align:middle line:90%
to connect with four of x.

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And x2 have four possibilities
to connect four of y

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:43.570 align:middle line:90%
because x2 connect with y.

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:46.510 align:middle line:90%
So I have two factors, 4 and 4.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:50.590 align:middle line:90%


00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:52.550 align:middle line:90%
And so after that--

00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:55.840 align:middle line:84%
so phi x have three left
and phi y have three left.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And then take one
of the phi, then

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.650 align:middle line:84%
have three possibilities
you can connect to y.

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:05.470 align:middle line:90%
And the other one have two.

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:07.510 align:middle line:90%
And then that's it.

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:08.950 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:11.470 align:middle line:90%
So that all the possibilities.

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:13.370 align:middle line:90%
And if you work it out--

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:18.480 align:middle line:84%
so this gives you lambda
squared divided by 3 factorial.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And then-- so as an exercise,
you should work out this one

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.760 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, which I didn't
work out, but I did

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:31.770 align:middle line:90%
work out this one.

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:35.440 align:middle line:84%
So this one I also
give you an exercise,

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.400 align:middle line:84%
so this is minus
1/2 lambda squared

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:45.240 align:middle line:84%
4 factorial squared times
4 times 3 times 2 equal

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:50.400 align:middle line:84%
to minus 1/2 lambda squared
divided by 4 factorial.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.750 align:middle line:90%
And so this one is the--

00:43:53.750 --> 00:44:01.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, minus 1/2 lambda squared 4
factorial squared times 2 times

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:04.050 align:middle line:90%
3 times 2 times 3.

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:09.530 align:middle line:84%
So that gives you minus
lambda squared divided by 16.

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:14.680 align:middle line:84%
So this final one is
minus 1/2 lambda squared

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:23.070 align:middle line:84%
divided by 4 factorial
squared times 3 squared--

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:28.225 align:middle line:84%
and then given by minus lambda
squared divided by 2 1/8

00:44:28.225 --> 00:44:28.725 align:middle line:90%
squared.

00:44:28.725 --> 00:44:33.740 align:middle line:90%


00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:34.250 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:35.470 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:39.640 align:middle line:84%
So I write them down just for
you to check yourself later.

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So I let you do this as
an exercise for yourself,

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:49.920 align:middle line:84%
to do this exercise
later yourself.

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So here, we can already
observe some patterns

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.205 align:middle line:84%
So here, we can
observe some patterns.

00:44:56.205 --> 00:44:58.710 align:middle line:90%


00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And so you can do this for
each individual diagrams.

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:10.840 align:middle line:84%
But if you try to
count this way,

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.690 align:middle line:84%
if you try to count it this
way, as we are doing here,

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:17.750 align:middle line:84%
even though it's not difficult
to do, but it's still tedious.

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:19.300 align:middle line:90%
It's still tedious.

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Each diagram have to count
the factor of 4, 3, et cetera.

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:25.360 align:middle line:84%
So it'd be nice if you
find a better trick.

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:27.790 align:middle line:84%
So now there's a
better way to do it,

00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:33.580 align:middle line:84%
so the better way to
do it, so better trick.

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:37.090 align:middle line:90%


00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:39.515 align:middle line:84%
So it's by notice
the following--

00:45:39.515 --> 00:45:43.320 align:middle line:90%


00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:49.040 align:middle line:84%
so when you go to the lambda
n-th order, so there's always--

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:53.360 align:middle line:84%
there's an n factorial coming
from expanding the exponential.

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:56.010 align:middle line:90%


00:45:56.010 --> 00:46:00.360 align:middle line:84%
So because we are expanding
the exponential and the--

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:10.950 align:middle line:90%


00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:20.370 align:middle line:84%
so there's always a factorial
come from the expanding of--

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:24.580 align:middle line:90%
so now at n-th order--

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:27.230 align:middle line:90%


00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:29.640 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I think I
erased my vertex.

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:33.740 align:middle line:84%
So at the n-th order,
you have an n factorial

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:36.590 align:middle line:84%
from exponential, but
you also have n vertices.

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Because each power, each
lambda comes with a factor

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.075 align:middle line:90%
of these vertices.

00:46:41.075 --> 00:46:45.110 align:middle line:90%


00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:53.430 align:middle line:84%
So now when you permute all
these n, so when you permute

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:55.290 align:middle line:90%
the n interacting vertices--

00:46:55.290 --> 00:47:10.250 align:middle line:90%


00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:14.690 align:middle line:84%
and you also get the
factor of n factorial

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:16.280 align:middle line:90%
because they're all symmetric.

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:18.960 align:middle line:84%
They're all symmetric,
doing the contraction.

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you have one way
to contract, and then

00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:23.720 align:middle line:84%
you can have another way
to contract by permuting

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:24.950 align:middle line:90%
all these different vertices.

00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:27.760 align:middle line:90%


00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.515 align:middle line:84%
So then these two
factors cancel.

00:47:29.515 --> 00:47:38.530 align:middle line:90%


00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:40.105 align:middle line:84%
These two functions
are also modulo.

00:47:40.105 --> 00:47:45.330 align:middle line:90%


00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Modulo symmetries in
permuting vertices--

00:47:52.470 --> 00:48:02.310 align:middle line:90%


00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:04.440 align:middle line:84%
if there are
symmetries in permuting

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:09.960 align:middle line:84%
vertices, then, of course,
you don't get n factorial.

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Because some of the permutations
give you the same diagram.

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And so the modulo symmetries
in permuting vertices--

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:20.310 align:middle line:90%
then you have this n factorial.

00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:22.080 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
first observation.

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:25.390 align:middle line:90%


00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:29.560 align:middle line:84%
So the second
observation is that

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:38.860 align:middle line:84%
for each vertex which you
have minus i lambda divided

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:40.915 align:middle line:90%
by 4 factorial phi 4--

00:48:40.915 --> 00:48:45.130 align:middle line:90%


00:48:45.130 --> 00:49:25.110 align:middle line:84%
so if each phi in this phi
4 contracts differently,

00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:26.520 align:middle line:90%
contracts differently--

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:31.400 align:middle line:90%


00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:34.510 align:middle line:84%
so all these four phi's are
symmetric with each other.

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:37.360 align:middle line:84%
There's not any phi
which is special.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:41.440 align:middle line:84%
But if each phi
contracts differently,

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:46.990 align:middle line:84%
then again, you permute the
phi's, it should be the same--

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:48.895 align:middle line:90%
should lead to a--

00:49:48.895 --> 00:49:50.500 align:middle line:84%
that diagram should
also be included.

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:55.250 align:middle line:90%


00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:56.810 align:middle line:90%
And then you can permute phi.

00:49:56.810 --> 00:50:02.010 align:middle line:90%


00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Permutation of 4 phi's
then leads to 4 factorial.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.030 align:middle line:90%


00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:24.200 align:middle line:84%
So, again, modulo-- so
this 4 factorial again

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:27.750 align:middle line:90%
cancels with this 4 factorial.

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:46.660 align:middle line:84%
So the two 4 factorial
cancel modulo symmetries

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:56.780 align:middle line:84%
in permuting phi's coming
from the same vertex.

00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:07.310 align:middle line:90%


00:51:07.310 --> 00:51:09.838 align:middle line:84%
Again, so if these two
phi's are contracted

00:51:09.838 --> 00:51:11.630 align:middle line:84%
the same-- of course,
when you permute them

00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:14.210 align:middle line:90%
you don't generate new diagram.

00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:16.980 align:middle line:90%
You don't generate new ways.

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:21.170 align:middle line:84%
So now we have two
different permutations.

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:24.290 align:middle line:84%
One is to permute the
vertices, and the second

00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:27.410 align:middle line:84%
is to permute the phi's
within each vertex.

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:30.470 align:middle line:90%


00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:36.570 align:middle line:84%
So that means both of these
n factorial and these 4

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:40.150 align:middle line:90%
factorial, they cancel.

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:41.470 align:middle line:90%
So we can forget--

00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:53.810 align:middle line:84%
so this means forget about
the n factorial factor

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:54.920 align:middle line:90%
from exponential.

00:51:54.920 --> 00:52:02.680 align:middle line:90%


00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And we also forget about
this 1 over 4 factorial.

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And then treat each
vertex minus i lambda,

00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:25.320 align:middle line:84%
just coming from a
factor of minus i lambda.

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:27.510 align:middle line:84%
But then this way,
we over-count.

00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:30.980 align:middle line:90%


00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:33.470 align:middle line:90%
So this way, we over-count.

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:34.820 align:middle line:90%
And then we need to divide--

00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:41.980 align:middle line:90%


00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:44.340 align:middle line:90%
so we need to divide.

00:52:44.340 --> 00:53:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And then divide by
symmetry factors

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:28.290 align:middle line:84%
from permuting
vertices and the legs.

00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:31.260 align:middle line:90%


00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:31.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:36.450 align:middle line:90%


00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:36.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:39.275 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go back
to this diagram.

00:53:39.275 --> 00:53:42.068 align:middle line:90%


00:53:42.068 --> 00:53:43.610 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go back
to this diagram.

00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:46.240 align:middle line:90%


00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:51.330 align:middle line:84%
So in this diagram, there's
no symmetry between x and y.

00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:54.840 align:middle line:90%


00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Because x and y,
they're not symmetric.

00:53:57.870 --> 00:53:59.230 align:middle line:90%
So we don't need to divide--

00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:01.230 align:middle line:84%
so there's no symmetry
factor associated

00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:07.960 align:middle line:90%
with permuting the vertices.

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:11.410 align:middle line:84%
But for the vertex
come from the x,

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:15.310 align:middle line:90%
these two legs are symmetric.

00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:18.460 align:middle line:84%
So there's a factor
of 2 permute them.

00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And for this thing
come from y-- again,

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.820 align:middle line:84%
there are two of
them-- are symmetric.

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:30.430 align:middle line:84%
so That's why we divided by 2
symmetric factors, so this 1/2.

00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, from here,
again, the x and the y,

00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:36.560 align:middle line:90%
they are asymmetric.

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Because one is contracted
with x1 and one

00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:41.720 align:middle line:90%
is contracted with x2.

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:52.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's no symmetry factors
from commuting from vertices.

00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:58.560 align:middle line:84%
But between x and y, there are
three legs which are symmetric.

00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:00.840 align:middle line:84%
When we permute, this
three legs, and then we

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:03.490 align:middle line:90%
have three factorials.

00:55:03.490 --> 00:55:06.700 align:middle line:90%
So we have three factorials.

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, I leave
as exercise for you

00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:16.890 align:middle line:84%
to do the other diagrams,
to do the other diagrams.

00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:27.980 align:middle line:84%
So now we are ready to
just write down our rule.

00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So now we have
drawn the diagrams.

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And now we can use the diagram
to write down expressions.

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:55.580 align:middle line:84%
So the rules of writing down
expression from diagrams

00:55:55.580 --> 00:56:06.110 align:middle line:84%
are called the Feynman
rules, the Feynman rules.

00:56:06.110 --> 00:56:08.780 align:middle line:90%
So here is the Feynman rules.

00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:16.210 align:middle line:90%
So here is the Feynman rules

00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:18.000 align:middle line:90%
So these are all very intuitive.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.390 align:middle line:90%


00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:25.080 align:middle line:90%
So for each external point--

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:28.130 align:middle line:84%
so here, we have
some external points.

00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:40.030 align:middle line:84%
So each external point, you
associate it with a line.

00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So here is the,
say, for example x1.

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And then you just associate
with a factor of 1.

00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:50.290 align:middle line:84%
But there's always a line
coming out of the external point

00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:52.100 align:middle line:84%
because you have to
contract with that one.

00:56:52.100 --> 00:57:00.340 align:middle line:90%


00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And then for each propagator,
for the propagator,

00:57:07.550 --> 00:57:09.260 align:middle line:90%
we already wrote down.

00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:12.710 align:middle line:84%
You just have-- say, you
have two endpoint, then

00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:18.130 align:middle line:84%
that's corresponding
to GF 0 minus y.

00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:22.360 align:middle line:84%
So each such propagator,
you can just write down

00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:26.665 align:middle line:90%
a factor corresponding to GF y.

00:57:26.665 --> 00:57:35.900 align:middle line:90%


00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:37.250 align:middle line:90%
And then for each vertex--

00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:46.800 align:middle line:90%


00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.030 align:middle line:90%
I think I can erase them.

00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:56.570 align:middle line:90%


00:57:56.570 --> 00:57:57.700 align:middle line:90%
So for each vertex--

00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:08.860 align:middle line:90%


00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:11.700 align:middle line:90%
so at point x--

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:14.685 align:middle line:84%
so you associate with lambda
and then integration over x.

00:58:14.685 --> 00:58:17.325 align:middle line:90%


00:58:17.325 --> 00:58:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And then the last step, you
divide by symmetry factors,

00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:33.240 align:middle line:90%
symmetry factors for diagram.

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:36.560 align:middle line:84%
So you just draw all
possible diagrams

00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:38.010 align:middle line:90%
using this kind of rule.

00:58:38.010 --> 00:58:39.800 align:middle line:84%
So for each propagator,
you have a line,

00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:43.280 align:middle line:90%
and then you have vertices.

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So now, from each diagram,
by applying this rule,

00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:49.050 align:middle line:84%
we can also write down
the analytic expression.

00:58:49.050 --> 00:58:52.930 align:middle line:84%
We can write down
analytic expression.

00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:53.935 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:58:53.935 --> 00:59:00.650 align:middle line:90%


00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:04.850 align:middle line:84%
So exercise for yourself to
write down analytic expression

00:59:04.850 --> 00:59:06.140 align:middle line:90%
for each of them.

00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, let me
give you an example.

00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:17.010 align:middle line:84%
So for b, as an
exercise, you should

00:59:17.010 --> 00:59:18.610 align:middle line:84%
try to do yourself
for each of them.

00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Let me just give you
one example for b.

00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And then you have first
the symmetric factors,

00:59:25.110 --> 00:59:29.570 align:middle line:84%
lambda squared divided
by 3 factorial.

00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And then you have d4 x d4 y
come from these two vertices.

00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I should just
write it like this.

00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:40.880 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:43.880 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let me just
strictly follow this rule.

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:44.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:47.130 align:middle line:90%
So we have two vertices.

00:59:47.130 --> 00:59:50.810 align:middle line:84%
So each vertex, we
have i lambda squared.

00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:53.370 align:middle line:90%
Then you have d4 x and d4 y.

00:59:53.370 --> 00:59:56.000 align:middle line:90%


00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And then for each propagator,
we associate these.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And then we have GF 0
x minus y, then cube.

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, we
divide by symmetry factors

01:00:11.610 --> 01:00:14.710 align:middle line:84%
because there's three
permutations of them.

01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:18.360 align:middle line:90%
So we divide by 3.

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:21.150 align:middle line:84%
So this is the analytic
expression corresponding

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:21.870 align:middle line:90%
to that diagram.

01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:24.530 align:middle line:90%


01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:30.050 align:middle line:84%
So later, you don't even have
to write down such expression

01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:31.910 align:middle line:84%
in the top line I
wrote down there.

01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:34.880 align:middle line:84%
You just, at each order,
you have certain number

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.350 align:middle line:90%
of external points.

01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And then you just have
a number of vertices

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:39.630 align:middle line:90%
come from n-th order.

01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:40.672 align:middle line:90%
You just have n vertices.

01:00:40.672 --> 01:00:43.970 align:middle line:84%
So you just try to connect all
possible lines between them.

01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And then that's all
possible contributions.

01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:53.660 align:middle line:90%


01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:54.530 align:middle line:90%
Good?

01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:58.795 align:middle line:84%
So this is the Feynman
rule in coordinate space.

01:00:58.795 --> 01:01:04.560 align:middle line:90%


01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:08.960 align:middle line:84%
It's also convenient to
go to the momentum space.

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's also convenient
to go to momentum space.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:15.230 align:middle line:84%
So to go to momentum
space, then we

01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:16.820 align:middle line:84%
can define the
Fourier transform.

01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:19.660 align:middle line:90%


01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:22.280 align:middle line:84%
So let's define the
Fourier transform.

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So suppose we have
an n-point function.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Suppose we have an
n-point function Gn.

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:42.410 align:middle line:90%


01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Suppose we have an
n-point function x1, xn.

01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:58.340 align:middle line:90%


01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:01.400 align:middle line:84%
So this is just the
standard Fourier transform.

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.130 align:middle line:90%


01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:07.900 align:middle line:84%
So because of the
translation symmetry--

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:15.140 align:middle line:84%
so we expect all the
piece must be conserved.

01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Just from the conservation,
I will derive it.

01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:20.620 align:middle line:84%
But you should also be able to
expect on the general grounds

01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:22.190 align:middle line:90%
from the translation symmetry.

01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:28.330 align:middle line:84%
So we expect that there must
be a factor of the momentum

01:02:28.330 --> 01:02:35.460 align:middle line:90%
conservation coming from here.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And then we call that
coefficient Gn P.

01:02:45.650 --> 01:02:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So our convention is that for
momentum space correlation

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:53.257 align:middle line:84%
functions, we defined
without this factor,

01:02:53.257 --> 01:02:54.090 align:middle line:90%
without this factor.

01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:54.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:58.090 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: For the Feynman
rules, shouldn't it also

01:02:58.090 --> 01:02:59.958 align:middle line:90%
restrict to connected diagrams?

01:02:59.958 --> 01:03:00.750 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Oh, yeah.

01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we will talk
about that later.

01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:04.940 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we'll talk
about that later.

01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:05.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:08.560 align:middle line:84%
So here, I'm just talk
about the general rule.

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And then we will talk
about the more fine points,

01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:15.910 align:middle line:84%
how to enumerate all
possible diagrams.

01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:18.380 align:middle line:90%


01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:18.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:23.950 align:middle line:84%
So when we define the momentum
space correlation functions,

01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:27.490 align:middle line:90%
we extract out this factor.

01:03:27.490 --> 01:03:33.100 align:middle line:84%
So the reason for
to extract this out

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:36.290 align:middle line:84%
is from the momentum
conservation.

01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So to see this, to see that
there is a factor like this,

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:43.340 align:middle line:90%
it's very easy.

01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:46.040 align:middle line:84%
So because from the
translation symmetry--

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:54.450 align:middle line:90%


01:03:54.450 --> 01:04:00.860 align:middle line:84%
so the same argument that the
two-point function, the x1, x2

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:04.640 align:middle line:84%
should only be a
function of x1 minus x2.

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:07.640 align:middle line:84%
So for the n-point function
from the translation symmetry--

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:12.180 align:middle line:90%


01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:19.067 align:middle line:84%
so this, you can
just take one point

01:04:19.067 --> 01:04:20.150 align:middle line:90%
to be the reference point.

01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:29.410 align:middle line:84%
You can subtract, say, all
coordinate by the value of xn.

01:04:29.410 --> 01:04:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And then the last
argument becomes 0.

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:36.250 align:middle line:84%
So you can choose one point
that's a reference point

01:04:36.250 --> 01:04:38.500 align:middle line:84%
and subtract any
other point from it.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.055 align:middle line:90%
And that should be equivalent.

01:04:40.055 --> 01:04:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't matter where
you choose the reference point.

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So here, let's choose the
reference point to be xn.

01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:47.740 align:middle line:90%
So this should be equal to that.

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:51.230 align:middle line:90%


01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:55.920 align:middle line:84%
So now we do a
Fourier transform.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.630 align:middle line:90%
So now do a Fourier transform.

01:04:57.630 --> 01:05:00.080 align:middle line:84%
So you can easily
convince yourself--

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.540 align:middle line:84%
so when you do a Fourier
transform of this object,

01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:06.420 align:middle line:84%
when you plug this
into here, when

01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:10.110 align:middle line:84%
you plug this into here, and
then you get a delta function.

01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So this as a simple
exercise for yourself to do.

01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:17.192 align:middle line:84%
And so if you plug in here,
you find that there's always

01:05:17.192 --> 01:05:17.900 align:middle line:90%
a delta function.

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:21.860 align:middle line:90%


01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:24.070 align:middle line:84%
So now I record
that the momentum

01:05:24.070 --> 01:05:30.180 align:middle line:84%
space, the Feynman propagator
for the free theory

01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:35.730 align:middle line:84%
in the momentum
space, if you say k,

01:05:35.730 --> 01:05:40.470 align:middle line:84%
then it's given by
minus i k squared plus

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:42.700 align:middle line:90%
m squared minus i epsilon.

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:47.730 align:middle line:84%
So now you have a line, but
now it's labeled by momentum k.

01:05:47.730 --> 01:05:49.680 align:middle line:90%
Line labeled by momentum k.

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:52.050 align:middle line:84%
So this k denotes the
flow of the direction

01:05:52.050 --> 01:05:53.640 align:middle line:90%
of the momentum, this arrow.

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:58.750 align:middle line:90%


01:05:58.750 --> 01:05:59.250 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:05.220 align:middle line:84%
So now, with this rule, you can
easily write down what is the--

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:18.510 align:middle line:84%
now you can just
translate right.

01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:21.600 align:middle line:90%


01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:22.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:26.370 align:middle line:84%
So this is the one
point and another point.

01:06:26.370 --> 01:06:28.727 align:middle line:90%
And the third point--

01:06:28.727 --> 01:06:30.810 align:middle line:84%
so let me just-- in order
to go to momentum space,

01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:34.020 align:middle line:84%
let's just mention
several points.

01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:38.910 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, anyway, here is
one point and then here

01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:40.720 align:middle line:90%
is another point.

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.355 align:middle line:84%
And also, now let's
look at the vertex.

01:06:42.355 --> 01:06:45.600 align:middle line:90%


01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:53.720 align:middle line:84%
So at each vertex,
we have integration.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:56.610 align:middle line:90%


01:06:56.610 --> 01:06:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So suppose we have
a vertex like this.

01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:05.580 align:middle line:84%
So here is x And this is
contracted with y1, y2, y3, y4.

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So let's imagine-- so we
have a vertex like this,

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:13.140 align:middle line:84%
these four phi's contracted
with four different y's.

01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And then at such
a vertex, then we

01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:27.960 align:middle line:84%
will have expression like
this, GF 0 x minus y1 GF 0

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:39.220 align:middle line:84%
x minus y2 and GF 0 x
minus y3 GF 0 x minus y4.

01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:45.220 align:middle line:90%


01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And now again-- so now when
you plug in the expression--

01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:54.150 align:middle line:90%


01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:57.150 align:middle line:84%
so now if you plug in
the expression-- so

01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:58.710 align:middle line:84%
I will not write
all the lines here.

01:07:58.710 --> 01:08:02.145 align:middle line:84%
I think you will just
see the basic idea.

01:08:02.145 --> 01:08:05.450 align:middle line:90%


01:08:05.450 --> 01:08:07.810 align:middle line:90%
So this one, if you write down--

01:08:07.810 --> 01:08:10.420 align:middle line:84%
let's write each of them
in terms of momentum space.

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.940 align:middle line:90%


01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:15.220 align:middle line:84%
So this, if you write in
terms of momentum space,

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:22.630 align:middle line:84%
then you get a d 4 k1
exponential i k1 times

01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:29.830 align:middle line:90%
x minus y1, then GF 0 k1--

01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:32.229 align:middle line:84%
and similarly for that
and for that, for that.

01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:37.050 align:middle line:90%


01:08:37.050 --> 01:08:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And now these have
exponential i k1.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.560 align:middle line:84%
So these have the
exponential i k2.

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So these have
exponential i k3 x.

01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And these have
exponential i k4 x.

01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
other x dependence.

01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:52.439 align:middle line:90%
And then you have a d4x here.

01:08:52.439 --> 01:08:54.855 align:middle line:84%
So what do you get then is
just get a delta function.

01:08:54.855 --> 01:09:06.939 align:middle line:90%


01:09:06.939 --> 01:09:10.189 align:middle line:84%
So you just get
a delta function.

01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:13.689 align:middle line:84%
So when you do that, when
you go to momentum space,

01:09:13.689 --> 01:09:16.359 align:middle line:84%
then you find that this
should always be proportional.

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:25.840 align:middle line:90%


01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:40.549 align:middle line:84%
So that means momentum is
conserved at each vertex.

01:09:40.549 --> 01:09:46.310 align:middle line:90%


01:09:46.310 --> 01:09:47.389 align:middle line:90%
So if I draw--

01:09:47.389 --> 01:09:50.750 align:middle line:90%


01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:57.460 align:middle line:90%
so k1 here, k2, k3--

01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:59.963 align:middle line:84%
so I use the same
convention for all of them.

01:09:59.963 --> 01:10:02.380 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter whether you
draw it outgoing or ingoing.

01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:05.440 align:middle line:84%
But we draw the same
convention for all of them.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And then they
should have to be--

01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:11.500 align:middle line:84%
then they should be proportional
to a factor of this.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:15.410 align:middle line:90%


01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And here, it doesn't
matter what is yi.

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So y1, y2, y3, y4,
they can either

01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:23.535 align:middle line:84%
be some external point or
some other internal point.

01:10:23.535 --> 01:10:28.730 align:middle line:90%


01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:29.836 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:10:29.836 --> 01:10:38.520 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: With Gn of t object,
the n-point function in space,

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:40.770 align:middle line:84%
can you get that by
writing expectation values

01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:47.410 align:middle line:84%
of the momentum field operators,
like pi k1, pi x1, pi x2?

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:47.910 align:middle line:90%
Or is that--

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:48.060 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:48.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you can.

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:49.475 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you can.

01:10:49.475 --> 01:10:51.600 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: And how would
you do time ordering there?

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:52.470 align:middle line:90%
Because then--

01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:55.830 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, you--

01:10:55.830 --> 01:11:01.260 align:middle line:84%
so this is strictly
defined in terms of the--

01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:01.770 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

01:11:01.770 --> 01:11:06.190 align:middle line:84%
So no, you cannot write
that way in the sense that--

01:11:06.190 --> 01:11:07.210 align:middle line:90%
not as a whole momentum.

01:11:07.210 --> 01:11:07.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:08.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, no, you can not that way.

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:09.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:10.932 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: So you to find--

01:11:10.932 --> 01:11:13.182 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: You really have
to find the final expression

01:11:13.182 --> 01:11:14.140 align:middle line:90%
and then do the--

01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:14.640 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, for the Wightman function,
you can, not for the time

01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:18.690 align:middle line:90%
ordered.

01:11:18.690 --> 01:11:20.480 align:middle line:84%
For the Wightman
function, you can.

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:20.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:27.350 align:middle line:90%


01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:28.590 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:34.580 align:middle line:84%
So now we can write down the
momentum space Feynman rule.

01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:39.160 align:middle line:90%


01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And we will not have
time to do an example.

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Let me just write
them down, and then we

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:49.490 align:middle line:84%
will look at the
example next time.

01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:56.410 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

01:11:56.410 --> 01:12:06.430 align:middle line:84%
So here is the rule to
compute this Gn p1 pn.

01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:10.870 align:middle line:90%
We use the following rule.

01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:13.735 align:middle line:84%
So first, for each
external point--

01:12:13.735 --> 01:12:24.660 align:middle line:90%


01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:30.370 align:middle line:84%
and now you just can
associate, say, a momentum--

01:12:30.370 --> 01:12:31.680 align:middle line:90%
respect to that momentum.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And then you can associate
with a factor of 1.

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:36.930 align:middle line:90%
And then you draw a line.

01:12:36.930 --> 01:12:38.340 align:middle line:90%
You still draw a line.

01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:41.515 align:middle line:84%
But now you associate a
momentum with this line.

01:12:41.515 --> 01:12:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Because when you Fourier
transform this line,

01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:46.320 align:middle line:90%
you will have momentum.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And for each propagator, the
propagator is given by this.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.510 align:middle line:90%
So now you have a momentum.

01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And then this is given
by the momentum space.

01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:02.730 align:middle line:84%
p squared plus m
squared minus epsilon.

01:13:02.730 --> 01:13:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And then now for each vertex,
you have a factor of i lambda.

01:13:16.170 --> 01:13:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And then you impose a
momentum conservation.

01:13:18.510 --> 01:13:28.470 align:middle line:90%


01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:29.250 align:middle line:90%
at each vertex.

01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:33.600 align:middle line:90%


01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:38.940 align:middle line:84%
So now, remember, when we
do a Fourier transform,

01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:44.190 align:middle line:84%
each propagator, each line,
will have a momentum integration

01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:49.440 align:middle line:84%
because each one of them is
integrated over momentum.

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.300 align:middle line:84%
So each one of
them is associated

01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:53.280 align:middle line:90%
with a momentum integration.

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And now, some of those
momentum integration

01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:58.680 align:middle line:84%
can be get rid of by
imposing the delta function

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:00.120 align:middle line:90%
at the vertex.

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.730 align:middle line:84%
So you can get rid
of some of them

01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:06.090 align:middle line:84%
by momentum conservation
at the vertex using

01:14:06.090 --> 01:14:08.250 align:middle line:90%
the delta functions.

01:14:08.250 --> 01:14:12.000 align:middle line:84%
But now you will have,
say, a number of them left.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:21.180 align:middle line:84%
So then you need
to integrate over

01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:23.910 align:middle line:90%
each undetermined momentum.

01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:36.940 align:middle line:90%


01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:40.000 align:middle line:84%
So each undetermined
momentum you

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.560 align:middle line:84%
need to integrate
with this factor.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:44.770 align:middle line:90%


01:14:44.770 --> 01:14:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And then the same thing,
you need to divide it

01:14:46.930 --> 01:14:48.950 align:middle line:90%
by symmetry factor.

01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:51.700 align:middle line:84%
So symmetry factor is
the same in coordinate

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:54.640 align:middle line:90%
or in momentum space.

01:14:54.640 --> 01:15:01.550 align:middle line:90%


01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:06.350 align:middle line:84%
So this is the way which you can
write down the momentum space

01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:10.100 align:middle line:84%
expression for each
diagram, momentum space

01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:12.650 align:middle line:90%
expression for each step.

01:15:12.650 --> 01:15:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Actually, maybe we
still have some time.

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.190 align:middle line:90%
So we have a couple minutes.

01:15:19.190 --> 01:15:20.975 align:middle line:90%
So we can just do this example.

01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:24.030 align:middle line:90%


01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:27.030 align:middle line:90%
We can just do this example.

01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:28.730 align:middle line:84%
So this example,
let's see what it

01:15:28.730 --> 01:15:30.140 align:middle line:90%
looks like in momentum space.

01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:33.380 align:middle line:90%


01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:40.610 align:middle line:90%
So in momentum space, we just--

01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:43.170 align:middle line:90%


01:15:43.170 --> 01:15:46.541 align:middle line:90%
but I erase the diagram.

01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:55.390 align:middle line:90%


01:15:55.390 --> 01:16:03.780 align:middle line:84%
So this diagram looks like this
in coordinate space of x1, x2

01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:06.720 align:middle line:90%
and x and y.

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Now when we go to momentum
space, the diagram is the same.

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:16.620 align:middle line:90%
Just now, we label the momentum.

01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So we have an external line
here, a terminal point here.

01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:22.710 align:middle line:90%
So here, I have a momentum, p1.

01:16:22.710 --> 01:16:25.680 align:middle line:90%
Here, I have a momentum, p2.

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:30.330 align:middle line:84%
So now let's just
call, say, this k1, k2.

01:16:30.330 --> 01:16:32.950 align:middle line:84%
You can assign momentum
direction as you want.

01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:33.450 align:middle line:90%
Say k3.

01:16:33.450 --> 01:16:36.210 align:middle line:90%


01:16:36.210 --> 01:16:40.950 align:middle line:84%
So now we need to impose
a momentum conservation.

01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:42.390 align:middle line:90%
So momentum flow like that.

01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:44.420 align:middle line:84%
So that means that
the p1 should be

01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:47.450 align:middle line:90%
equal to k1 plus k2 plus k3--

01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:51.890 align:middle line:90%


01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:55.850 align:middle line:84%
from the moment conservation at
this vertex And from momentum

01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:58.400 align:middle line:84%
conservation at this
vertex, they all

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.140 align:middle line:90%
go away from this vertex.

01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And then in this
case, then the p2

01:17:02.690 --> 01:17:08.930 align:middle line:84%
will be minus k1
plus k2 plus k3.

01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:12.860 align:middle line:84%
So that means, actually, p2
should be equal to minus p1.

01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:16.820 align:middle line:84%
So this makes perfect sense
because here preserves

01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:18.650 align:middle line:90%
momentum, preserves momentum.

01:17:18.650 --> 01:17:21.380 align:middle line:84%
So for momentum conservation,
if you have p1 here,

01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:23.540 align:middle line:90%
here, you should also have p1.

01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:25.710 align:middle line:84%
So p2 I drew with
a negative sign.

01:17:25.710 --> 01:17:27.035 align:middle line:90%
And so we have negative p1.

01:17:27.035 --> 01:17:31.250 align:middle line:90%


01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so using this
simplified notation,

01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:38.555 align:middle line:84%
then we can draw a
diagram like this.

01:17:38.555 --> 01:17:46.170 align:middle line:90%


01:17:46.170 --> 01:17:49.110 align:middle line:90%
So here is p.

01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:53.070 align:middle line:90%
So let's call this k1, k2.

01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And then this k3 can be
solved in terms of the k1, k2.

01:17:56.730 --> 01:18:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So this is just
the p minus k1, k2.

01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:05.070 align:middle line:90%
So this is the p minus k1, k2.

01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So now we can just write down
the momentum space expression.

01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:12.320 align:middle line:90%


01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.350 align:middle line:90%
So we have minus i lambda.

01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:15.610 align:middle line:90%
We have two vertex.

01:18:15.610 --> 01:18:18.100 align:middle line:90%
We have 2 minus lambda squared.

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Then we have two undetermined
momentum, k1, k2.

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Because this p should
be-- external momentum

01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:26.980 align:middle line:90%
should be fixed.

01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:33.220 align:middle line:90%
So we have k1 and k2.

01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:37.200 align:middle line:90%


01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And then we just write
down each propagator.

01:18:40.290 --> 01:18:42.030 align:middle line:84%
So we just write
down each propagator.

01:18:42.030 --> 01:18:47.760 align:middle line:84%
So we just have minus
i k1 squared plus m

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:50.520 align:middle line:90%
squared minus i epsilon--

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:51.870 align:middle line:90%
corresponding to this one.

01:18:51.870 --> 01:18:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And then I have minus
i k1, k2 squared

01:18:56.610 --> 01:19:12.130 align:middle line:84%
plus m squared minus
epsilon times minus i p

01:19:12.130 --> 01:19:17.905 align:middle line:84%
minus k1 k2 squared plus
m squared minus epsilon.

01:19:17.905 --> 01:19:21.670 align:middle line:90%


01:19:21.670 --> 01:19:25.390 align:middle line:90%
And then these depend on the k.

01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And then we have two factors,
so this times these two

01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:33.260 align:middle line:90%
external factors.

01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:34.540 align:middle line:90%
So this is minus--

01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:36.260 align:middle line:90%
they have the same momentum.

01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:43.150 align:middle line:84%
So we just have p squared plus
m squared minus epsilon squared.

01:19:43.150 --> 01:19:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And then we divide by 3
factorial corresponding

01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:48.850 align:middle line:90%
to the symmetric factors.

01:19:48.850 --> 01:19:49.960 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's it.

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So this is the expression for
this diagram in momentum space.

01:19:54.910 --> 01:19:58.250 align:middle line:90%


01:19:58.250 --> 01:20:01.570 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's stop here.

01:20:01.570 --> 01:20:06.000 align:middle line:90%
