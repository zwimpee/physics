00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.190 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: OK, great.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.970 align:middle line:90%
So now let's talk about QED.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:25.320 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:34.700 align:middle line:90%
And OK.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.080 align:middle line:90%
So let's first talk about QED.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.180 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And we have talked about
the Maxwell action.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.270 align:middle line:84%
So here is the
Lagrangian density.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:01:00.920 align:middle line:84%
We have F mu nu
minus J mu A mu, OK?

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And J mu should be
a conserved current

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.550 align:middle line:84%
because for the consistency
of the Maxwell equation, OK?

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Remember-- J mu has
to be conserved.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So now, the question is
what provides this J mu, OK?

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.400 align:middle line:90%
So now, let's imagine.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's introduce
some other fields.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.795 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine we have
some Dirac fermions.

00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:30.560 align:middle line:90%


00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.420 align:middle line:90%
We have some fermionic field.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.250 align:middle line:90%
Same with the Lagrangian.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:42.590 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.970 align:middle line:84%
So this is the Lagrangian
for the Dirac fermion.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And then we discussed
that for Dirac fermion--

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:84%
and then there's a
conserved current

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.570 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
global symmetry.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:07.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a U1 symmetry
corresponding to psi--

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.505 align:middle line:84%
goes to exponential i alpha psi
with alpha to be a constant.

00:02:12.505 --> 00:02:15.590 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.280 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And then this leads
to a Noether current--

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.980 align:middle line:90%
J mu, which is conserved.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:30.920 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.180 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.700 align:middle line:84%
So now, if we want to couple the
fermions to the Maxwell fields,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.710 align:middle line:84%
then it's natural we identify
this J mu with this J mu, OK?

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Because here we need
the conserved current.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And here we have a
conserved current, OK?

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's natural to
write down the theory.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Then this J mu is just
replaced by this J mu.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.780 align:middle line:84%
That's why I use
the same notation.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.910 align:middle line:84%
So then that gives us
the Lagrangian for QED.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.330 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:13.120 align:middle line:84%
We have the Maxwell,
which is the free photon.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
the free fermion.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:23.060 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.790 align:middle line:84%
But then the fermion
and the photon

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:37.840 align:middle line:84%
are coupled together
through this, OK?

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.770 align:middle line:84%
So now, this is
a cubic term, OK?

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.200 align:middle line:84%
So now, this is an
interaction term, OK?

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.970 align:middle line:84%
So now, this is an
interaction term.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And this e can
play two roles, OK?

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.860 align:middle line:84%
It can be considered as
a coupling constant--

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.030 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:84%
essentially, the e,
which just determines

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.020 align:middle line:84%
the coupling strength between
the psi and the A, OK?

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.760 align:middle line:84%
If e is bigger, then of course,
the coupling is stronger, OK?

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And the e can also
be considered--

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.680 align:middle line:90%
so it plays a dual role.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.720 align:middle line:84%
One role is you
consider as a coupling.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And the second role is you can
consider as a unit of charge.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.520 align:middle line:90%


00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.330 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.650 align:middle line:90%
A unit of charge.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Because when we talk
about the Noether current,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.190 align:middle line:90%
this is conserved.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.070 align:middle line:84%
You can multiply this
by an arbitrary number.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.680 align:middle line:90%
This is still conserved, OK?

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.850 align:middle line:90%
This-- still conserved.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And here it just means that
the unit of this current

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.860 align:middle line:90%
is given by e, OK?

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So the e plays two
roles here, OK?

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And then of course
this e is just

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.010 align:middle line:90%
our standard electric charge.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you take the
psi to be electron,

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.270 align:middle line:84%
then this will be
standard electric charge

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.280 align:middle line:84%
for the electron,
and then this will

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.330 align:middle line:84%
be a theory which
governs the interaction

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.210 align:middle line:84%
between the electron
and the photon, OK?

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.190 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.750 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.887 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:05:19.887 --> 00:05:21.720 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: How come
different particles still

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.693 align:middle line:84%
have some multiple
of the same charge?

00:05:23.693 --> 00:05:25.110 align:middle line:84%
You might think
that you could set

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.970 align:middle line:84%
the coupling constant
to any arbitrary value.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.200 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.910 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: How come
different particles

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.555 align:middle line:84%
have charges that are multiples
and different multiples--

00:05:34.555 --> 00:05:35.430 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.240 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I think
in this framework,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.130 align:middle line:84%
you can set the coupling
constant to whatever you like.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.580 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: That's right.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.122 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:05:39.122 --> 00:05:40.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So in this framework, indeed,
this e can be arbitrary.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And then different particles
can have different charge.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.280 align:middle line:84%
For example, if we couple this
to electron, this will be e e.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And then if we couple this
to muon-- so in principle, we

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.690 align:middle line:84%
have some e tilde,
which does not

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.340 align:middle line:90%
have to be the same as this e.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.090 align:middle line:90%
Indeed.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's a highly
unusual feature.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.010 align:middle line:90%


00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.260 align:middle line:84%
In nature, what we observe-- the
charge seems to be quantized.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.540 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be
multiple of some charge.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And that cannot be explained
using this framework.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.838 align:middle line:84%
It has to be explained
using some other framework,

00:06:22.838 --> 00:06:24.630 align:middle line:84%
sometimes called the
grand unified theory--

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.670 align:middle line:90%
can be used to explain that.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.910 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.860 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: So I'm confused.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.798 align:middle line:84%
In this middle
section, this J mu

00:06:32.798 --> 00:06:36.080 align:middle line:84%
is the conserved
current from the U1--

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.832 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:06:36.832 --> 00:06:38.790 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: What was the
analogy you were making?

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.078 align:middle line:84%
That it can do--
you could take it

00:06:41.078 --> 00:06:44.090 align:middle line:84%
to do the same J mu for
the Maxwell and Lagrangian?

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.200 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.960 align:middle line:90%
Just the natural implication.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.730 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: But this Lagrangian
doesn't have this U1 symmetry

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.365 align:middle line:84%
for this fermionic field because
it doesn't even exist, right?

00:06:55.365 --> 00:06:56.240 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.968 align:middle line:90%
So no, I coupled them.

00:06:58.968 --> 00:06:59.510 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.052 align:middle line:84%
So you're just taking
inspiration now

00:07:01.052 --> 00:07:02.090 align:middle line:90%
to add both of them--

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.720 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.340 align:middle line:90%
Really, that's what we do here.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.240 align:middle line:90%
We add both of them.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.240 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so we have a theory
with a photon and fermion.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And now, their coupling
is through this J.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.240 align:middle line:90%
And this J is given by this one.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:18.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.660 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.160 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.150 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.910 align:middle line:90%


00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.205 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:07:29.205 --> 00:07:30.580 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.960 align:middle line:84%
So we can also slightly
rewrite this Lagrangian

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.750 align:middle line:90%
in a somewhat different way.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.250 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:45.100 align:middle line:84%
So QED can also be written
in the following way, OK?

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.580 align:middle line:84%
So we can also rewrite
this as 1/4 F mu nu.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.070 align:middle line:90%
So this part, we don't change.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.450 align:middle line:84%
But we can actually combine
these two terms together

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.110 align:middle line:90%
in the following way.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:02.770 align:middle line:84%
We write it as i psi
bar, and then gamma mu.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I introduce a new derivative
called D mu minus m psi.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.660 align:middle line:90%
And this D mu--

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.290 align:middle line:84%
capital D mu psi is
equal to partial mu

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:24.490 align:middle line:90%
psi minus ie A mu psi, OK?

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So this is the same as
that because the first term

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.630 align:middle line:90%
here just gives you this term.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.169 align:middle line:84%
And the second term--
this e A mu psi term--

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:39.710 align:middle line:84%
just gives you this
e A mu psi bar.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:40.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle line:90%
It just gives you that, OK?

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And so mathematically, these two
are just completely equivalent.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.740 align:middle line:90%
I just slightly rewrote it.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.970 align:middle line:84%
But writing this way actually
makes one new property

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.090 align:middle line:90%
of this theory manifest, OK?

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:06.630 align:middle line:84%
So this theory-- so we
know that this theory

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.545 align:middle line:90%
has a gauge symmetry.

00:09:07.545 --> 00:09:10.520 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.965 align:middle line:84%
But this theory only has
a global symmetry, OK?

00:09:14.965 --> 00:09:16.590 align:middle line:84%
This theory only has
a global symmetry.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.710 align:middle line:84%
This alpha must
be a constant, OK?

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:23.076 align:middle line:84%
So now, when we
combine together,

00:09:23.076 --> 00:09:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and now this new
Lagrangian actually

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:32.150 align:middle line:84%
has a generalized
gauge symmetry, OK?

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:40.500 align:middle line:84%
So L max-- so L
QED turns out to be

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:48.690 align:middle line:90%
invariant under the following.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:90%


00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.340 align:middle line:90%
So still, you take A mu.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Goes to A mu plus that
partial mu lambda x.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.940 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And then now, you transform psi
also by a local transformation.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:12.000 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.100 align:middle line:84%
You transform it
by exponential i.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.420 align:middle line:90%
So now, this e is different, OK?

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.070 align:middle line:90%


00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:27.520 align:middle line:84%
So now, you can transform psi
by, actually, a local phase.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.740 align:middle line:90%
Actually now, it can depend--

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.060 align:middle line:90%
this arbitrary function lambda.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So you can show that
actually, this QED

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:36.690 align:middle line:84%
is invariant under this
transformation, OK?

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:40.840 align:middle line:90%
So if I call this A mu prime--

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.550 align:middle line:90%
if I call this psi prime x--

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.050 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.930 align:middle line:90%
So you can check yourself.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:50.190 align:middle line:84%
With this transformation,
this D mu psi--

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.440 align:middle line:90%


00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:59.180 align:middle line:90%
so this D mu prime, psi prime--

00:10:59.180 --> 00:10:59.680 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.890 align:middle line:84%
So D mu prime is
obtained by this D mu.

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:06.880 align:middle line:84%
You replace the A
mu by A mu prime.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And then here you can show that
this is equal to exponential

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:20.000 align:middle line:90%
i e lambda x D mu psi, OK?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:28.290 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out, in
this combination,

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:31.700 align:middle line:84%
so when you make such
a local transformation

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:84%
on psi, when you
take a derivative,

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.358 align:middle line:90%
then you get an extra term, OK?

00:11:39.358 --> 00:11:41.400 align:middle line:84%
You get the extra term
from taking the derivative

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.330 align:middle line:90%
on this lambda.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.490 align:middle line:84%
But when you have this
combination with A mu--

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.730 align:middle line:84%
but A mu also transforms
with additional lambda term--

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:49.690 align:middle line:90%
partial mu lambda term.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And then these two
terms just cancel, OK?

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:55.570 align:middle line:90%
So in the end, this D prime mu--

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.280 align:middle line:84%
D prime, mu prime--
actually transforms

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.892 align:middle line:90%
in a very simple way, OK?

00:11:59.892 --> 00:12:01.350 align:middle line:84%
It transforms in
a very simple way.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:04.350 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is D mu prime
any different than just

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:07.166 align:middle line:90%
D mu [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:07.166 --> 00:12:09.555 align:middle line:84%
Are we changing things
out [INAUDIBLE]??

00:12:09.555 --> 00:12:10.430 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.035 align:middle line:84%
We replaced the A
mu by A mu prime.

00:12:12.035 --> 00:12:12.577 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:12:12.577 --> 00:12:14.330 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:15.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:19.660 align:middle line:84%
So this tells you-- and then
this transforms very simply.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.410 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And then this
transforms very simply.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.978 align:middle line:84%
And psi bar-- there's
no derivative here.

00:12:26.978 --> 00:12:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Then this, straightforward,
just transforms

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:32.130 align:middle line:90%
as the exponential minus e.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:35.020 align:middle line:90%
And then we conclude.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:35.520 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:41.100 align:middle line:84%
So we conclude that
L QED is invariant

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:46.480 align:middle line:90%
under this transformation, OK?

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.555 align:middle line:90%
Indeed, it's invariant.

00:12:47.555 --> 00:12:48.055 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:48.055 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.860 align:middle line:90%
So we call it gauge invariant.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.880 align:middle line:84%
So now, this is the
generalized gauge symmetry.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.092 align:middle line:84%
Now, you also
transform the fermions.

00:13:03.092 --> 00:13:04.425 align:middle line:90%
You also transform the fermions.

00:13:04.425 --> 00:13:12.080 align:middle line:90%


00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.260 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260 align:middle line:90%
So now, we can turn it around.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.110 align:middle line:90%
So let us review our logic.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:25.130 align:middle line:84%
So we first start with
the Maxwell theory.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.360 align:middle line:84%
So the Maxwell theory--
there's a J here,

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.660 align:middle line:90%
which you need to provide.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And then from the fermionic
theory, you have another J.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And then we just combine
these two theories

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:43.550 align:middle line:84%
by replacing that J
naturally from the fermions.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:46.850 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out, when
we combine them together,

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:51.010 align:middle line:84%
this theory actually has a
generalized gauge symmetry.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:55.400 align:middle line:84%
You also now can
transform psi locally, OK?

00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:00.170 align:middle line:84%
You can transform psi locally
with this nice structure, OK?

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:02.060 align:middle line:84%
So this theory has
this nice structure.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And then now, you can
transform psi also locally.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.580 align:middle line:90%
So we can also turn this around.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:23.160 align:middle line:90%


00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.240 align:middle line:90%
So we can say--

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:30.420 align:middle line:90%


00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.240 align:middle line:84%
so if we call this
thing to be star--

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.060 align:middle line:90%


00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:53.810 align:middle line:84%
so if we require the
theory of A mu and psi

00:14:53.810 --> 00:15:11.480 align:middle line:84%
to be invariant under star, and
then that uniquely leads to--

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.900 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.460 align:middle line:90%
maybe not uniquely.

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:21.420 align:middle line:84%
That leads to the interaction
of the form J mu A mu, OK?

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.360 align:middle line:84%
It just leads to this
kind of interaction.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:24.900 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.910 align:middle line:90%
So we can turn it around.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.710 align:middle line:90%
We say, OK.

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Using a different
logic, we want to couple

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.700 align:middle line:90%
the photon and the psi together.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.550 align:middle line:84%
We want to couple A
mu and psi together.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And we know that A mu
previously has a gauge symmetry.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And now, I want to generalize
that gauge symmetry

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.590 align:middle line:90%
to include the fermions.

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And then I require
the full theory

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.340 align:middle line:84%
to be invariant
under this symmetry.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And this requirement
then requires

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:02.870 align:middle line:84%
that the interaction between
them must have this form, OK?

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Let me write more explicitly
the interaction of the form.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.540 align:middle line:90%
Psi bar gamma mu psi A mu, OK?

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.052 align:middle line:84%
So that will lead to
this kind of interaction.

00:16:14.052 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:90%


00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.820 align:middle line:84%
So the reason--
even though this is

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:28.040 align:middle line:84%
just rephrase of
what we just did,

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.630 align:middle line:84%
this rephrase is
actually powerful.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:31.130 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Here it means that when we
impose this gauge symmetry,

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.040 align:middle line:84%
we actually can deduce
the interactions.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.940 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.550 align:middle line:90%
Deduce the interactions, OK?

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.000 align:middle line:84%
We can actually deduce
the interactions.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.580 align:middle line:84%
We can fix the
interactions by requiring

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.240 align:middle line:90%
certain kinds of symmetries.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.490 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is there a
natural way to think about

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:02.596 align:middle line:84%
what would motivate you
to assert this local gauge

00:17:02.596 --> 00:17:05.265 align:middle line:90%
symmetry?

00:17:05.265 --> 00:17:05.890 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:10.540 align:middle line:90%
That's what motivates me.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:84%
Maxwell theory-- you already
have a gauge symmetry.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:15.819 align:middle line:84%
And when I couple the fermion,
I just want to generalize it.

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:19.960 align:middle line:90%


00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.319 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:22.036 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:17:22.036 --> 00:17:24.119 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I guess, instead
of a question, I guess,

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:29.685 align:middle line:84%
why is it that we know that
it should be a scalar basis?

00:17:29.685 --> 00:17:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And why couldn't it
be anything else?

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:32.460 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:36.318 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I guess
why should we know--

00:17:36.318 --> 00:17:38.068 align:middle line:84%
if you start from the
gauge symmetry going

00:17:38.068 --> 00:17:40.530 align:middle line:84%
to the interactions
logic, then why

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:44.180 align:middle line:84%
should we know that it should
be a scalar function, that it

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.630 align:middle line:90%
does all those [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Why couldn't it be
the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.210 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Because we
already have this, right?

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:56.090 align:middle line:90%
We just want to generalize this.

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:58.090 align:middle line:84%
The Maxwell theory--
we already have this.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:00.682 align:middle line:84%
We just need to generalize
this to fermion.

00:18:00.682 --> 00:18:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
natural generalization

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.307 align:middle line:84%
because the fermion is
already invariant under

00:18:04.307 --> 00:18:06.410 align:middle line:90%
the global phase symmetry.

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.020 align:middle line:84%
We just need to generalize in
the way so to make it local.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.320 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:12.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.870 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So in
quantum mechanics,

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:19.920 align:middle line:84%
when we do a single particle
in an electromagnetic field,

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.240 align:middle line:84%
the gauge transformation on
the wave function is the same.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.920 align:middle line:90%
Is there a reason why that's--

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.090 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:27.690 align:middle line:90%
It's the same.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.270 align:middle line:90%


00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:31.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.010 align:middle line:90%
There is a reason.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:37.850 align:middle line:90%


00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:38.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:49.310 align:middle line:84%
The reason is that when you
go to non relativistic case,

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:51.890 align:middle line:84%
this reduces just to one
particle-- quantum mechanics.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:53.325 align:middle line:84%
So one particle,
quantum mechanics

00:18:53.325 --> 00:18:54.950 align:middle line:84%
should also have this
kind of symmetry.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.570 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.860 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:06.125 align:middle line:84%
So this is, in fact, not
just a reinterpretation

00:19:06.125 --> 00:19:07.610 align:middle line:84%
of what we are
looking at so far.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.730 align:middle line:84%
This is actually a very deep
dynamical principle, OK?

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:18.190 align:middle line:84%
So this is, in
fact, a dynamical--

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:20.110 align:middle line:84%
a deep-- let me
emphasize that this

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:23.140 align:middle line:90%
is a deep, dynamical principle.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:31.030 align:middle line:90%


00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, you have gauge
symmetries, or in other words,

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:37.720 align:middle line:90%
local symmetries.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.210 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Can be used to determine
interactions, OK?

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:50.910 align:middle line:90%


00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:51.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Or in other words, all
interactions in nature--

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.100 align:middle line:84%
turns out, they are related
to some gauge symmetries.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:04.595 align:middle line:84%
So this applies to all
interactions in nature.

00:20:04.595 --> 00:20:10.830 align:middle line:90%


00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:17.300 align:middle line:84%
So this principle applies to
all interactions in nature, OK?

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.540 align:middle line:90%


00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:25.982 align:middle line:84%
So here we see, in the
electromagnetic interactions,

00:20:25.982 --> 00:20:27.440 align:middle line:84%
it turns out the
same thing happens

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.050 align:middle line:90%
for the weak interaction.

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Same thing happens for
the strong interaction.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
happens for gravity.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:37.520 align:middle line:84%
They all can be formulated
as a consequence

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:42.230 align:middle line:90%
of some local symmetries.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:43.977 align:middle line:90%
And why is that the case?

00:20:43.977 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:90%
We don't really know.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.710 align:middle line:84%
We don't really
understand why, somehow,

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.590 align:middle line:84%
this dynamical principle
should be there.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:55.550 align:middle line:84%
But this is just a fact that all
our fundamental interactions--

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:58.280 align:middle line:84%
they can all be
understood this way, OK?

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:04.430 align:middle line:84%
So we roughly
understand, but yeah.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:07.430 align:middle line:84%
But going into that
will be a long story.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:09.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.060 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So people
sometimes say

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.940 align:middle line:84%
that gauge invariance is an
ambiguity of the theories--

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:14.565 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:21:14.565 --> 00:21:17.280 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So you can shift
your fields by whatever,

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.870 align:middle line:90%
and the theory's invariant.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.660 align:middle line:84%
How can an ambiguity
in your description

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.240 align:middle line:84%
lead to something very physical,
which is being interacted--

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.080 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.370 align:middle line:84%
So we emphasized-- so
when you say ambiguity,

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:33.180 align:middle line:84%
this is what we said earlier,
that the local symmetries,

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.915 align:middle line:84%
or gauge symmetry-- they
just tell you your theory

00:21:36.915 --> 00:21:40.750 align:middle line:84%
that the degrees
freedom are redundant.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:41.250 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Some of the degrees
freedom is not important.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:46.380 align:middle line:84%
Then you say, this should
be pretty artificial, right?

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.838 align:middle line:84%
They just tell you you have
some redundant degrees freedom.

00:21:48.838 --> 00:21:49.930 align:middle line:90%
We just get rid of them.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.290 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out that
they actually-- yeah.

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:53.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:57.900 align:middle line:84%
So this is part of
the mystery, OK?

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.280 align:middle line:90%
This is part of the mystery--

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:05.350 align:middle line:84%
why, somehow, the gauge symmetry
leads to the interactions.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:08.310 align:middle line:90%
So Yeah yeah.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:09.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's a long story.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Let me just briefly make
some comments here, OK?

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:19.890 align:middle line:84%
So now, we more
or less understand

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:24.050 align:middle line:90%
that all these interactions--

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:27.440 align:middle line:84%
essentially, all these
important interactions

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.080 align:middle line:84%
in nature, those
fundamental interactions--

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:35.030 align:middle line:84%
they're all governed by
some massless particle, OK?

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:37.640 align:middle line:84%
They're all governed by
some massless particle.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:42.480 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, a
massless particle--

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.980 align:middle line:84%
you actually require to
have some kind of redundancy

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:50.520 align:middle line:84%
so that you can describe them
in a Lorentz covariant way.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Without those redundancy,
you cannot describe them

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:55.270 align:middle line:90%
in the Lorentz covariant way.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:58.060 align:middle line:84%
So in the sense, that's
where that comes from.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:58.620 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:59.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but you make the
statement which I just said.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Precisely, it's
actually a long story.

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.490 align:middle line:90%
Do you have any questions?

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:09.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:11.492 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Would it have
been possible to quantize

00:23:11.492 --> 00:23:13.914 align:middle line:84%
the Maxwell theory just using
the E field and the B field

00:23:13.914 --> 00:23:19.650 align:middle line:84%
without involving
any kind of gauge?

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.770 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: We don't know how to--

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:24.720 align:middle line:90%
so we don't know how to--

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:30.360 align:middle line:84%
there's no good way to quantize
that to give you a nice quantum

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:30.960 align:middle line:90%
theory.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And we also know that
physically, A mu actually plays

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:37.470 align:middle line:90%
a role.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:41.555 align:middle line:84%
And in situations like
a Aharonov--Bohm effect,

00:23:41.555 --> 00:23:42.930 align:middle line:84%
the A mu plays an
important role,

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.790 align:middle line:90%
even when E and B is equal to 0.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:49.890 align:middle line:84%
So A mu is a more fundamental
object than E and B.

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So E and B should be considered
as a derived object from A mu.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:59.950 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:00.670 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:01.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.877 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So here it was quite
natural to extend to fermions

00:24:04.877 --> 00:24:08.782 align:middle line:84%
to just have to identify--
the symmetry is already there.

00:24:08.782 --> 00:24:10.510 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have to
engineer it, I guess.

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:11.135 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:24:11.135 --> 00:24:13.880 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: But is there
a situation where

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.600 align:middle line:84%
extending this symmetry
to another field

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.141 align:middle line:84%
causes an issue when you're
trying to fix your gauge like

00:24:20.141 --> 00:24:21.780 align:middle line:90%
you had before--

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:24.550 align:middle line:84%
increase your
redundancy, I guess,

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:28.550 align:middle line:84%
when you're making
the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:30.740 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: I'm not sure I
understand your question.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.010 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So here
we had the issue

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:36.262 align:middle line:90%
in gauge fixing was from--

00:24:36.262 --> 00:24:36.970 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: No, no.

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:38.800 align:middle line:84%
We're not doing any
gauge fixing here.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:44.470 align:middle line:84%
We just have a more
generalized gauge symmetry.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:46.320 align:middle line:84%
We're not doing
any gauge fixing.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.195 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: No, no, no.

00:24:47.195 --> 00:24:50.588 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, so that came out
of the local gauge symmetry

00:24:50.588 --> 00:24:52.040 align:middle line:90%
of our A mu's.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.515 align:middle line:84%
But I'm saying when you extend
that to the psi, for example--

00:24:55.515 --> 00:24:56.140 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.740 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: --you get
any other issues

00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.910 align:middle line:90%
like we had from earlier or no?

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:01.770 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: What do you
mean by other issues?

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:04.365 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So issues when
you're fixing your gauge.

00:25:04.365 --> 00:25:05.948 align:middle line:84%
Or is that just a
step that we already

00:25:05.948 --> 00:25:07.160 align:middle line:84%
did before that we don't
have to worry about?

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.930 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:09.900 align:middle line:90%
You mean when we--

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:10.940 align:middle line:90%
no, no.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:14.450 align:middle line:84%
That won't change much
because we did before

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:16.080 align:middle line:90%
for the gauge fixing already.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:16.670 align:middle line:90%
It's enough.

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:17.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:18.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:21.210 align:middle line:90%


00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:22.580 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:26.100 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's talk
about the other example.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:34.130 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a scalar
field which is charged--

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:36.660 align:middle line:90%
say, complex scalar field--

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:43.730 align:middle line:84%
you can also couple
it to the photon, OK?

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:47.150 align:middle line:84%
That's what we did
for the fermions, OK?

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:51.767 align:middle line:84%
So let's consider if you
have a complex scalar.

00:25:51.767 --> 00:25:53.350 align:middle line:84%
So consider you have
a complex scalar.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:26:03.310 align:middle line:90%


00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:03.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can also have
some interaction terms, OK?

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:14.080 align:middle line:84%
So let's imagine we have
some complex scalar.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
invariant under phi.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Again, there's a
global symmetry.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:22.710 align:middle line:90%
U1 global symmetry.

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:23.730 align:middle line:90%
Alpha equal to constant.

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:26.330 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:27.830 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And then we have a
conserved current here--

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.780 align:middle line:90%
J mu equal to minus i.

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.730 align:middle line:90%
So again, your Noether current.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:47.700 align:middle line:90%


00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:57.880 align:middle line:84%
So now, you can just try
to do the same trick, OK?

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.250 align:middle line:84%
So let's just
couple this theory,

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:03.100 align:middle line:84%
combine this theory
to the Maxwell theory,

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.470 align:middle line:90%
but identify that J with this J.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:10.210 align:middle line:84%
So naively-- so the
reason I say naively

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:14.450 align:middle line:84%
is because this procedure
in this case will not work.

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can consider
the scalar QED, say,

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:24.280 align:middle line:84%
with photon couple, and
again, with this minus 1/4

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.400 align:middle line:90%
F square term.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So let me just write
the simplified version--

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.990 align:middle line:90%
just write F square.

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And then you can add this
scalar Lagrangian, OK?

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And now, you add the
coupling E. And then

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:42.835 align:middle line:84%
you can put A mu equal to J mu,
but with J mu given by this.

00:27:42.835 --> 00:27:45.640 align:middle line:90%


00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.470 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:49.360 align:middle line:90%
We say A mu given by this, OK?

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:54.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is the natural thing to
do based on our fermion story.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:28:07.770 align:middle line:90%


00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:09.030 align:middle line:90%
But now, you can check.

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.060 align:middle line:90%


00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.440 align:middle line:90%
But now, you can easily check.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:19.230 align:middle line:90%


00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:19.730 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:21.752 align:middle line:84%
So I will not do the
exact check here.

00:28:21.752 --> 00:28:22.835 align:middle line:90%
You should check yourself.

00:28:22.835 --> 00:28:26.150 align:middle line:90%


00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:28.700 align:middle line:90%
So let me call this L prime, OK?

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.370 align:middle line:84%
L tilde because this
is our naive theory.

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:39.980 align:middle line:84%
You can check that this
L tilde QED, scalar QED,

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.570 align:middle line:90%
is not invariant--

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:45.480 align:middle line:90%


00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:52.160 align:middle line:90%
gauge invariant, OK?

00:28:52.160 --> 00:29:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Means that you cannot find
the transformation on phi, OK?

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.540 align:middle line:84%
That this whole thing
is gauge invariant.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.040 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.080 align:middle line:84%
This whole thing
is gauge invariant.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And so for example, so
it's not gauge invariant.

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:19.020 align:middle line:84%
When we can check explicitly, if
you just copy what we do here,

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:29.680 align:middle line:84%
this phi x given by
ie lambda x phi x--

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.780 align:middle line:90%
so this won't work, OK?

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:34.160 align:middle line:90%
So it's not invariant.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:37.297 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:29:37.297 --> 00:29:39.677 align:middle line:84%
Can you just leave phi
the same when you do--

00:29:39.677 --> 00:29:41.510 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: No, you cannot
leave phi the same.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:44.750 align:middle line:90%


00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's a
very good question.

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So you cannot
leave phi the same.

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:54.590 align:middle line:90%


00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:56.360 align:middle line:84%
So naively, you
can ask yourself--

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.550 align:middle line:84%
you say this is supposed
to be conserved.

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:01.505 align:middle line:84%
And we previously
said if we have

00:30:01.505 --> 00:30:05.100 align:middle line:84%
A mu to a conserved current,
this is gauge invariant.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:10.320 align:middle line:84%
But this is conserved only when
you use the equation of motion

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.060 align:middle line:90%
of this theory.

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.910 align:middle line:84%
But now, when you couple
these two to this theory,

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:17.610 align:middle line:84%
then the equation of
motion for phi changed.

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:20.940 align:middle line:90%
And then so yeah.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.770 align:middle line:90%
So it no longer works, OK?

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:26.040 align:middle line:90%
And so just naively, do this.

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Naively, this is not
guaranteed to work.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.810 align:middle line:84%
It turns out in
the fermion case,

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:34.592 align:middle line:84%
it just worked because of the
existence of this symmetry,

00:30:34.592 --> 00:30:36.300 align:middle line:84%
because of the existence
of the symmetry.

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:38.920 align:middle line:90%


00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.860 align:middle line:90%
And it turns out, this theory--

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:45.050 align:middle line:84%
so now, this theory will
not be gauge invariant.

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:48.090 align:middle line:90%
And now, this would be bad, OK?

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:51.210 align:middle line:84%
It will be bad because
you can no longer

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:53.670 align:middle line:90%
find any local symmetry.

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:57.480 align:middle line:90%
This theory is invariant, OK?

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is one where the
generalization does not work.

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:02.850 align:middle line:90%
You cannot find anything.

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:04.830 align:middle line:90%
You can also not find others.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:08.760 align:middle line:84%
But this is bad because we
said we need gauge symmetry

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:12.150 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of unphysical
degrees freedom in A mu

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:14.370 align:middle line:84%
because A mu should only
have two polarizations,

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:15.210 align:middle line:90%
not to have four.

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:16.950 align:middle line:84%
So we need those
gauge symmetries

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:20.100 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of the unphysical
degrees freedom in A mu.

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.410 align:middle line:84%
But if this gauge symmetry
is broken by coupling

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:26.590 align:middle line:84%
to the scalar field, then this
theory cannot be consistent,

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:27.090 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:29.850 align:middle line:90%
So this theory is bad.

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:31.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.460 align:middle line:90%
This theory is bad.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out, we can just
generalize this principle, OK?

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:42.850 align:middle line:84%
We say let's just impose
gauge symmetry, OK?

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:46.020 align:middle line:84%
We can just impose
gauge symmetry.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.300 align:middle line:90%
So the way out--

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.025 align:middle line:84%
we can just impose
the gauge symmetry.

00:31:50.025 --> 00:31:52.920 align:middle line:90%


00:31:52.920 --> 00:32:09.320 align:middle line:84%
Impose the theory to be
invariant under this A mu,

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:13.370 align:middle line:84%
goes to A mu plus
partial mu lambda.

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And the phi goes to exponential
minus ie lambda x phi, OK?

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:28.830 align:middle line:84%
So we require this
to be under that, OK?

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:33.870 align:middle line:84%
So to write the theory
invariant under this,

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:38.870 align:middle line:84%
we can just easily borrow the
inside we already obtained

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.940 align:middle line:90%
from the fermionic case.

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:43.380 align:middle line:84%
But in the fermionic
case, we were

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:48.330 align:middle line:84%
told that this derivative,
this capital D,

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:52.690 align:middle line:84%
actually transforms nicely
under such transformation.

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:54.085 align:middle line:84%
When we make such
transformation,

00:32:54.085 --> 00:32:56.210 align:middle line:84%
whether psi is a fermion
or boson, and whether it's

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:59.610 align:middle line:84%
a scalar or spinor does
not play any role, OK?

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:02.040 align:middle line:84%
So we can now just
introduce D phi.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:06.290 align:middle line:90%


00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:12.430 align:middle line:84%
We can just introduce D
phi equal to partial mu phi

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:15.430 align:middle line:90%
minus ie A mu phi, OK?

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:18.340 align:middle line:84%
We can similarly
introduce D phi like this.

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And now, D phi then
transforms nicely

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:23.860 align:middle line:84%
under this kind of
transformation, OK?

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:34.855 align:middle line:90%
So D phi-- to mu phi, OK?

00:33:34.855 --> 00:33:36.700 align:middle line:90%
They transform nicely.

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And since this
transforms nicely,

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.780 align:middle line:84%
then we can easily write
down the Lagrangian, OK?

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So the L scalar QED
then can be written

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:50.370 align:middle line:90%
as just minus 1/4 F squared.

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And now, instead of the
standard derivative,

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:59.360 align:middle line:90%
I use this derivative.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:03.850 align:middle line:84%
I use this capital
D derivative, OK?

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And then I have m
square phi star.

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I can have
phi phi star, OK?

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And so this will be
invariant because those

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:16.300 align:middle line:84%
don't matter because those
don't involve derivatives, OK?

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:20.710 align:middle line:90%
And so yeah.

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:24.011 align:middle line:90%
So this is now gauge invariant.

00:34:24.011 --> 00:34:32.670 align:middle line:90%


00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:33.270 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:40.440 align:middle line:84%
So this D mu is called
covariant derivative, OK?

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Becaues it transforms
nicely under this gauge

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:46.179 align:middle line:90%
transformation.

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:48.108 align:middle line:84%
So it's called
covariant derivative.

00:34:48.108 --> 00:34:56.590 align:middle line:90%


00:34:56.590 --> 00:35:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So this capital D mu also
has a very deep connection

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:04.530 align:middle line:90%
to mathematics.

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
related to a subject,

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.300 align:middle line:90%
say, in differential geometry--

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:14.910 align:middle line:84%
a deep connection to
differential geometry,

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:18.030 align:middle line:84%
to a thing in
differential geometry

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:20.580 align:middle line:90%
called the connection, OK?

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:21.660 align:middle line:90%
Called the connection.

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:22.530 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, sorry.

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:24.428 align:middle line:90%
We're not going into that.

00:35:24.428 --> 00:35:24.928 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:24.928 --> 00:35:29.380 align:middle line:90%


00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:36.520 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's compare this
theory with that naive theory.

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:43.750 align:middle line:84%
So you can check
that L SQED is almost

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:51.310 align:middle line:84%
that L tilde SQED except
this has one more term.

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:57.520 align:middle line:84%
So the difference with
the fermion case--

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.680 align:middle line:84%
the fermion only has
one derivative, OK?

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And this one does not
have a derivative, OK?

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And here you have
two derivatives.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And each derivative gives
you additional A mu, OK?

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:18.770 align:middle line:84%
So when you expand this, so
here there are four terms, OK?

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:20.280 align:middle line:90%
There are four terms.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And three terms are
encoded in here, OK?

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Three terms are encoded
in here and in here.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.780 align:middle line:90%
But there's one more term, OK?

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:31.550 align:middle line:84%
It turns out this
leaves one more term.

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:37.810 align:middle line:90%


00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:40.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:45.780 align:middle line:84%
So actually, there's a quartic
inaction between A mu and phi,

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:46.280 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.590 align:middle line:84%
So this only introduces
cubic interaction.

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:51.787 align:middle line:84%
So if you just have
this J mu A mu,

00:36:51.787 --> 00:36:53.120 align:middle line:90%
you only have cubic interaction.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:58.040 align:middle line:84%
You only have 2 phi and 1 A. But
here because of this structure,

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.825 align:middle line:90%
you actually have 2 A.

00:36:59.825 --> 00:37:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Also, a term with
2A and 2 phi, OK?

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:06.730 align:middle line:90%


00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And when you add this term, then
the whole thing is nice, OK?

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:15.620 align:middle line:90%


00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:16.120 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.980 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:19.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:21.626 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Can I also
add higher order terms

00:37:21.626 --> 00:37:25.643 align:middle line:84%
like these quartic terms
into the fermionic theory?

00:37:25.643 --> 00:37:26.310 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry.

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Say it again.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.690 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Can I also add quartic
terms or some higher order

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:33.895 align:middle line:84%
terms into the QED
-- fermionic theory?

00:37:33.895 --> 00:37:34.770 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: No, no, no.

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:39.420 align:middle line:84%
You cannot add this term because
this term by itself is not

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.070 align:middle line:90%
gauge invariant.

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Fermionic term is already
gauge invariant by itself--

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:46.580 align:middle line:84%
because there's no
derivative here.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:50.430 align:middle line:90%
And so the structure is simpler.

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.875 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So I guess to
add to that question,

00:37:52.875 --> 00:37:55.180 align:middle line:84%
can you carefully engineer
higher order terms such that

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:55.680 align:middle line:90%
they're--

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.555 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:56.555 --> 00:37:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can engineer more
complicated terms, but not

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:00.930 align:middle line:90%
this kind of term.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:01.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:03.655 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: This is required for--

00:38:03.655 --> 00:38:04.530 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:06.562 align:middle line:84%
This is required for
gauge invariance.

00:38:06.562 --> 00:38:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:09.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:11.560 align:middle line:84%
For both fermion
and the scalar case,

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.830 align:middle line:84%
you can write down
more complicated terms

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:16.330 align:middle line:90%
which are gauge invariant.

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And the one we wrote down so
far is just the simplest one.

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:23.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:24.010 align:middle line:90%
Simplest ones.

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:24.775 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:38:24.775 --> 00:38:27.150 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So which one should
of these should I interpret

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:28.180 align:middle line:90%
as the electric current?

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:32.650 align:middle line:84%
J mu there or I guess J mu
plus the A mu psi psi psi?

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:33.850 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:39.160 align:middle line:84%
So still, so when you
interpret the electric current,

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:40.070 align:middle line:90%
it's still this J mu.

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:40.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:47.700 align:middle line:90%


00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.190 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:52.130 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:56.110 align:middle line:84%
So now, so let me
just make a comment.

00:38:56.110 --> 00:39:04.795 align:middle line:84%
So in this story, now the global
charge before now becomes the--

00:39:04.795 --> 00:39:06.670 align:middle line:84%
just to emphasize again--
in the scalar case,

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:10.370 align:middle line:84%
again, the global charge
for this global current

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:13.180 align:middle line:84%
has now become the
electric charge

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:16.270 align:middle line:84%
coupled to the electro-
magnetic fields, OK?

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Become electric charge coupled
to electro- magnetic field, OK?

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:21.900 align:middle line:90%


00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:22.630 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:26.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's draw the
Feynman rules, OK?

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:29.535 align:middle line:84%
So from here we can just
talk about the Feynman rules.

00:39:29.535 --> 00:39:39.830 align:middle line:90%


00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:43.210 align:middle line:84%
So let's first do
the fermionic case.

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:45.680 align:middle line:84%
So the rules for fermions
is the same as before.

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.054 align:middle line:84%
The only thing we just
need to write down--

00:39:48.054 --> 00:39:56.960 align:middle line:84%
the propagators are the same
as previously for the Maxwell

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:57.460 align:middle line:90%
theory.

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:00.070 align:middle line:90%


00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:02.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let's first do the QED.

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And the propagator
for A mu and phi--

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.730 align:middle line:90%
it's the same as before, OK?

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:16.320 align:middle line:84%
Because the
propagator only cares

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.580 align:middle line:90%
about the quadratic theory.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.560 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't care
about interactions.

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:23.100 align:middle line:90%
Same as before.

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:28.160 align:middle line:84%
So we can draw a wavy line
corresponding to A mu, OK?

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And then the solid line
corresponding to, say, psi, OK?

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:35.960 align:middle line:90%
Solid line equals 1 and 2 psi.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.630 align:middle line:84%
So this is related
to A mu propagator.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:42.920 align:middle line:84%
This is related to
psi propagator, OK?

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And now, the interaction
between them--

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:49.850 align:middle line:84%
this interaction between
them is given by this term.

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And then these
have the structure.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.440 align:middle line:90%


00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.780 align:middle line:90%
You have one fermion come in.

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:00.750 align:middle line:84%
You have two fermions and
then coupled to a photon, OK?

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So this is the same, very
similar to this Yukawa

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:04.560 align:middle line:90%
coupling.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.300 align:middle line:90%
We can that before--

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.850 align:middle line:84%
just now, this one
becomes a photon, OK?

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:10.920 align:middle line:90%
This one becomes a photon.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And this effective
vertex is given

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:19.610 align:middle line:90%
by minus ie A mu gamma mu, OK?

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:26.020 align:middle line:84%
So the minus comes
from minus here.

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:28.540 align:middle line:84%
The i comes from the
i in the action, OK?

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:30.160 align:middle line:84%
When you do the
passing equal action.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.810 align:middle line:90%
And you have minus ie.

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And then phi, psi, and A mu are
taken care of by those lines.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And then you only
have a gamma mu, OK?

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:43.780 align:middle line:84%
So the vertex here
is the gamma mu.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:44.830 align:middle line:90%
But pay attention.

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:48.140 align:middle line:84%
This gamma mu is actually a
matrix in the spinor space.

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to be careful
when you contract to the spinor

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:54.850 align:middle line:84%
indices because now,
these have spinor indices.

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:58.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's a matrix, OK?

00:41:58.220 --> 00:41:58.720 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:04.300 align:middle line:90%
So this is for the fermion.

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:05.640 align:middle line:90%
And oh, yeah.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:09.250 align:middle line:90%
So I should also mention--

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:21.980 align:middle line:84%
for the external legs, so
this is for the vertices

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:23.120 align:middle line:90%
and the propagator.

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.750 align:middle line:90%


00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And if we consider the
scattering amplitude--

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:36.450 align:middle line:90%


00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:39.470 align:middle line:84%
so for scattering amplitude,
we mentioned it before.

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:44.190 align:middle line:84%
For fermion, we need to include
the polarization vector.

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, for the
photon, we also

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:54.180 align:middle line:84%
need to include the polarization
vector for the external legs,

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:54.680 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:42:54.680 --> 00:43:01.140 align:middle line:84%
So for external legs, for
scattering amplitude--

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:11.020 align:middle line:90%


00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:14.560 align:middle line:84%
yeah, if you calculate the green
function, it doesn't matter.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.870 align:middle line:84%
You just include the
external propagator.

00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:18.940 align:middle line:84%
But for the
scattering amplitude,

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:22.720 align:middle line:84%
then we need to include
the polarization vector

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:23.900 align:middle line:90%
for photons.

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:29.170 align:middle line:84%
So for the initial state,
supposing the initial state,

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:33.100 align:middle line:84%
we have, say, some
vector k and alpha.

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:36.560 align:middle line:84%
So alpha gives its
polarization vector.

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.410 align:middle line:90%
And k is the momentum.

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:41.450 align:middle line:90%
And then we can denote it as--

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:46.070 align:middle line:84%
so alpha denotes the
polarization for the--

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:47.870 align:middle line:90%
and then say we can have k.

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:50.490 align:middle line:90%
So this is the momentum index.

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:52.760 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
momentum arrow, OK?

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And so this [INAUDIBLE]
corresponding to--

00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:59.660 align:middle line:90%


00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:00.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:01.610 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And so this is for
the initial state.

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Then for the final state,
if you have a photon

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:14.530 align:middle line:90%
in the final state, like this--

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:18.850 align:middle line:84%
and then again, we
just have an alpha.

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And so normally, we throw the
momentum arrow to come out

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.330 align:middle line:90%
if you have a final state.

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And then the polarization vector
will be just this star, OK?

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:32.720 align:middle line:90%
Just the complex conjugate.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.720 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's very easy.

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:34.220 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:37.410 align:middle line:90%


00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:38.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.500 align:middle line:84%
So when you write
down the amplitude,

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.810 align:middle line:90%
you just have to be careful.

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:45.390 align:middle line:84%
For external photon
legs, you have

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:48.970 align:middle line:84%
to include the
polarization vector.

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:51.060 align:middle line:84%
So for scalar QED,
it's very similar.

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:59.390 align:middle line:90%


00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:05.480 align:middle line:84%
So here we can
introduce a dashed line

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:09.510 align:middle line:84%
that's corresponding
to a scalar propagator.

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:10.010 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So corresponding to the
scalar propagator, OK?

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And now, this arrow
now has a meaning

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:20.330 align:middle line:84%
because the scalar
has a charge, OK?

00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:21.990 align:middle line:90%
A scalar has a charge.

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And so this arrow is
not the momentum arrow

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:26.490 align:middle line:90%
you can do arbitrarily.

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:31.140 align:middle line:90%
And so there are various--

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:35.130 align:middle line:90%
and yeah.

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And so for QED, let's
look at the interaction

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:40.950 align:middle line:90%
with the photon.

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:44.550 align:middle line:90%
And then we have this vertex.

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And we also have this vertex
with J mu coupled to that, OK?

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:56.530 align:middle line:84%
So then that kind of interaction
will have the following form.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:59.220 align:middle line:90%
So this J mu coupling is easy.

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:03.360 align:middle line:84%
We can schematically
write it down.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:08.745 align:middle line:84%
So again, you have 2 phi and
then coupled to a photon, OK?

00:46:08.745 --> 00:46:11.460 align:middle line:90%


00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:14.410 align:middle line:90%
Coupled to a photon, OK?

00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:19.840 align:middle line:90%
And so A mu will have index.

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And so we can put
the mu here, OK?

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And this vertex is given by
minus i e k plus k prime mu,

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:33.560 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:35.710 align:middle line:90%
Suppose the momentum here is k.

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And the momentum
here is k prime, OK?

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:42.640 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, the reason you
have this k plus k prime mu

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:48.990 align:middle line:84%
is because here there's a
derivative acting on phi.

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And so this derivative acting
on this phi gives you a k1, a k.

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And this derivative on phi
gives you the k prime, OK?

00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And you have the sum
of these two terms.

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:04.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you have this kind
of term for the interaction.

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:04.943 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:47:04.943 --> 00:47:05.610 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:08.325 align:middle line:84%
Going back to the fermion
QED for a second--

00:47:08.325 --> 00:47:08.950 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:12.640 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Do you still also
have, for the external legs,

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.600 align:middle line:90%
for fermions that are usually--

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.100 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, the
same [AUDIO OUT]

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:16.460 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:17.085 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:47:17.085 --> 00:47:20.748 align:middle line:84%
So fermion-- external legs,
exactly the same as before.

00:47:20.748 --> 00:47:21.290 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:21.915 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:47:21.915 --> 00:47:23.090 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:25.950 align:middle line:84%
So we only need to introduce
new rules for photons.

00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:29.600 align:middle line:90%


00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:30.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:33.320 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Still follow the same
rules for starting from one--

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.460 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:36.050 align:middle line:90%
That rule is exactly the same.

00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:37.280 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: If you got a
[INAUDIBLE] interaction,

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:38.450 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] in the right order?

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:39.020 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: That's right.

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:39.500 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And now, you have
to just be careful.

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Some of the vertices are
now including matrices.

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:47.205 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:47.205 --> 00:47:47.705 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:47:47.705 --> 00:47:49.588 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Doesn't
photon polarization

00:47:49.588 --> 00:47:51.912 align:middle line:84%
have to transverse
the momentum--

00:47:51.912 --> 00:47:52.495 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Hmm?

00:47:52.495 --> 00:47:53.953 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Isn't
photon polarization

00:47:53.953 --> 00:47:55.575 align:middle line:90%
have to transverse the momentum?

00:47:55.575 --> 00:47:56.700 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:57.090 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:57.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:47:57.590 --> 00:47:59.010 align:middle line:90%
For the physical photon, yeah.

00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:03.585 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but for the physical
photon, indeed, yeah.

00:48:03.585 --> 00:48:06.548 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Also,
why is it complex?

00:48:06.548 --> 00:48:07.090 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Oh.

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:08.960 align:middle line:90%
You can choose it to be complex.

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:14.440 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you
choose a spherically--

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:17.050 align:middle line:84%
polarization, then
it's a complex vector.

00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:18.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:20.620 align:middle line:84%
For the one we wrote
down, it's real.

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:22.360 align:middle line:84%
But then this
complex is the same.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:23.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.300 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
this, but when

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:28.030 align:middle line:84%
you have an internal
photon like in a diagram,

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:32.877 align:middle line:84%
do you sum over all four
polarizations or just two?

00:48:32.877 --> 00:48:34.460 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Internal
photon-- you always

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:38.440 align:middle line:90%
just use the photon propagator.

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And the photon propagator
will include everything.

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:42.297 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:42.297 --> 00:48:43.130 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:45.517 align:middle line:90%


00:48:45.517 --> 00:48:46.600 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Other questions?

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:50.080 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: For external
vertices having matrices-- now,

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:52.570 align:middle line:84%
that's just a byproduct of the
number of degrees of freedom

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:54.290 align:middle line:90%
you have per particle?

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:55.070 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:56.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.515 align:middle line:90%
You mean the gamma mu?

00:48:57.515 --> 00:48:58.140 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:58.140 --> 00:48:58.765 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:48:58.765 --> 00:49:02.610 align:middle line:84%
It's just because of
spinor nature, right?

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:03.940 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:08.100 align:middle line:84%
So this vertex-- so A mu
J mu gave you this vertex,

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:10.620 align:middle line:90%
but we also have this vertex.

00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:13.590 align:middle line:90%
And this vertex is easy.

00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:20.920 align:middle line:84%
We essentially just have
two fermions or two scalars,

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:26.590 align:middle line:84%
but this one with
two photons, OK?

00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:28.190 align:middle line:90%
With two photons.

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And so these have A
mu A mu contracted.

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:38.500 align:middle line:84%
So if we write mu
here and nu here,

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:47.610 align:middle line:84%
then we will have minus
ie squared eta mu nu, OK?

00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:53.670 align:middle line:90%


00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:54.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:55.790 align:middle line:90%
Minus ie squared.

00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:56.720 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.160 align:middle line:84%
So minus i for the
same reason, and the e

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.540 align:middle line:90%
squared for the same reason.

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And this A mu contracted, so
you have eta mu nu there, OK?

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:06.380 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:10.700 align:middle line:90%


00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And depending on
what is V here, phi

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.300 align:middle line:84%
may have some
additional interaction.

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:22.890 align:middle line:90%
But suppose V is given by phi 4.

00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:23.390 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Suppose V, say, is equal to
lambda 4 and phi phi star

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.770 align:middle line:90%
squared, OK?

00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And then you will also have
interactions like these--

00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:47.030 align:middle line:90%
four scalar interactions.

00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:50.760 align:middle line:90%


00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:51.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:53.172 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:53.172 --> 00:50:54.630 align:middle line:84%
You have two come
in, two come out.

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:55.130 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:58.050 align:middle line:90%


00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And this would be just
minus i lambda, OK?

00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.520 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Could you clarify--
the vertex with two scalars

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:08.592 align:middle line:90%
and one photon comes from?

00:51:08.592 --> 00:51:09.175 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Hmm?

00:51:09.175 --> 00:51:11.330 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Can you
explain where the V

00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:13.270 align:middle line:90%
is a vertex with two scalars?

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:14.260 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Oh, right.

00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:14.760 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:17.865 align:middle line:90%
It comes from this term.

00:51:17.865 --> 00:51:20.620 align:middle line:90%
It comes from this term.

00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is A mu times J.
And the J has two phis here.

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:28.078 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:51:28.078 --> 00:51:29.286 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Right, right, yeah.

00:51:29.286 --> 00:51:35.240 align:middle line:90%


00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.200 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:39.640 align:middle line:90%


00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:40.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:42.730 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Would it be possible
just to hypothetically,

00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:45.070 align:middle line:84%
if I wanted to, give
the photon mass?

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:47.000 align:middle line:84%
I'd just add a mass
term to the Lagrangian?

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.205 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:51:48.205 --> 00:51:50.540 align:middle line:90%


00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:51.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.760 align:middle line:90%
What's the question?

00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:53.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:54.130 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible to
add a mass term

00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:58.420 align:middle line:84%
for the photon in
the Lagrangian?

00:51:58.420 --> 00:51:59.992 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: No, you cannot.

00:51:59.992 --> 00:52:01.825 align:middle line:84%
No because that violates
the gauge symmetry.

00:52:01.825 --> 00:52:02.170 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:52:02.170 --> 00:52:02.810 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:03.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:03.310 --> 00:52:07.970 align:middle line:84%
So the gauge symmetry is what
ensures the photon is massless.

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that's why
this is something

00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:12.250 align:middle line:90%
we don't want to break.

00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:14.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:15.533 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:52:15.533 --> 00:52:16.200 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.492 align:middle line:90%
This might be a silly question.

00:52:17.492 --> 00:52:22.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you have the scalar
QED and then the fermion QED,

00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:22.925 align:middle line:90%
can you add them?

00:52:22.925 --> 00:52:23.550 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:24.280 align:middle line:90%
You can add them.

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:27.370 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So then it's the
one theory and [INAUDIBLE]??

00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:28.110 align:middle line:90%
It's combined?

00:52:28.110 --> 00:52:28.360 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:29.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:33.400 align:middle line:84%
You can combine them just
like you have a theory--

00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:35.800 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic
field coupled both to

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:38.850 align:middle line:84%
charged scalar and
the charged fermions.

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can
certainly combine them.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:41.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:45.815 align:middle line:84%
The reason I'm separating
them is just for convenience.

00:52:45.815 --> 00:52:47.440 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So can we
have an interaction

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:50.750 align:middle line:84%
term directly between the
fermion term and the scalar

00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:51.250 align:middle line:90%
term?

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:52.042 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Oh, yeah.

00:52:52.042 --> 00:52:53.770 align:middle line:90%
You can add whatever.

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:57.910 align:middle line:84%
You only have to make sure
things are gauge invariant.

00:52:57.910 --> 00:53:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And you can add arbitrary
interactions you want.

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Just, you have to
make sure they're

00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:05.680 align:middle line:84%
invariant under those
gauge transformations.

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:07.140 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So on
the other question,

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:14.520 align:middle line:84%
can we make another theory
that has U1 gauge theory,

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:20.240 align:middle line:90%
but with massive particles?

00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:21.650 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: With
massive particles?

00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:22.550 align:middle line:90%
Massive photons?

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:24.230 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: With the photons.

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:28.080 align:middle line:84%
We have something
that is massive

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:32.550 align:middle line:90%
and coupled to the [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:33.330 align:middle line:90%
Can we do that?

00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:33.630 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: No.

00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:34.110 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:34.610 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:53:34.610 --> 00:53:39.450 align:middle line:84%
You're asking whether the
massive photon coupled

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:42.060 align:middle line:90%
to fermionic field exists?

00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:43.050 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:43.890 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: OK.

00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:44.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So this question can be
answered in several--

00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:55.070 align:middle line:84%
so if you just directly
add a mass term--

00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:59.110 align:middle line:84%
so let's add a mass
term for the photon.

00:53:59.110 --> 00:54:01.840 align:middle line:90%


00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:02.890 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:54:02.890 --> 00:54:06.220 align:middle line:90%
So you can immediately check.

00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:07.910 align:middle line:90%
This is not gauge invariant.

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:10.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's the reason we didn't
add such a term to the Maxwell

00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:13.900 align:middle line:84%
theory because in the Maxwell
theory, if you add this term,

00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:15.760 align:middle line:84%
it will violate
the gauge symmetry.

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:17.120 align:middle line:90%
The same reason here.

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:20.620 align:middle line:84%
So you cannot add
such a term, OK?

00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:23.710 align:middle line:90%
So you cannot add such a term.

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:26.170 align:middle line:90%
So this is ruled out, OK?

00:54:26.170 --> 00:54:29.070 align:middle line:90%
You cannot add this.

00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:32.580 align:middle line:84%
But now, you say is
it possible somehow,

00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:38.080 align:middle line:84%
through some other way, that the
photon actually gains mass, OK?

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:40.450 align:middle line:90%
That's possible.

00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:41.920 align:middle line:84%
That's called the
Higgs mechanism.

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.680 align:middle line:84%
That's how Higgs
got a Nobel Prize.

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:47.510 align:middle line:90%
And that comes from this term.

00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:51.930 align:middle line:84%
So now, you imagine
somehow, this phi now

00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:54.680 align:middle line:90%
has a vacuum expectation value.

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And now, phi has
a constant part.

00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:02.970 align:middle line:84%
If phi has a constant path,
then this becomes a mass term

00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:04.320 align:middle line:90%
for the photon, OK?

00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:06.688 align:middle line:84%
And then the photon
becomes massive.

00:55:06.688 --> 00:55:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And actually, that's
precisely what's

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:10.810 align:middle line:84%
happening inside
the superconductor.

00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:14.760 align:middle line:84%
So in every superconductor,
something like this happens.

00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:15.330 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And the photon inside the
superconductor is massive, OK?

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:27.190 align:middle line:84%
That's what responsible for this
London effect, Meisner effect,

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:28.680 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, OK?

00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And in the
superconductor, that's

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:35.190 align:middle line:90%
understood by Phillip Anderson.

00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:40.020 align:middle line:84%
He was a little bit
unhappy because he

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:43.860 align:middle line:84%
thought he should have
claimed for the Higgs effect

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.900 align:middle line:84%
because he understood
it earlier.

00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:47.280 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:50.040 align:middle line:84%
But he did understand
the mechanism earlier.

00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:50.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:53.340 align:middle line:84%
But Higgs got the
Nobel Prize because he

00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:54.990 align:middle line:90%
predicted the particle.

00:55:54.990 --> 00:56:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, that's a long story
I'm not going to go into.

00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:00.737 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:00.737 --> 00:56:02.070 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Just a quick question.

00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:05.910 align:middle line:84%
For the photon propagator,
do we give the same factor?

00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't think we
said in the previous lecture

00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:13.433 align:middle line:84%
that we give the same factor
as for the scalar field.

00:56:13.433 --> 00:56:14.100 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry.

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:14.580 align:middle line:90%
Say it again.

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:15.990 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: For
photon propagator--

00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.615 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:56:16.615 --> 00:56:18.480 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: --which
factor do we give?

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.500 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Which factor?

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:21.660 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:23.400 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: You mean--

00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:24.935 align:middle line:84%
we just use the
photon propagator.

00:56:24.935 --> 00:56:25.560 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:28.422 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't think we
did it in this lecture.

00:56:28.422 --> 00:56:29.130 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: We did.

00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:29.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, at the end
of last lecture.

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:32.353 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let me just write it down.

00:56:32.353 --> 00:56:42.090 align:middle line:84%
So the photon propagator
depends on this parameter xi.

00:56:42.090 --> 00:56:46.470 align:middle line:84%
For xi equal to 1, the
photon propagator--

00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:48.630 align:middle line:90%
if I call it D mu nu, yeah.

00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, let me
just write it down.

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:54.015 align:middle line:84%
For xi equal to 1, this
is just given by eta mu nu

00:56:54.015 --> 00:56:56.530 align:middle line:90%
k squared minus i epsilon.

00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:59.310 align:middle line:90%
So this is for xi equal to 1.

00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:02.760 align:middle line:84%
So for xi not equal
to 1, so yeah.

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:04.800 align:middle line:90%
So this is for xi equal to 1.

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:06.390 align:middle line:84%
For xi not equal
to 1, then there

00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:09.530 align:middle line:90%
are some additional terms.

00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:10.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:12.398 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I might be leaving
the scope of this class,

00:57:12.398 --> 00:57:14.905 align:middle line:84%
but the weak force has a
carrier that has mass, right?

00:57:14.905 --> 00:57:15.530 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:17.030 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: And it's
called a fermion.

00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.710 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Right.

00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:19.885 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So that is
possible to construct.

00:57:19.885 --> 00:57:21.010 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:21.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Again, this mechanism
is what's responsible

00:57:24.450 --> 00:57:26.903 align:middle line:84%
for the weak interaction
in short ranged.

00:57:26.903 --> 00:57:27.570 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:29.365 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: So the
weak interaction

00:57:29.365 --> 00:57:31.212 align:middle line:90%
started as massless particle--

00:57:31.212 --> 00:57:31.920 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Got it.

00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:34.320 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: --but then
through the Higgs mechanism

00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and then the analog of A mu
for the weak interaction,

00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:40.950 align:middle line:84%
becomes massive, and then
becomes short ranged.

00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:41.410 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Got it.

00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:41.630 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:42.780 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:43.890 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, yeah.

00:57:43.890 --> 00:57:45.190 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.690 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:57:45.690 --> 00:57:46.860 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:47.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:50.580 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: In the standard model
is the Higgs the only scalar

00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:54.080 align:middle line:84%
that couples to the
photon [INAUDIBLE]??

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:58.430 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: So in
the standard model,

00:57:58.430 --> 00:58:00.864 align:middle line:90%
Higgs is the only scalar field.

00:58:00.864 --> 00:58:01.364 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:01.364 --> 00:58:06.780 align:middle line:90%


00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:10.410 align:middle line:84%
But you can have some other
composite scalars, like pions.

00:58:10.410 --> 00:58:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Fundamental scalars--
it's just the Higgs field.

00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:17.550 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:22.380 align:middle line:84%
So this concludes the
discussion of the QED.

00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And now, ready just to study the
physical processes in QED, OK?

00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And before doing that,
we need to develop

00:58:31.170 --> 00:58:35.340 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of
formalism because when

00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:36.870 align:middle line:84%
we talk about
physical process, then

00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:38.910 align:middle line:90%
we need to make connection.

00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:39.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:41.430 align:middle line:90%
QED is real life, OK?

00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And then we can make connection
with the real experiments.

00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:46.887 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:58:46.887 --> 00:58:48.720 align:middle line:84%
To make connection with
the real experiment,

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:51.930 align:middle line:84%
we need to develop
one more thing.

00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:55.240 align:middle line:84%
We need to develop
one more thing.

00:58:55.240 --> 00:59:01.080 align:middle line:84%
So we need to learn
how to calculate

00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:03.130 align:middle line:90%
the cross-section, OK?

00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:23.250 align:middle line:90%


00:59:23.250 --> 00:59:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how to
calculate the cross-section.

00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:33.030 align:middle line:90%
So this is a digression, OK?

00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:37.860 align:middle line:84%
So first, let's
remind you how we

00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:41.820 align:middle line:84%
define a cross-section in
nonrelativistic quantum

00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:42.630 align:middle line:90%
mechanics, OK?

00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:45.180 align:middle line:84%
In the scattering theory
of nonrelativistic quantum

00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:46.020 align:middle line:90%
mechanics.

00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:53.740 align:middle line:84%
So in nonrelativistic
quantum mechanics,

00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:57.220 align:middle line:90%
you consider there is a target.

00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:59.860 align:middle line:84%
The target is normally
considered to be a point, OK?

00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Here I just make it big
so that we can see it.

01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:08.210 align:middle line:90%
So here is the target.

01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:11.170 align:middle line:90%
And then we define our axis--

01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:14.750 align:middle line:84%
the scattering axis, which
the particle come in.

01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:17.425 align:middle line:84%
So this is some incident
beam of particle.

01:00:17.425 --> 01:00:24.960 align:middle line:90%


01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.650 align:middle line:90%
OK, coming into this direction.

01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:29.940 align:middle line:84%
So say this is a
Z-direction, OK?

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And moving in this
direction to--

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and then it will interact
with this particle.

01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:39.690 align:middle line:90%
And then it will scatter, OK?

01:00:39.690 --> 01:00:41.250 align:middle line:90%
So the particle will scatter.

01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And then we put the detector
around this target particle

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:51.190 align:middle line:84%
to detect the
scattered particle.

01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.690 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:53.520 align:middle line:90%
So for example, yeah.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:59.440 align:middle line:84%
So you should view
this solid angle here.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:00:59.940 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
the phi direction.

01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
theta direction, OK?

01:01:06.850 --> 01:01:13.410 align:middle line:90%
So here is the theta direction.

01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is some small solid
angle, which the detector--

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:22.850 align:middle line:84%
suppose there's a
detector here, OK?

01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:25.800 align:middle line:90%


01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.570 align:middle line:90%
Suppose there's a detector here.

01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And then this detector spread
the solid angle, D omega,

01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:35.910 align:middle line:90%
with respect to the target, OK?

01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:41.490 align:middle line:84%
So this is the standard
setup for nonrelativistic--

01:01:41.490 --> 01:01:45.540 align:middle line:84%
scattering process in the
nonrelativistic quantum

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:47.940 align:middle line:90%
mechanics.

01:01:47.940 --> 01:02:04.630 align:middle line:84%
So what we measure is dN
dt outgoing particle, OK?

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:08.920 align:middle line:84%
Scattered particle in the
theta and phi direction, OK?

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.750 align:middle line:90%
So this is theta and phi.

01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:14.770 align:middle line:84%
This is where the detector
locates in the theta phi

01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:16.210 align:middle line:90%
direction.

01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:19.620 align:middle line:90%
So this is the number.

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:24.740 align:middle line:84%
So this dN dt is the
number of particles--

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:36.850 align:middle line:84%
number of scattered particles,
number of scattered particles

01:02:36.850 --> 01:02:37.510 align:middle line:90%
in --

01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:45.945 align:middle line:90%
per unit time in the detector.

01:02:45.945 --> 01:02:49.430 align:middle line:90%


01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:52.880 align:middle line:84%
It means registered by
the detector, detected

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:58.910 align:middle line:84%
by the detector at the
location theta phi, OK?

01:02:58.910 --> 01:03:02.585 align:middle line:90%


01:03:02.585 --> 01:03:03.085 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:03:03.085 --> 01:03:06.650 align:middle line:90%


01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:12.618 align:middle line:84%
So the quantity we
measure is this quantity.

01:03:12.618 --> 01:03:13.910 align:middle line:90%
We just put the detector there.

01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:17.270 align:middle line:90%
We just measure particles, OK?

01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, so this scene
depends on many things, OK?

01:03:22.810 --> 01:03:24.400 align:middle line:84%
This quantity depends
on many things,

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:30.980 align:middle line:84%
depends on the interaction
between the incident particle

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:32.900 align:middle line:90%
and the target, et cetera.

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:36.710 align:middle line:84%
But they also depend on many
other kinematic factors, OK?

01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:43.630 align:middle line:84%
So for example, it will
depend on -- this out--

01:03:43.630 --> 01:03:48.940 align:middle line:84%
clearly, it will depend on the
number of incident particles.

01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:53.480 align:middle line:90%


01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:53.980 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So this is the number
of incident particles

01:03:55.810 --> 01:03:56.605 align:middle line:90%
per unit time.

01:03:56.605 --> 01:04:08.820 align:middle line:90%


01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:11.020 align:middle line:84%
If you have more incident
particles, of course,

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:14.850 align:middle line:84%
you will detect more
outgoing particles, OK?

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this will also
be proportional to D omega,

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:23.800 align:middle line:84%
the solid angle extended
by the detector.

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.810 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a larger
detector, of course,

01:04:25.810 --> 01:04:28.260 align:middle line:84%
you will detect
more particles, OK?

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:34.250 align:middle line:90%


01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And then if we divide it by
those obvious kinematic factors

01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:44.930 align:middle line:84%
away, then we will
get something more

01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:48.050 align:middle line:84%
intrinsic to the
interactions, OK?

01:04:48.050 --> 01:05:11.450 align:middle line:90%
So we can consider--

01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:14.170 align:middle line:90%


01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:16.404 align:middle line:84%
we can divide by D omega
and divide it by this thing.

01:05:16.404 --> 01:05:21.640 align:middle line:90%
So this object, dN dt.

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Then we divide it by D
omega per solid angle out

01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:29.830 align:middle line:84%
and divide it by
the incident number

01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:32.750 align:middle line:90%
of particles per unit time.

01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So this should give
us the probability

01:05:44.810 --> 01:06:00.860 align:middle line:84%
of a particle to be scattered
to theta phi direction, OK?

01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:05.900 align:middle line:84%
So this is the quantity
which captures the effect

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:07.760 align:middle line:90%
of the interaction, OK?

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So this is a more
intrinsic quantity.

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:14.100 align:middle line:90%


01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:16.290 align:middle line:84%
But experimentally,
this is actually

01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:21.470 align:middle line:84%
not the thing we directly
measure in the experiment

01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:22.940 align:middle line:84%
because in the
experiment, it's not

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:26.240 align:middle line:84%
easy to count the number of
the incident particles, OK?

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:30.600 align:middle line:84%
We always consider
a beam of particles.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:33.810 align:middle line:84%
We always consider a
large number of particles,

01:06:33.810 --> 01:06:36.760 align:middle line:90%
a beam of particles.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:41.460 align:middle line:84%
So experimentally,
it's more convenient.

01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:49.400 align:middle line:90%


01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:52.150 align:middle line:90%
We often use the incident flux.

01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:57.580 align:middle line:90%


01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:09.740 align:middle line:84%
It's the number of particles
per unit time and per unit area,

01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:10.340 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:11.810 align:middle line:90%
So we just send the beam.

01:07:11.810 --> 01:07:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And we just need to know
the density of the beam, OK?

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:18.980 align:middle line:84%
So that will give us
the flux, the number

01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:22.350 align:middle line:84%
of particles ingoing per
unit time and per unit area.

01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:28.470 align:middle line:84%
So A is the cross-section
of the incident beam, OK?

01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:30.290 align:middle line:90%
So now, this is the quantity.

01:07:30.290 --> 01:07:32.320 align:middle line:90%
And now, we have to divide--

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:35.140 align:middle line:84%
so instead of dividing by this
one, we divide by this one.

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:35.640 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:46.790 align:middle line:84%
So now, this D sigma D omega,
which is defined to be dN

01:07:46.790 --> 01:07:51.790 align:middle line:90%
dt D omega out--

01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and then you divide it
by incident flux, OK?

01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:58.890 align:middle line:90%


01:07:58.890 --> 01:08:02.860 align:middle line:90%
Incident flux per unit time, OK?

01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:08.310 align:middle line:84%
So that's the object we
actually measure, OK?

01:08:08.310 --> 01:08:14.590 align:middle line:90%
So some comments on this.

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:18.269 align:middle line:84%
So the first comment is that
this has dimension of area.

01:08:18.269 --> 01:08:26.890 align:middle line:90%


01:08:26.890 --> 01:08:30.250 align:middle line:84%
So because this thing
is dimensionless--

01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:32.800 align:middle line:84%
this thing is dimensionless
because T canceled,

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:35.109 align:middle line:90%
but now, we have divided by dA.

01:08:35.109 --> 01:08:36.649 align:middle line:90%
So A is going up.

01:08:36.649 --> 01:08:38.649 align:middle line:84%
And then this has
dimension of area.

01:08:38.649 --> 01:08:41.899 align:middle line:90%


01:08:41.899 --> 01:08:45.470 align:middle line:84%
So the physical
meaning of this, which

01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:50.029 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you learned in
your nonrelativistic quantum

01:08:50.029 --> 01:09:00.250 align:middle line:84%
mechanics class, is that this
gives you the physical meaning

01:09:00.250 --> 01:09:02.750 align:middle line:90%
of this object.

01:09:02.750 --> 01:09:18.279 align:middle line:84%
So this gives you the effective
area of interaction, OK?

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:20.939 align:middle line:90%


01:09:20.939 --> 01:09:27.010 align:middle line:84%
So heuristically, you can
imagine the following.

01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:30.942 align:middle line:84%
So if you imagine the
incident particle,

01:09:30.942 --> 01:09:33.359 align:middle line:84%
this target particle-- they
actually have some short range

01:09:33.359 --> 01:09:34.710 align:middle line:90%
interaction, OK?

01:09:34.710 --> 01:09:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And then they no
longer interact, say,

01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:40.770 align:middle line:90%
outside some distance.

01:09:40.770 --> 01:09:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And then heuristically,
then this quantity then

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:51.810 align:middle line:84%
can be considered as-- give
you the area of interaction

01:09:51.810 --> 01:09:56.770 align:middle line:90%
around this target particle, OK?

01:09:56.770 --> 01:09:58.330 align:middle line:90%
Around the target particle.

01:09:58.330 --> 01:10:03.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's why this D
sigma D omega is called

01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.780 align:middle line:90%
the differential cross-section.

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:14.420 align:middle line:90%


01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So the area which is going into
the direction of theta phi--

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:23.120 align:middle line:84%
and the sigma total,
which is defined

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:27.510 align:middle line:84%
to be D sigma, D omega-- you
integrate them over all angles,

01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:28.010 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:30.530 align:middle line:84%
So this is a function
of theta and phi.

01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And now, you integrate
over all solid angles.

01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And then that gives you
the total cross-section.

01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:44.060 align:middle line:90%


01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:44.600 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And to see this effective
area of interaction,

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:56.100 align:middle line:84%
can be seen in the very
simple classical example.

01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:58.350 align:middle line:84%
So this definition actually
is not quantum mechanical.

01:10:58.350 --> 01:11:00.000 align:middle line:84%
You can also do it
classically, OK?

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not restricted
to quantum mechanics.

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:06.160 align:middle line:84%
This can be defined for
any scattering event,

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.970 align:middle line:84%
including in
classical mechanics.

01:11:08.970 --> 01:11:20.130 align:middle line:90%


01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:29.570 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you
have classical scattering,

01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:38.970 align:middle line:84%
say, of some bullets,
off a billiard ball,

01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:42.330 align:middle line:84%
and then you find
the sigma total--

01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:45.960 align:middle line:84%
so suppose you have
classical scattering, OK?

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you find
the sigma total.

01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:50.460 align:middle line:90%
It's just the cross-section.

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:56.130 align:middle line:84%
It's just the total
area, total surface area.

01:11:56.130 --> 01:11:56.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:11:56.670 --> 01:11:57.360 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:05.180 align:middle line:84%
It's the cross-section area
over the billiards, OK?

01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:11.910 align:middle line:90%


01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:14.982 align:middle line:84%
Because classically, when
you hit the billiard ball,

01:12:14.982 --> 01:12:16.440 align:middle line:84%
then you hit the
billiard ball, OK?

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.240 align:middle line:84%
If you don't hit
the billiard ball,

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.280 align:middle line:90%
then you don't change direction.

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And then the total
cross-section just

01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:27.180 align:middle line:84%
is the cross-section of
the billiard ball, OK?

01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And so when you go
to quantum theory,

01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:35.940 align:middle line:84%
then this is the heuristic
way you understand

01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:40.830 align:middle line:84%
there's some kind of effective
cross-section for this target,

01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:41.430 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And outside that area
then you no longer have--

01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:47.610 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Heuristically, you no
longer have interactions.

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:51.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:56.610 align:middle line:84%
So now, let me just
make two quick remarks

01:12:56.610 --> 01:12:58.065 align:middle line:90%
in a relativistic theory.

01:12:58.065 --> 01:13:02.850 align:middle line:90%


01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:05.590 align:middle line:90%
So now, we can generalize.

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:10.550 align:middle line:84%
So this discussion is in
the nonrelativistic context.

01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:12.940 align:middle line:84%
So in the relativistic
context, we essentially just

01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:20.630 align:middle line:84%
have D sigma cross-section from
initial state to final state,

01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:21.130 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:23.620 align:middle line:84%
We no longer have-- so
this is very specific.

01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:27.000 align:middle line:84%
We have one particle
scattering the other particle.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And this particle
scatters away, OK?

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:33.870 align:middle line:84%
But in relativistic, you
can have two particles.

01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:36.840 align:middle line:84%
You can create
10,000 particles, OK?

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And so this language
no longer works, OK?

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:43.230 align:middle line:84%
So but still, you can define
some kind of cross-section

01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:47.890 align:middle line:84%
of initial state alpha to
some final state beta, OK?

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And so we will be interested
in the situation in which we

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:55.030 align:middle line:90%
have two initial particles, OK?

01:13:55.030 --> 01:14:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Because experimentally,
it's convenient just

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.040 align:middle line:84%
to have two
particles scattering.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.660 align:middle line:84%
So you have two
initial particles.

01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:13.390 align:middle line:84%
But final state, in principle,
can be arbitrary, OK?

01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:18.960 align:middle line:90%
And so this object--

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:20.890 align:middle line:84%
since, in the
relativistic theory,

01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:27.212 align:middle line:84%
this should be physically
observable, so this should be--

01:14:27.212 --> 01:14:29.670 align:middle line:84%
so because this essentially is
a measure of the probability

01:14:29.670 --> 01:14:32.930 align:middle line:84%
of the scattering,
so we require this

01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:38.961 align:middle line:90%
object to be Lorentz invariant.

01:14:38.961 --> 01:14:46.040 align:middle line:90%


01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:47.450 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And also, in the relativistic,
we just scatter two particles.

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:54.500 align:middle line:84%
There's no notion of
what is the target

01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:56.990 align:middle line:84%
or what is the
incident particle.

01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:59.240 align:middle line:84%
So these two particles
should have equal rho.

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:08.040 align:middle line:84%
So this should be
symmetric in 1 2, OK?

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:10.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you exchange 1
2, this cross-section

01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:12.020 align:middle line:90%
should be the same.

01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:12.520 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:15.470 align:middle line:90%
It should be the same.

01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:18.820 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you consider--
but you can always

01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:22.180 align:middle line:84%
consider in the rest frame,
say, of particle 2, OK?

01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:27.265 align:middle line:84%
So suppose we consider
the rest frame.

01:15:27.265 --> 01:15:30.390 align:middle line:90%


01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Suppose we go into the
rest frame of particle 2.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And then we roughly
have this situation, OK?

01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:41.630 align:middle line:90%
So this is particle 2.

01:15:41.630 --> 01:15:44.820 align:middle line:84%
This is the particle 1,
which comes to particle 2.

01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And then in this situation, we
can define the alpha to beta

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:56.350 align:middle line:84%
based on our nonrelativistic
considerations.

01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:58.450 align:middle line:90%
And then we consider--

01:15:58.450 --> 01:16:07.990 align:middle line:84%
so here I use the probability
from alpha to beta dP, OK?

01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:12.970 align:middle line:84%
So this essentially
replaces that.

01:16:12.970 --> 01:16:13.600 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Here the final particle
only has one particle.

01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:19.490 align:middle line:90%
So you can define a solid angle.

01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:24.370 align:middle line:84%
But if we have 10,000 particles
here in the beta, of course,

01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:25.960 align:middle line:84%
I cannot define a
solid angle, OK?

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:30.370 align:middle line:84%
So I can just talk about
probability from alpha to beta,

01:16:30.370 --> 01:16:31.720 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.390 align:middle line:84%
From alpha to beta,
but per unit time.

01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And then again, we divide it
by the incident flux of 1.

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:43.550 align:middle line:90%


01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:44.690 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:16:44.690 --> 01:16:47.940 align:middle line:90%
The incident flux of 1, OK?

01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:48.510 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

01:16:48.510 --> 01:16:51.710 align:middle line:90%
And let me just call it in.

01:16:51.710 --> 01:16:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And 1 means the number
of particles of 1, OK?

01:16:56.690 --> 01:16:59.390 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

01:16:59.390 --> 01:17:04.160 align:middle line:84%
So what we will do
is that we will first

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:08.540 align:middle line:84%
calculate this object
in the rest frame of 2.

01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we construct the
Lorentz invariant version

01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:15.140 align:middle line:90%
of this, OK?

01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:19.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's our strategy
to define what

01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:21.540 align:middle line:84%
will be the relativistic
generalization of this.

01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:22.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:25.960 align:middle line:84%
So we will discuss
this next time.

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:30.000 align:middle line:90%
