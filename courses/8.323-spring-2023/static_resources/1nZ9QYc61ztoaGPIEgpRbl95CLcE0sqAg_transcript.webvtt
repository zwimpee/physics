[CLICKING]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.770 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: OK, so let us start.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.420 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So last time, at the
end of the lecture,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:27.680 align:middle line:84%
we discussed relativistic
generalization

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.685 align:middle line:90%
of the cross section.

00:00:28.685 --> 00:00:32.340 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.580 align:middle line:84%
So we want to derive a
relativistic generalization

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.030 align:middle line:84%
of the cross section
from some initial state

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.590 align:middle line:90%
to some final state.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.330 align:middle line:84%
So initial state is denoted by
alpha, the final state denoted

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.260 align:middle line:90%
by beta.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.410 align:middle line:84%
So we will, for most
physical process, we

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.960 align:middle line:84%
will consider the two
particles scattering.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.300 align:middle line:90%
So this is just two particles.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.680 align:middle line:90%
And they scatter.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is our initial state,
always only have two particles.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:84%
But the final state can have
arbitrary number of particles.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.180 align:middle line:84%
You can have an arbitrary
number of particles.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And then we define, so we
require that d sigma alpha beta

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.770 align:middle line:90%
to be Lorentz invariant.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.586 align:middle line:90%


00:01:31.586 --> 00:01:36.050 align:middle line:84%
But because the
probability for--

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.630 align:middle line:84%
that should not depend
on say, your frame.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:46.010 align:middle line:84%
We also want to define to
be symmetric in 1 to 2.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:59.560 align:middle line:84%
So to make a connection with
the nonrelativistic story,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:07.290 align:middle line:84%
we can consider the
rest frame, say--

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.970 align:middle line:84%
say as a starting
point, we can consider

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.250 align:middle line:90%
the rest frame of particle 2.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.120 align:middle line:84%
You can always go to the
rest frame of particle 2.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And then in that frame, then
we can define this quantity

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:31.540 align:middle line:84%
to be the probability per unit
time from alpha to beta dt,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.890 align:middle line:84%
and then divided by the
incident flux of particle 1.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:49.570 align:middle line:90%


00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:57.550 align:middle line:84%
So this is the p alpha
beta t is the probability--

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.530 align:middle line:90%
let me just write it.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:14.390 align:middle line:84%
So this is the probability
per unit time for this process

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.510 align:middle line:90%
from alpha to beta.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And then, the dN1/dt dA
would be the incident flux

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.740 align:middle line:90%
of particle 1.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.850 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So this expression is a
natural generalization

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.860 align:middle line:84%
to relativistic context, which
in the rest frame of particle

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.580 align:middle line:84%
2, in the rest
frame of particle 2.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And so, our strategy
is to first work out

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.410 align:middle line:84%
this quantity in
the rest frame of 2.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And then, we use the Lorentz,
the requirement of the Lorentz

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.540 align:middle line:84%
invariant and the
symmetric in 1 and 2

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.030 align:middle line:84%
to write it in
the general frame.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.990 align:middle line:90%
So that's our strategy.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.230 align:middle line:90%


00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And so first, let's talk about
this quantity, this probability

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.230 align:middle line:90%
from alpha to beta.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So we have the probability
from alpha to beta.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.770 align:middle line:90%


00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So by definition, it's
defined as the following.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.480 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.160 align:middle line:84%
So we want to look at the
transition amplitude, which

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.260 align:middle line:84%
gives you the beta state at time
plus infinity and from alpha

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.390 align:middle line:90%
at time minus infinity.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.860 align:middle line:90%
So this is the amplitude.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.320 align:middle line:90%
And then we take the square.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And then we divide by the
normalization over the beta

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.490 align:middle line:90%
itself under the alpha itself.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.260 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.580 align:middle line:84%
We divided by the normalization
of the beta and alpha,

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.870 align:middle line:90%
the state themselves.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.870 align:middle line:84%
So that is the whole thing,
really defined the probability.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So the upstairs, we
already defined before.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So previously, we
defined the beta plus,

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.800 align:middle line:90%
infinity alpha minus infinity.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.150 align:middle line:84%
So this is by our previous
definition is given by 2 pi

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:50.530 align:middle line:84%
to the power 4 delta,
p alpha p beta.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So the p alpha p beta
is the total momentum

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.740 align:middle line:90%
of the initial and final state.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:01.730 align:middle line:90%
And times M alpha beta.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.770 align:middle line:84%
M alpha beta is defined
to be the scattering

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:12.130 align:middle line:84%
amplitude from alpha to beta,
So this was essentially,

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.515 align:middle line:84%
our definition of the
scattering amplitude.

00:06:15.515 --> 00:06:16.015 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:06:16.015 --> 00:06:18.910 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: T minus-- so the
plus infinity, minus infinity,

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.610 align:middle line:84%
is that in space
time or just time?

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.690 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Time, yeah.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.280 align:middle line:84%
it means that the T
equal to minus infinity.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.040 align:middle line:90%
So this is the Heisenberg state.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.200 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
Heisenberg picture.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.890 align:middle line:84%
So this means that at t
equal to minus infinity,

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.490 align:middle line:84%
we have a free particle
state described by alpha.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And the t equal
to plus infinity,

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:47.790 align:middle line:84%
we have free particle
state, given by beta.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.860 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.240 align:middle line:90%
So now, let's take the square.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.200 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.080 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's take the square.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:06.950 align:middle line:84%
So remember, so the reason
we need to put in downstairs,

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.350 align:middle line:84%
you say, why do we need
to put the downstairs?

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Because are they supposed
to be normalized?

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.450 align:middle line:84%
But in practice when
we do the calculation,

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:21.080 align:middle line:84%
or in practice when we talk
about the free particles,

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.660 align:middle line:90%
we use the plane wave basis.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.990 align:middle line:84%
But plane wave, remember,
is not normalizable.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.620 align:middle line:84%
It's only normalizable
as a delta function.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So the normalization is
not equal to 1, exactly.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.080 align:middle line:90%
So we have to be careful.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we need
to include them here.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.700 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.200 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.890 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's look at
this quantity squared.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.630 align:middle line:90%
So let's just move it down.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So to save time, I
just want to copy it.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:00.470 align:middle line:84%
So this quantity squared then
just equal to the right hand

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:01.550 align:middle line:90%
side square.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:08.020 align:middle line:84%
So we have 2 pi 4 the
delta function square.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And then we have M
alpha beta squared.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.840 align:middle line:90%


00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And now, let's look at
the delta function square.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.110 align:middle line:84%
So the delta function
squared will have two pieces.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:25.470 align:middle line:90%


00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:26.790 align:middle line:90%
So the delta function square--

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:32.500 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.669 align:middle line:90%
let me just save time.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:40.120 align:middle line:84%
So this square, then we can
take one piece, one copy of it.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.000 align:middle line:84%
We just write it as
p alpha minus p beta.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And then the other piece
will be just delta 4,

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.070 align:middle line:90%
we can just evaluate at the 0.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Because we already
set the p alpha equal

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.240 align:middle line:84%
to beta from the
first delta function.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.370 align:middle line:84%
So the second factor can
be just become delta 0.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.020 align:middle line:90%
So now we know how to--

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.670 align:middle line:90%
so we have seen this before.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.440 align:middle line:90%
So what is this object?

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember?

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:15.853 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:09:15.853 --> 00:09:17.020 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Space time volume.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.590 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, it's the
total space time volume.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:25.960 align:middle line:84%
The reason is that
the 2 pi delta 4 0.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is the 0
in momentum space.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:35.650 align:middle line:84%
So this is just equal to d4x
exponential ikx evaluated

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:39.910 align:middle line:84%
at the k equal to 0,
evaluated at the k equal to 0.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Because this is giving
you 2 two pi delta k.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:43.780 align:middle line:90%
And so you evaluate at k = 0.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.830 align:middle line:84%
When you evaluate the
k = 0, then of course,

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:48.970 align:middle line:84%
this is just the
space time volume.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So I take the
spatial volume to V.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:54.505 align:middle line:84%
And then this T,
is the time period.

00:09:54.505 --> 00:09:59.050 align:middle line:90%


00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So physically, you
can interpret the T

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:09.300 align:middle line:84%
as the duration at
the time duration

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.040 align:middle line:84%
we actually doing
the experiment.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Because only that part is
relevant for our experiment.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.320 align:middle line:84%
So this capital T
can be interpreted --

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.660 align:middle line:90%


00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.630 align:middle line:90%
OK, good?

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And now, we can
just replace here,

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:37.410 align:middle line:84%
so now we can just replace
here by V times T. We can just

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:48.860 align:middle line:84%
replace here, V times T. So now
let's look at the downstairs.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.870 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's look at downstairs.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:55.970 align:middle line:84%
The downstairs, so the alpha
and the beta will be just say--

00:10:55.970 --> 00:11:01.870 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so the typical
alpha, so the alpha state

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:08.333 align:middle line:84%
would be say, if your initial
momentum is P1 and P2,

00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:09.250 align:middle line:90%
it would be like this.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:13.660 align:middle line:84%
For scalar particle, it just
will be specified by P1 and P2.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you have
polarizations, then there

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.710 align:middle line:90%
will be polarizations.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Here, I'll just
give you an example.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.420 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you look
at the normalization

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:27.940 align:middle line:84%
of this kind of states, remember
the P1 and P2 are defined.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.740 align:middle line:84%
So remember, if you
have a single particle

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:34.210 align:middle line:90%
state of momentum p.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:47.800 align:middle line:84%
So that is normalized to be 2
pi cubed 2p0 delta 3 p minus

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.925 align:middle line:84%
p-prime, because
they're always on-shell.

00:11:50.925 --> 00:11:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Initial and final
state, they on-shell.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:56.780 align:middle line:90%
So p0 are functions of p.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:01.050 align:middle line:90%
So that's how we normalize them.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:04.460 align:middle line:84%
So p is normalized
by square root

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:11.570 align:middle line:84%
omega k omega p,
say ap acting on 0.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And for example, for
scalar particle, and then

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.965 align:middle line:84%
you look at the
normalization just like this.

00:12:15.965 --> 00:12:19.470 align:middle line:90%


00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:26.550 align:middle line:84%
So now if you look
at the p with itself,

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.430 align:middle line:84%
then you have p
equal to p-prime.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
essentially, you just

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:84%
have 2p0 times V. The V
is the spatial volume.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.680 align:middle line:84%
Because here you just have
2 pi cubed the delta 0.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And delta 0 is in
the spatial momentum.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And spatial momentum
for the same reason,

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.290 align:middle line:84%
just gave you the
spatial volume.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:54.300 align:middle line:90%


00:12:54.300 --> 00:13:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And so now, we can just apply
these two to alpha and beta.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:06.180 align:middle line:84%
So the alpha, So if I take
the alpha to have momentum P1,

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:10.620 align:middle line:84%
P2, you can see this particle
of momentum p1 and p2

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:17.490 align:middle line:84%
on beta, to consist of
momentum say, k1 and kn.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Suppose there are n particles,
so n can be arbitrary integers.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And then from here, then
the alpha with itself,

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:38.420 align:middle line:84%
would be just 2 E1 times the
volume and 2 E2 times volume.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.270 align:middle line:84%
E1 and E2 are the energy
over the p1 and p2.

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:45.490 align:middle line:90%


00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So E1 is equal to P
1,0 and equal to P 2,0.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:14:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, the beta would
be to take the product j from 1

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:23.810 align:middle line:84%
to n, 2kj, 0'th
component times V.

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And so example,
just kj0 just equal

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:36.565 align:middle line:90%
to kj squared plus mj squared.

00:14:36.565 --> 00:14:39.270 align:middle line:90%


00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.180 align:middle line:84%
So here, we allow the
different particles

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:50.370 align:middle line:84%
to have different mass and
similarly with p 1,0 and p2.

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:58.050 align:middle line:84%
OK so now with
those preparations,

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:03.210 align:middle line:90%
now we can write down dpt.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:10.740 align:middle line:84%
So now, the dp alpha to
beta dt then essentially

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:15.180 align:middle line:84%
just equal to p alpha
beta divided by t,

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:20.170 align:middle line:84%
the total duration of
the physical process.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And so, the reason
they just relate it.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.190 align:middle line:90%
You say, how can you do this?

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:27.510 align:middle line:90%
This is a differential.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And how can you just
divide it by the t?

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.405 align:middle line:84%
Do you know a reason why
we can just divide by this?

00:15:33.405 --> 00:15:43.110 align:middle line:90%


00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.280 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Well presumably,
it's the probability was small

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.450 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:51.210 align:middle line:84%
You would just expect it
to go up linearly in time.

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.940 align:middle line:90%


00:15:53.940 --> 00:16:01.110 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Just because of--
yeah, that's a good statement.

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:05.430 align:middle line:84%
But the statement,
I wanted you to say

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:10.060 align:middle line:84%
is that because the time
translation symmetry.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And so, you would expect that
the probability per unit time

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.880 align:middle line:90%
should be independent of time.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And so the probability,
say for duration of time,

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.060 align:middle line:84%
and you can just multiply
by the total time.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, in order to make
this equation make sense.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the p
has to be small.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, if
you multiply-- yeah,

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.463 align:middle line:90%
this thing has to be small.

00:16:31.463 --> 00:16:32.880 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, when
you multiply by T,

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:39.650 align:middle line:84%
of course it will be greater
than 1 But just to divide by T,

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.375 align:middle line:84%
it's from the time
translation symmetry.

00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:90%


00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:49.090 align:middle line:84%
So this is good because we know
here, from the delta function,

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:53.380 align:middle line:84%
there's a factor of T.
There's a factor of T.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:58.360 align:middle line:84%
So if we combine
everything together,

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.830 align:middle line:90%
and then we can just--

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:08.609 align:middle line:84%
then the upstairs is given
by, so we have the 2 pi power

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:18.760 align:middle line:84%
of 4 delta 4 p alpha p
beta, the m alpha to beta

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.540 align:middle line:90%
squared times VT.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:28.089 align:middle line:84%
And then divided by T,
and then this T go away,

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:33.100 align:middle line:90%
so I can just erase this T.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:38.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is the upstairs, and
then divided by T, a capital T.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And then the downstairs, we
just copy these two expression.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Downstairs, I just copy this
expression and this expression.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:18:01.030 align:middle line:84%
So this is 4 E1E2 times V
square and then k from 1

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:15.980 align:middle line:90%
to n 2kj0 times V. Yes?

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.350 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So now taking
T to be the total time

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.090 align:middle line:84%
of your experiment,
are you taking

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:22.700 align:middle line:84%
V to be the volume
of your experiment?

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.770 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.810 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Of your detector?

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:28.310 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: No, it's
not the detector.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:32.480 align:middle line:84%
It's just, we are
computing S matrix.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.210 align:middle line:84%
So x matrix, you always assume
you wait for a long time

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:37.670 align:middle line:84%
so that your initial
state is free,

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:39.730 align:middle line:90%
and your final state is free.

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:43.880 align:middle line:90%
So of course, it's much not.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:47.620 align:middle line:90%
It's the range of your detector.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.930 align:middle line:84%
You have to put the detector
very far away in order

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:51.400 align:middle line:90%
to measure the particle.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.770 align:middle line:90%


00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.750 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine the
V just essentially

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:07.610 align:middle line:84%
is the volume, which the
experiment is happening.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:08.570 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:11.490 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:15.270 align:middle line:84%
So, you see there's all
this V flying around.

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:18.300 align:middle line:90%
So they look very unpleasant.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.080 align:middle line:90%
But don't worry.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Later, if you are
doing the right thing,

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.080 align:middle line:84%
then all these unpleasant
things will go away.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.900 align:middle line:90%
So that's the rule of physics.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And in the
intermediate step, you

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.720 align:middle line:84%
may see a lot of
unpleasant things.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.020 align:middle line:84%
But if you are doing
the right thing

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.060 align:middle line:84%
and then all this unpleasant
thing will go away, or you say,

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.970 align:middle line:84%
well, then I must be
doing the right thing.

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.180 align:middle line:84%
So here, actually
this probability

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:47.250 align:middle line:84%
is not the probability
we actually measure.

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Because here, I assume
that the final state--

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.425 align:middle line:84%
here I'll assume
the final state--

00:19:53.425 --> 00:19:56.710 align:middle line:90%


00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:58.990 align:middle line:84%
yeah, here, I assume
the final states

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:03.520 align:middle line:90%
have precise momentum k1, kn.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.590 align:middle line:84%
So in reality, of
course, we will not

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:08.950 align:middle line:84%
be able to make the
precise measurements.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:24.910 align:middle line:84%
So in real experiment, detectors
have finite resolutions.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:32.720 align:middle line:90%


00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:38.680 align:middle line:84%
So what we measure is actually
when we say the particle say,

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:50.060 align:middle line:84%
have momentum k1, we actually
means that the particle 1,

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:58.460 align:middle line:90%
it's within some dk 1 around k1.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:02.660 align:middle line:84%
So there's always some
finite neighborhood of k1

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:08.600 align:middle line:84%
which are allowed by
our detector resolution.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, in
reality, it's particle 2

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:19.010 align:middle line:90%
in dk2 around k2, et cetera.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:25.610 align:middle line:84%
So the particle
n, dkn around kn.

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:28.820 align:middle line:84%
So then, we actually
need to integrate over

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:34.920 align:middle line:90%
all these resolutions.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:39.090 align:middle line:84%
So that means that we
should multiply dP/T.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:44.730 align:middle line:84%
This corresponding to
sharp final momentum,

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and we should multiply
by those uncertainties.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:56.880 align:middle line:84%
So that means that, so if I
take this equation to be star,

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.570 align:middle line:84%
this equation to be star,
so the one actually,

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:03.330 align:middle line:90%
is measured by the experiment.

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:08.400 align:middle line:84%
When we say P alpha beta dt,
from the real experiment,

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:13.400 align:middle line:84%
it's actually corresponding
to the star times--

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:17.620 align:middle line:90%


00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.760 align:middle line:90%
those uncertainties around the--

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:31.830 align:middle line:84%
so j equal to 1 to
n d3 kj 2 pi cubed.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.670 align:middle line:90%


00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:40.130 align:middle line:84%
So we need to multiply
the number of states

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:47.450 align:middle line:84%
within each dk
momentum space volume,

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:50.450 align:middle line:84%
So the number of the state,
and the number of states

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:53.045 align:middle line:84%
is given by this
times the volume.

00:22:53.045 --> 00:22:56.010 align:middle line:90%


00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:59.280 align:middle line:84%
So do you remember where
this volume come from?

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:03.540 align:middle line:90%


00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:05.610 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Density of states.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:06.510 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Exactly.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.350 align:middle line:84%
So this gives you the
density of states.

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:12.630 align:middle line:84%
It's because the-- so
if I just remind you--

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:16.410 align:middle line:84%
remember if you-- so the
way to think about it,

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:24.550 align:middle line:84%
just imagine you put
your system in the box,

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:31.600 align:middle line:84%
and then your energy level will
be quantized in terms of 2 pi,

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.860 align:middle line:84%
say 2 pi cubed
divided by the volume.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.710 align:middle line:84%
So this is the number
of states in momentum

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:40.690 align:middle line:90%
space, the density of states.

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you multiply
it by the dk.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:51.970 align:middle line:90%


00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:55.690 align:middle line:84%
So this is actually the
quantity we are interested in.

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:59.220 align:middle line:84%
This is the quantity
we're interested in.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.255 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:24:00.255 --> 00:24:03.810 align:middle line:90%


00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:12.350 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's just plug
that star into here.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:18.010 align:middle line:84%
So now, the nice thing, now
we can count the number of Vs.

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:22.840 align:middle line:84%
If we are doing the right
thing, all the V should cancel

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:29.290 align:middle line:90%
except yeah, but not quite yet.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:33.680 align:middle line:84%
So upstairs, we have one
V. Here we have V squared.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:37.250 align:middle line:84%
So let's first cancel
this V so that we

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:39.350 align:middle line:90%
don't have to worry about that.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:41.630 align:middle line:90%
So let's first cancel that V.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And now, we have downstairs,
we have V for each j.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And the upstairs, now we
multiply this by this.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And then for each j,
have one V. So all this V

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:58.310 align:middle line:84%
will cancel that V. All
this V will cancel that V.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:05.210 align:middle line:84%
So we're left with only this
single V, this single V.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.130 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can write
it as the following.

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:11.960 align:middle line:84%
So I can write it this
as M alpha beta squared.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.750 align:middle line:90%
So I just copy this.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.090 align:middle line:90%
And then I divide it by--

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:25.220 align:middle line:84%
let's keep this-- divided
by 4 E1E2 times V.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And then I group everything
else into what I call d mu.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.900 align:middle line:90%
And d mu is everything else.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.620 align:middle line:84%
D mu is defined to be
this delta function.

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:48.680 align:middle line:90%


00:25:48.680 --> 00:26:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, j from 1 to n,
d3 kj 2 pi cubed 2kj0.

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:05.900 align:middle line:84%
So I just combine
these two products,

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.040 align:middle line:90%
combine these two products.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:17.140 align:middle line:90%


00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:21.400 align:middle line:84%
So the nice thing,
the reason I group

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:28.310 align:middle line:84%
all this together because now
d mu now is Lorenz invariant.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:30.830 align:middle line:90%


00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:35.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is a Lorentz
invariant measure.

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Because you remember,
this Lorenz invariant.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And remember, this
combination is also

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Lorentz invariant from your
first day, essentially in QFT,

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:50.240 align:middle line:90%
in your first pset.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So now, this nice
thing is that this now

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:53.645 align:middle line:90%
is a Lorentz invariant.

00:26:53.645 --> 00:26:59.870 align:middle line:90%


00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:03.460 align:middle line:84%
So now, we have this
nice expression.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.130 align:middle line:90%
We have this nice expression.

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:09.960 align:middle line:84%
We have this, by definition,
is Lorentz invariant.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And then we have this 4 E1E2,
and times V, 4 E1 times V.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And now, we want to write them
into a Lorentz invariant way.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.320 align:middle line:90%
But we haven't done it.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.780 align:middle line:90%
This is only upstairs.

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.490 align:middle line:84%
This by itself, is
not Lorenz invariant.

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:31.100 align:middle line:84%
We have to divide it
by the downstairs.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:35.580 align:middle line:90%
So the downstairs is the flux.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.650 align:middle line:90%
It's the flux.

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:48.950 align:middle line:84%
So now, in the rest
frame of particle 2,

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:52.085 align:middle line:84%
so lets calculate the
flux of the particle.

00:27:52.085 --> 00:27:56.360 align:middle line:90%


00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.250 align:middle line:90%
So the flux of the particle--

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:02.170 align:middle line:90%


00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:04.860 align:middle line:84%
so we need to calculate
the flux of particle 1.

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:09.000 align:middle line:90%


00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's the thing
we need to divide.

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So this is the flux
of the particle 1.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So the flux is the number
of particle per unit time

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:27.540 align:middle line:84%
and per area, per
unit time, per area.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:32.040 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
same as the number

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:36.090 align:middle line:84%
of the particle, number
density of the particle 1 times

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:37.770 align:middle line:90%
the velocity of the particle 1.

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:43.020 align:middle line:90%


00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So remember, the
flux is essentially

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:49.150 align:middle line:90%
the density times the velocity.

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:53.450 align:middle line:84%
So this gives you the number
of particles per volume.

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is giving
you the distance

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.220 align:middle line:90%
traveled per unit time.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And so together,
they give you that.

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:05.530 align:middle line:90%


00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:13.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is the velocity, so this
is the density of particle 1.

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.690 align:middle line:84%
So this is all in the
rest frame of particle 2.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:23.630 align:middle line:90%


00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So now in this experiment, we
have two particle scattering.

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:31.570 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think
will be the density of 1.

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:33.490 align:middle line:90%
So what do you think is the n1?

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:40.020 align:middle line:90%


00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:40.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:41.820 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:42.570 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Exactly.

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:43.820 align:middle line:90%
How many particles do we have?

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:46.050 align:middle line:90%
We only have one particle.

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So this is just given as 1/V.
So this is just given by 1/V.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.730 align:middle line:90%
So now we can find the d sigma.

00:29:56.730 --> 00:30:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So the d sigma
alpha 2 beta, then

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:10.690 align:middle line:84%
is defined to be
dp/dt now divided

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:14.710 align:middle line:90%
by the flux of 1, particle 1.

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:17.830 align:middle line:90%
So now, this is just given by--

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.660 align:middle line:90%
now the volume cancel.

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:24.260 align:middle line:90%
Because n1 is 1 over volume.

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.020 align:middle line:90%
And then, there's a volume here.

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And now finally,
this volume cancel.

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:32.860 align:middle line:84%
So now, if we divide that by
the flux and the volume cancel,

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and then we get m alpha
beta squared d mu.

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And then divide it
by E1E2, and v1,

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:50.800 align:middle line:90%
the velocity of the particle 1.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.120 align:middle line:90%


00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.510 align:middle line:84%
So v1, of course, can
also be interpreted

00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:01.620 align:middle line:84%
as a relative velocity
between 1 and 2.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so this is the
expression we find.

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:09.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is the expression in
the rest frame of particle 2.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:13.160 align:middle line:90%


00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:23.250 align:middle line:84%
So by definition,
we want this thing

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:28.200 align:middle line:84%
to be Lorentz invariant and
the symmetric in 1 and 2.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:30.755 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I was
thinking like regarding

00:31:30.755 --> 00:31:33.900 align:middle line:84%
the cancellation of
the 1 over V factor,

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.000 align:middle line:84%
is another way to
interpret it like, you

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.820 align:middle line:84%
think of instead
of a plain wave,

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:42.053 align:middle line:84%
like a narrow wave packet
or something centered at k1.

00:31:42.053 --> 00:31:43.970 align:middle line:84%
So you would get like a
V from the wave packet

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:45.595 align:middle line:84%
sensitive states and
that would cancel.

00:31:45.595 --> 00:31:46.460 align:middle line:90%
Is that valid?

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:50.170 align:middle line:90%


00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:55.070 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, I think
it's the similar idea.

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:56.780 align:middle line:90%
Because let me see--

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:59.840 align:middle line:90%


00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.750 align:middle line:84%
yeah, because essentially,
you get rid of that V.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:07.160 align:middle line:84%
When you consider
the wave packet,

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:10.610 align:middle line:84%
then you get rid of this
V. And then, you also

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:13.640 align:middle line:84%
get rid of this
V. So you just get

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:18.860 align:middle line:84%
rid of the V one upstairs one
downstairs, yeah, that's right.

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:21.660 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.830 align:middle line:84%
So now, we want to write this
in the Lorentz invariant form.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:27.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is emphasized this
is in the rest frame of 2.

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:31.650 align:middle line:90%


00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:36.420 align:middle line:84%
So now, I look for
object, so now, I

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:47.100 align:middle line:84%
want to look for object,
which I will call it sigma.

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:51.370 align:middle line:90%
So sigma is Lorentz invariant.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:57.970 align:middle line:90%


00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And let me write here,
sigma is Lorentz invariant.

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:07.790 align:middle line:90%


00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And the symmetric in 1 and the
2 and in the rest frame of 2,

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.940 align:middle line:84%
then the sigma becomes
this downstairs,

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:33.410 align:middle line:90%
become this E1E2 times V1.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:37.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is not the manifest
Lorentz invariant object.

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:40.390 align:middle line:84%
It's also not
symmetric in 1 or 2.

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:42.940 align:middle line:84%
But that we should be
able to find the object

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:46.210 align:middle line:84%
sigma that by itself,
is a Lorentz invariant,

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:49.660 align:middle line:84%
symmetric in 1 and 2 and
in the rest frame of 2,

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:52.690 align:middle line:90%
reduced to this object.

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.340 align:middle line:84%
If I can find this
object, then I'm

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:57.690 align:middle line:84%
done in finding
the cross section.

00:33:57.690 --> 00:33:58.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:02.860 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Should there be a
factor of 4 in the denominator?

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.900 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: There should
be a factor of 4--

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.350 align:middle line:90%
yeah, there should be.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:12.969 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yes, some other questions?

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:13.810 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:18.250 align:middle line:84%
So I want to look for
this object sigma.

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:23.199 align:middle line:84%
And so you can do a
little bit trial and error

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:24.940 align:middle line:90%
to find such a sigma.

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.370 align:middle line:84%
So I will just write
down the answer for you.

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And to save you the trouble, I
could have put it in your pset,

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:36.909 align:middle line:90%
but I decided not to do it.

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:39.460 align:middle line:84%
So turned out the
sigma is given by--

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:42.949 align:middle line:84%
so when you write down the
answer, it's very simple.

00:34:42.949 --> 00:34:46.130 align:middle line:84%
You can almost
guess it in a sense.

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:54.969 align:middle line:84%
So P1 dot P2 squared minus
m1 squared times m2 squared.

00:34:54.969 --> 00:35:01.030 align:middle line:84%
m1 and m2 are the mass
of the particle 1 and 2.

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:05.900 align:middle line:84%
So this object satisfies
these three conditions,

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.210 align:middle line:84%
this object satisfies
these conditions.

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Also, I will leave the exercise
for yourself to check it.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.450 align:middle line:90%
It's very easy to check it.

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:14.750 align:middle line:84%
So you just go to
the rest frame of 2.

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And then you can check
if it's reduced to that.

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:20.620 align:middle line:90%


00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:25.260 align:middle line:84%
So now, we almost have our final
answer for the cross section

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:31.660 align:middle line:84%
so the d sigma for
these 2 to n scattering.

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:48.560 align:middle line:90%


00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:52.200 align:middle line:84%
So now, we just collect
our final result.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:56.810 align:middle line:84%
So we have the sigma
alpha beta now,

00:35:56.810 --> 00:36:04.540 align:middle line:84%
is equal to m alpha beta
squared, d mu divided

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:10.240 align:middle line:90%
by 4 sigma, just d mu.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.030 align:middle line:84%
So this is just
our final answer.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And the sigma is given by that
guy, a capital sigma just given

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:19.570 align:middle line:90%
by that guy.

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:23.020 align:middle line:90%


00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And so, this is manifested
in Lorenz invariant.

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And the manifest
symmetric on the 1 and 2,

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.965 align:middle line:84%
because sigma is obviously
symmetric on the 1 and 2.

00:36:32.965 --> 00:36:37.510 align:middle line:90%


00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
beautiful formula.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.720 align:middle line:84%
Even though we went
through a lot of trouble,

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:46.472 align:middle line:90%
went through a lot of Vs and Ts.

00:36:46.472 --> 00:36:48.430 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, we get
a very beautiful answer.

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:54.290 align:middle line:90%


00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:56.540 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's can see
some kinematic regimes

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:57.245 align:middle line:90%
of this formula.

00:36:57.245 --> 00:37:00.460 align:middle line:90%


00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:02.835 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's talk about some
kinematics of this formula.

00:37:02.835 --> 00:37:13.780 align:middle line:90%


00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:16.430 align:middle line:90%
So it's convenient.

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:18.760 align:middle line:84%
So we have two particles,
two initial particles.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:22.840 align:middle line:84%
It's convenient to introduce
the center of mass energy

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:26.890 align:middle line:90%
for the full system.

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:30.100 align:middle line:84%
So we can define something
called s, small s.

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:33.830 align:middle line:84%
This is not big S. So big
S is reserved for action.

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:37.600 align:middle line:84%
So this is small s
P1 plus P2 squared.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:43.180 align:middle line:90%


00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:48.190 align:middle line:84%
So P1 plus P2 is that
of the total momentum

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:49.390 align:middle line:90%
of the initial state.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's also the total
momentum of your final state,

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:55.450 align:middle line:84%
just from the
momentum conservation.

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And then if I look
at P1 and P2 squared,

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.380 align:middle line:84%
and then this is just
essentially the invariant mass

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:06.685 align:middle line:90%
for your full system.

00:38:06.685 --> 00:38:09.280 align:middle line:90%


00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.050 align:middle line:90%
So this s is--

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:16.030 align:middle line:84%
the square root of s
is the invariant mass.

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:26.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the effective mass
of the whole system.

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.890 align:middle line:90%


00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Of this though, when I
say the whole system,

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:37.390 align:middle line:84%
I just mean, the whole system
of particle 1, particle 2,

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:38.500 align:middle line:90%
and also the final state.

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:46.660 align:middle line:90%


00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:52.060 align:middle line:84%
So we can also write
this sigma, turns out

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:56.760 align:middle line:84%
we can actually write sigma
in terms of s, because the--

00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:08.340 align:middle line:90%


00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:15.330 align:middle line:84%
so because P1 dot P2 can
be written as 1/2 half

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:23.170 align:middle line:84%
P1 plus P2 squared minus
P1 squared minus P2 square.

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:25.180 align:middle line:90%
So this is just m squared.

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.220 align:middle line:84%
So P1 squared is
minus m1 squared.

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:29.510 align:middle line:90%
P2 squared is minus m2 squared.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:37.380 align:middle line:84%
So this is just equal
to minus 1/2 s--

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:40.710 align:middle line:90%
sorry, it should be totaled.

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:45.460 align:middle line:84%
S minus m1 squared
minus m2 square.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:50.230 align:middle line:84%
so P1 and P2 squared is
just equal to minus s.

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And then, the sigma
just then, just

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.620 align:middle line:84%
can be expressed
in terms of that.

00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:00.160 align:middle line:84%
So the sigma-- so let me just
write down the final expression

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:05.830 align:middle line:84%
for the sigma in terms of
s, just equal to square root

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:16.690 align:middle line:84%
s squared 2s m1 squared plus m2
squared plus m1 squared minus 2

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:18.005 align:middle line:90%
squared squared.

00:40:18.005 --> 00:40:20.570 align:middle line:90%


00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:23.050 align:middle line:84%
So this whole kinematic
factor of sigma

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:25.045 align:middle line:84%
can be just expressed
in terms of s.

00:40:25.045 --> 00:40:36.660 align:middle line:90%


00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:37.625 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:40:37.625 --> 00:41:01.470 align:middle line:90%


00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:06.180 align:middle line:84%
So now, another thing
is that often, we--

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:10.930 align:middle line:90%


00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:15.370 align:middle line:84%
even though this formula
can be used in any frame,

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:19.150 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes, depending
on your question,

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:21.910 align:middle line:84%
the expression is
simpler in some frame

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:24.400 align:middle line:90%
than some other frame.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.830 align:middle line:84%
So one of the very
frequently used frame

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:28.720 align:middle line:84%
is so-called the
center of mass frame.

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:33.430 align:middle line:90%


00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:35.110 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
center of mass frame.

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:39.330 align:middle line:84%
So in the center of mass frame,
so the center of mass frame,

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:46.810 align:middle line:84%
essentially, it's in this frame
that the total center of mass

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:48.820 align:middle line:90%
of the system does not move.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:52.750 align:middle line:84%
So it means that the total
momentum in the center

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:55.440 align:middle line:90%
of mass frame, total momentum--

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.410 align:middle line:90%


00:41:58.410 --> 00:42:00.680 align:middle line:90%
let me see.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:07.265 align:middle line:84%
The total momentum equal
to p1 p2 is taken to be 0.

00:42:07.265 --> 00:42:10.340 align:middle line:90%


00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:14.060 align:middle line:84%
So the full system
is not moving.

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And so, that means
we can take --

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:21.170 align:middle line:84%
so means that P1
equal to minus P2,

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:26.070 align:middle line:90%
so equal to, let's call it Pcm.

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:27.820 align:middle line:84%
It just means the
center of mass momentum.

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:33.100 align:middle line:90%


00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:42.610 align:middle line:84%
And now, you can find the
Pcm from just solving the--

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:46.640 align:middle line:84%
you can also express the
Pcm in terms of the mass,

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:53.270 align:middle line:84%
it's because E1 plus E2
equal to square root of s.

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:55.160 align:middle line:90%
So this is the total.

00:42:55.160 --> 00:43:00.110 align:middle line:84%
So in the center of mass
frame, the total momentum is 0.

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:05.190 align:middle line:90%
Then that means that E1E2--

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:08.790 align:middle line:84%
so here, there's no
spatial part contribution.

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And here, you just have E1
plus E2 squared equal to s.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:17.040 align:middle line:84%
So E1 plus E2 equal
to square root s.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you can actually
solve for p by plus m1 squared

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:39.440 align:middle line:84%
plus m2 squared equal
to square root of s.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:43.505 align:middle line:84%
So you can now, solve the
center of mass in terms of s.

00:43:43.505 --> 00:43:47.130 align:middle line:90%


00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is a simple equation,
which you can solve.

00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:54.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is a middle
school equation.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:58.020 align:middle line:84%
But turns out the
result is very simple.

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Turns out the Pcm, the magnitude
when you solve this equation,

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:14.280 align:middle line:84%
you find that this is precisely
equal to this sigma divided

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:15.540 align:middle line:90%
by square root s.

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:23.940 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very
beautiful simple formula,

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:27.060 align:middle line:84%
given by sigma divided
by square root of s.

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Or in other words,
the sigma can be

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:33.930 align:middle line:84%
written in terms of the center
of mass, momentum and magnitude

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:40.373 align:middle line:84%
times the square root
s, times square root s.

00:44:40.373 --> 00:44:44.080 align:middle line:90%


00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:48.150 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can simplify
that the expression

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:49.035 align:middle line:90%
center of mass frame.

00:44:49.035 --> 00:44:53.910 align:middle line:90%


00:44:53.910 --> 00:45:24.870 align:middle line:84%
So in the center
of mass frame, now

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:middle line:84%
we have in the
center of mass frame,

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:33.910 align:middle line:84%
now we have the
sigma is equal to--

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:35.750 align:middle line:90%
so let me just save.

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just you should assume
that the subscript alpha

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:46.990 align:middle line:84%
to beta, d mu, and then divided
by 4, center of mass momentum,

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:49.720 align:middle line:84%
magnitude of center of
mass of momentum times

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:51.910 align:middle line:90%
square root of s.

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:54.865 align:middle line:84%
So we have a very
simple formula.

00:45:54.865 --> 00:46:15.580 align:middle line:90%


00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:19.630 align:middle line:84%
So the most of the
time, for most questions

00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:24.037 align:middle line:84%
we are interested in, as you
will see in next lecture,

00:46:24.037 --> 00:46:25.870 align:middle line:84%
so most question we are
interesting actually

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:27.640 align:middle line:84%
corresponding to
2 to 2 scattering.

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So now let's specifier
2 to 2 scatterings.

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:37.660 align:middle line:84%
So the final state only also
only contain two particles.

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:41.080 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, we
can simplify the d mu,

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:42.745 align:middle line:90%
further simplify d mu.

00:46:42.745 --> 00:46:46.230 align:middle line:90%


00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:47.850 align:middle line:90%
So let's just write down the--

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:50.010 align:middle line:84%
so in the 2 to 2 scattering,
you essentially you

00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:58.350 align:middle line:84%
have some particle
come in, say p1 p2,

00:46:58.350 --> 00:47:01.320 align:middle line:84%
and then you have two
final particle k1, k2.

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:04.350 align:middle line:90%


00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:05.520 align:middle line:90%
And then they're intact.

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:09.890 align:middle line:90%


00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So now let's write down this
d mu explicitly for this case.

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's write down d mu
explicitly for this case.

00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:22.570 align:middle line:90%
So the d mu, just given by--

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:26.990 align:middle line:90%


00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:31.175 align:middle line:90%
so P1 plus P2 minus k1 minus k2.

00:47:31.175 --> 00:47:34.240 align:middle line:90%


00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And then times, d3 k1
divided by 2 pi cubed 2k 1,0.

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Let's just call it 2 1 k0
E1 prime and d3 k2 2 pi

00:47:58.350 --> 00:48:01.830 align:middle line:90%
cubed, then 2 E2 prime.

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:05.070 align:middle line:90%


00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So the E1 prime
and E2 prime, they

00:48:07.090 --> 00:48:09.810 align:middle line:90%
are just energy for k1 and k2.

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:18.910 align:middle line:84%
So E1 prime equal to
k 1,0 E2 prime k2.

00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:24.090 align:middle line:90%


00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:36.015 align:middle line:84%
For example, yeah,
so I will deload

00:48:36.015 --> 00:48:39.950 align:middle line:84%
to the mass for the
two final particles,

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:43.550 align:middle line:90%
m1 prime and m2 prime.

00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So m prime 2 prime
will be the mass

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:48.110 align:middle line:90%
of the two final particles.

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:58.390 align:middle line:90%


00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:03.110 align:middle line:84%
So before simplifying
this a little bit further,

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:06.670 align:middle line:84%
let us first introduce
some notations.

00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:09.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's often convenient
so many of you

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:13.000 align:middle line:84%
may have already
seen this before,

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.680 align:middle line:84%
often convenient to introduce
the following quantities--

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:20.890 align:middle line:90%


00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:23.160 align:middle line:84%
so essentially, they
characterize all the Lorentz

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:33.280 align:middle line:84%
invariant quantities we can
build up from k P1 P2, k1 k2.

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:37.030 align:middle line:84%
So you can have
so-called t is defined

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:42.130 align:middle line:84%
to be minus p1 minus k1
square, which is also

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:45.520 align:middle line:84%
the same from the momentum
conservation, p2 minus k2

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:47.900 align:middle line:90%
square.

00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:58.670 align:middle line:84%
So u minus p1 minus k2
square, the same, minus p2

00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:59.750 align:middle line:90%
minus k1 square.

00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:03.290 align:middle line:90%


00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:10.040 align:middle line:84%
So let me just copy the
s is p1 plus p2 squared.

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:18.430 align:middle line:90%


00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So these are the quantities,
which are obviously

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Lorentz invariant.

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And they are the
Lorentz invariant.

00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:27.990 align:middle line:90%
You can build up--

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Lorentz invariant
quantities, you

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:34.650 align:middle line:84%
can build up from
say, p1 p2, k1 and k2.

00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:38.100 align:middle line:84%
So any Lorentz
invariant quantities,

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:42.780 align:middle line:84%
which you can build from
those four momentum,

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:48.210 align:middle line:84%
can be expressed in terms of
some combinations of s t u.

00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:51.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, s to u themselves, are
not independent of each other.

00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:55.140 align:middle line:84%
There's only two independent
Lorentz invariants.

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:56.550 align:middle line:84%
With momentum
conservation, there

00:50:56.550 --> 00:51:00.840 align:middle line:84%
are only two independent Lorentz
invariants you can introduce.

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:05.307 align:middle line:84%
So s plus t and plus
u is actually not

00:51:05.307 --> 00:51:06.390 align:middle line:90%
independent of each other.

00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:08.010 align:middle line:90%
You can show.

00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:10.545 align:middle line:84%
So this again, I give you
the exercise for yourself.

00:51:10.545 --> 00:51:18.210 align:middle line:90%


00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:20.400 align:middle line:90%
You can show that.

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you know any of the
two, then you know the s,

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.270 align:middle line:90%
you know the other one.

00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And anything can be expressed
in terms of these variables

00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:33.050 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:36.790 align:middle line:90%


00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:37.978 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:51:37.978 --> 00:51:41.950 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Written down,
definitions are useful,

00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:44.020 align:middle line:90%
for instance, these.

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:47.613 align:middle line:84%
How do they correspond
to different kinematics?

00:51:47.613 --> 00:51:49.280 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: What do you
mean, how do they?

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.522 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Feynman diagrams.

00:51:50.522 --> 00:51:51.980 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Oh yeah,
then you Feynman

00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:56.060 align:middle line:84%
diagrams can be conveniently
expressed in terms of them,

00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:58.535 align:middle line:84%
as we will see in next
lecture and in homework.

00:51:58.535 --> 00:52:01.810 align:middle line:90%


00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:06.260 align:middle line:84%
So this quantity this
quantity is Lorentz invariant.

00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:08.740 align:middle line:84%
So that can be
conveniently expressed

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.150 align:middle line:90%
in terms of those quantities.

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:19.080 align:middle line:90%


00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:26.520 align:middle line:84%
So now, including the d
mu, so now, let's further

00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:29.700 align:middle line:84%
simplify d mu in the
center of mass frame.

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:33.160 align:middle line:84%
So this quantity, we can
try to simplify further.

00:52:33.160 --> 00:53:14.820 align:middle line:84%
So we can-- so
now, let's consider

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:17.820 align:middle line:84%
to do this in the
center of mass frame.

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:21.090 align:middle line:84%
So in the center of
mass frame, for 2 to 2

00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:23.760 align:middle line:84%
scattering is
particularly simple,

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:28.380 align:middle line:84%
because your incoming particle
have the opposite momentum.

00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:30.750 align:middle line:90%
So one is Pcm.

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And the y will be minus Pcm
and the spatial momentum.

00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And then the final
particle, they

00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.990 align:middle line:84%
must also have
opposite momentum.

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Because the total momentum,
total spatial momentum

00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:52.170 align:middle line:84%
in the center of
mass frame is 0.

00:53:52.170 --> 00:53:57.240 align:middle line:84%
So let's can call
this k cm then this

00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:05.960 align:middle line:84%
must be minus k cm
OK, must be minus cm.

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:08.780 align:middle line:84%
So for simplicity, let's
just call this k cm just k.

00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:13.100 align:middle line:90%


00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:16.820 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can just -- now
let's just with this in mind,

00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and let's just
look at this d mu.

00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:21.920 align:middle line:90%
Look at this d mu.

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:26.950 align:middle line:90%


00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:30.290 align:middle line:90%
So there are a few steps.

00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:34.360 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we don't
want to go through all

00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:35.965 align:middle line:90%
the details of these steps.

00:54:35.965 --> 00:54:41.240 align:middle line:90%


00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:41.740 align:middle line:90%
Let me.

00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:48.880 align:middle line:84%
See I think, yeah, let me
just outline some here.

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:53.500 align:middle line:84%
So we'll try to only go
through some of the steps,

00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:56.770 align:middle line:90%
not to doing all the steps.

00:54:56.770 --> 00:55:01.480 align:middle line:84%
So now in the center
of mass frame, then

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:05.720 align:middle line:84%
you find this d mu
can be written as--

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:08.600 align:middle line:90%
so first, these two pi forth.

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And then you have two
factor of 2 pi cubed.

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.980 align:middle line:90%
And then you cancel.

00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:14.645 align:middle line:90%
So you have this 2 pi squared.

00:55:14.645 --> 00:55:17.390 align:middle line:90%


00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Then you have 4
E1 prime E2 prime.

00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Then you have one
set of functions.

00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So you have k1, you
have E1 prime plus E2

00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:41.000 align:middle line:84%
prime minus square root
s times delta 3 k1 plus

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:48.950 align:middle line:90%
k2 and the d3 k1 and d3 k2.

00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:53.210 align:middle line:84%
So as we said, the k3, they
have to be equal and opposite

00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:53.795 align:middle line:90%
to each other.

00:55:53.795 --> 00:55:56.340 align:middle line:90%


00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And then you can just
evaluate one delta function.

00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
dk will remain.

00:56:01.550 --> 00:56:04.960 align:middle line:90%
The other dk will remain.

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:08.590 align:middle line:90%
So essentially, you just have--

00:56:08.590 --> 00:56:11.220 align:middle line:84%
essentially, we can
just forget about this.

00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And then you just have
dk, just have dk, d3k.

00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:20.800 align:middle line:90%


00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And this d3k, you
can write it as dk,

00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:33.000 align:middle line:84%
the magnitude of k and k square,
and then the center of mass --

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.210 align:middle line:84%
solid angle the angle in
the center of mass frame.

00:56:36.210 --> 00:56:40.170 align:middle line:84%
So this k vector can be
decomposed into the angular

00:56:40.170 --> 00:56:43.290 align:middle line:90%
directions and the magnitude.

00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And then, now both E1
and E2 are expressed

00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:53.280 align:middle line:84%
in terms of k squared
plus m1 prime squared

00:56:53.280 --> 00:57:00.810 align:middle line:84%
and the E2 prime is equal to k
squared plus m2 prime squared.

00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:10.370 align:middle line:90%


00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:14.105 align:middle line:84%
So, now you can further
evaluate this delta function.

00:57:14.105 --> 00:57:18.470 align:middle line:90%


00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Now you can further
evaluate this function.

00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Because the E1
prime and E2 prime,

00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:28.450 align:middle line:84%
they're just the functions
of magnitude of k squared.

00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:31.180 align:middle line:84%
So you can evaluate
this delta function.

00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:36.130 align:middle line:84%
You have dk over the
magnitude of k here.

00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:39.700 align:middle line:84%
So you can do that, so I
will not go into detail.

00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:42.140 align:middle line:90%
I will not going to detail.

00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And so, when you do that, when
you solve that delta function

00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:50.850 align:middle line:84%
and then you find
from here, then you

00:57:50.850 --> 00:57:54.850 align:middle line:84%
find that the final
answer is given by--

00:57:54.850 --> 00:57:57.800 align:middle line:84%
you find the final answer
is given by very simple.

00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:07.730 align:middle line:84%
You find given by k cm divided
by 14 pi square square root s

00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:09.715 align:middle line:90%
d omega center of mass.

00:58:09.715 --> 00:58:13.390 align:middle line:90%


00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And this k cm is defined to be
the solution of this equation.

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:29.590 align:middle line:84%
So k cm is the solution
to E1 prime plus E2

00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:32.680 align:middle line:90%
prime equal to square root s.

00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:35.755 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is expressed
in terms of the s.

00:58:35.755 --> 00:58:43.180 align:middle line:90%


00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:46.450 align:middle line:84%
So through some,
just technically,

00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:47.905 align:middle line:84%
just evaluate this
delta function.

00:58:47.905 --> 00:58:51.370 align:middle line:90%


00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.587 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So when
we calculate this,

00:58:54.587 --> 00:58:56.170 align:middle line:84%
are we integrating
over all the cases?

00:58:56.170 --> 00:59:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Is that why we can evaluate
all these type of functions?

00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:02.440 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: So you
only evaluate the k

00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:05.615 align:middle line:90%
around the momentum shell.

00:59:05.615 --> 00:59:07.240 align:middle line:84%
So you can evaluate
the delta function,

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:10.330 align:middle line:84%
because we always have a finite
range of k to integrate over.

00:59:10.330 --> 00:59:14.380 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't matter how
wide the range of this.

00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:18.805 align:middle line:84%
Because the non-zero value of
the mu is always around that

00:59:18.805 --> 00:59:21.070 align:middle line:84%
will satisfy the
momentum conservation.

00:59:21.070 --> 00:59:23.898 align:middle line:90%


00:59:23.898 --> 00:59:25.190 align:middle line:90%
Does this answer your question?

00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:26.800 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:28.340 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, good.

00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:30.170 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:31.850 align:middle line:90%
Here, I didn't write--

00:59:31.850 --> 00:59:36.860 align:middle line:84%
I think, you may wonder here, I
didn't write the integral sign.

00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:40.950 align:middle line:84%
How can I just evaluate
the delta function?

00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:43.010 align:middle line:84%
The reason you can
evaluate delta function

00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:48.350 align:middle line:84%
is just no matter what is the
range of dk you integrate over,

00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:52.670 align:middle line:84%
you will always evaluate
around those delta functions.

00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And so you can always
take care of them.

00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:59.310 align:middle line:90%


00:59:59.310 --> 01:00:09.270 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you combine this
result and this result,

01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:14.030 align:middle line:84%
and now, you can write a
simple expression for d sigma

01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:17.810 align:middle line:90%
in the center of mass frame.

01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:19.550 align:middle line:84%
So if you combine
them together, then we

01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:27.080 align:middle line:84%
find the sigma, the omega
center of mass frame,

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:36.605 align:middle line:84%
is equal to M alpha beta
squared divided by 16,

01:00:36.605 --> 01:00:45.100 align:middle line:84%
64 pi square s and
k cm divided by pcm.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And the k cm is the
solution to this equation.

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And the pcm is the
solution to this equation.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:57.770 align:middle line:84%
So the pcm is the
equation to this equation.

01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:59.780 align:middle line:84%
So they are given by
the same equation,

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:05.420 align:middle line:84%
just replace the m1 m2
by m1 prime and m2 prime.

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:09.800 align:middle line:84%
So this is the final answer for
the differential cross section

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:15.560 align:middle line:84%
for 2 to 2 scattering in
the center of mass frame,

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:19.310 align:middle line:90%
in the center of mass frame.

01:01:19.310 --> 01:01:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
expression, which

01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:25.540 align:middle line:90%
we will use later for certain--

01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:30.290 align:middle line:90%


01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:31.460 align:middle line:90%
do you have any questions?

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:35.490 align:middle line:90%


01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:37.200 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So this concludes the
discussion of the cross section.

01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:45.670 align:middle line:90%
So it's finally over.

01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:48.340 align:middle line:90%
It's finally over.

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:51.190 align:middle line:84%
But we have to go through
this, because this

01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:57.450 align:middle line:84%
is the kind of thing which
we compare with experiments.

01:01:57.450 --> 01:01:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, if you
calculate the total cross

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:01.500 align:middle line:84%
section, and then you
can just integrate

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.060 align:middle line:90%
this over all the solid angle.

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:08.260 align:middle line:90%


01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:12.950 align:middle line:84%
So before now, talking
about the physical process,

01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:15.560 align:middle line:84%
there's one more thing
we need to consider.

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:22.820 align:middle line:84%
So here, we consider the initial
state to be two particles.

01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Because we say we don't
normally do scattering

01:02:25.850 --> 01:02:29.900 align:middle line:90%
with more than two particles.

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:35.825 align:middle line:84%
But there's another situation,
which still often could happen.

01:02:35.825 --> 01:02:38.630 align:middle line:90%


01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is the situation,
which initial state only

01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:43.175 align:middle line:90%
have one particle.

01:02:43.175 --> 01:02:45.810 align:middle line:90%


01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So when your initial state
only have one particle,

01:02:49.050 --> 01:02:50.040 align:middle line:90%
what do you have?

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:50.753 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Decay.

01:02:50.753 --> 01:02:52.920 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, then that
is corresponding to decay.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so we can still
have the situation.

01:02:57.270 --> 01:03:00.930 align:middle line:84%
If you have an unstable
particle, then we can decay.

01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And then it's very important for
many, many physical situations,

01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:07.560 align:middle line:90%
to calculate the decay rate.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:13.880 align:middle line:90%


01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:18.560 align:middle line:84%
So now we have p1, say, suppose
this is the initial momentum.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And decay into k1 plus
kn, say final n particles.

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:28.250 align:middle line:84%
So now the initial
state, only one particle.

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:31.190 align:middle line:90%
And the final state is k1 kn.

01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:35.870 align:middle line:84%
So beta remain the same,
but alpha only one particle.

01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:42.895 align:middle line:84%
And the decay rate is
much simpler to define,

01:03:42.895 --> 01:03:49.770 align:middle line:90%
it's just the dP alpha beta dt.

01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And we don't need to divide
it by flux, all those things.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.290 align:middle line:90%


01:03:57.290 --> 01:04:00.690 align:middle line:84%
So now let me
explain a little bit.

01:04:00.690 --> 01:04:03.815 align:middle line:84%
Again, this dP alpha
beta, we always mean--

01:04:03.815 --> 01:04:09.400 align:middle line:90%


01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:15.280 align:middle line:84%
we mean that the
probability of P1

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:21.820 align:middle line:90%
decaying into n final particles.

01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:28.350 align:middle line:90%


01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:44.330 align:middle line:84%
with again, particle
1 with range,

01:04:44.330 --> 01:04:58.020 align:middle line:84%
with the decay 1 around k1 and
the decay around k2, et cetera,

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:01.580 align:middle line:90%
and decay n around kn.

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:06.050 align:middle line:84%
So when we write d alpha
beta, you should imagine this.

01:05:06.050 --> 01:05:07.220 align:middle line:90%
We already include that.

01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:11.120 align:middle line:90%


01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can just
repeat what we did before.

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:26.670 align:middle line:84%
So then, this dP alpha beta dt,
dP alpha beta, then just given

01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:34.510 align:middle line:84%
by this thing squared, beta plus
infinity square and alpha minus

01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:43.390 align:middle line:84%
infinity squared, divided
by beta and alpha.

01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And times j from 1 to n,
d3 kj 2 pi cubed times V.

01:05:58.550 --> 01:06:00.890 align:middle line:90%
So now, it's the same thing.

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:02.870 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's same thing.

01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:07.100 align:middle line:90%
So the only thing you need to --

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and the alpha one,
everything else is the same.

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.640 align:middle line:90%
So everything else is the same.

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.400 align:middle line:84%
So you just repeat
our previous analysis,

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.530 align:middle line:90%
which I will not repeat.

01:06:19.530 --> 01:06:22.130 align:middle line:84%
So the only thing different
is just now the initial state

01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:25.520 align:middle line:90%
is just to a single energy.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So you just repeat
the whole thing.

01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:31.100 align:middle line:90%
And then you find--

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:35.420 align:middle line:84%
then you find d Gamma
alpha beta equal

01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:43.330 align:middle line:90%
to dP alpha beta divided by t.

01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And then you find that
this is just given

01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:55.180 align:middle line:90%
by 2E1 alpha beta square d mu.

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:58.060 align:middle line:90%
D mu is defined in the same way.

01:06:58.060 --> 01:06:59.500 align:middle line:90%
D mu is defined in the same way.

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:03.130 align:middle line:90%


01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:08.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is the final
answer for the decay case.

01:07:08.110 --> 01:07:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And the total decay rate
would be you integrate just

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:13.530 align:middle line:90%
over all momentum.

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:19.790 align:middle line:90%


01:07:19.790 --> 01:07:21.095 align:middle line:90%
So the total decay rate--

01:07:21.095 --> 01:07:50.940 align:middle line:90%


01:07:50.940 --> 01:08:00.350 align:middle line:84%
so the total decay rate
is just gamma total rate.

01:08:00.350 --> 01:08:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Then gamma is summing over
all possible choices of beta.

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:06.785 align:middle line:84%
And then you integrate
over all momentum.

01:08:06.785 --> 01:08:11.090 align:middle line:90%


01:08:11.090 --> 01:08:18.859 align:middle line:84%
And the lifetime of
the particle, tau

01:08:18.859 --> 01:08:20.180 align:middle line:90%
is just equal to 1 over gamma.

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:26.800 align:middle line:90%


01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:32.600 align:middle line:84%
So one thing, one difference
with the cross section case--

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:35.540 align:middle line:84%
so the cross action
we mentioned before,

01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:38.850 align:middle line:90%
say it's Lorentz invariant.

01:08:38.850 --> 01:08:41.130 align:middle line:90%
But decay rate is not.

01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And decay rate does depend
on the frame of the particle,

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:49.450 align:middle line:84%
does depend on the
frame of the particle.

01:08:49.450 --> 01:08:54.970 align:middle line:84%
So decay rate-- so
this lifetime does

01:08:54.970 --> 01:08:57.910 align:middle line:84%
depend on the frame
of the particle

01:08:57.910 --> 01:09:09.569 align:middle line:84%
and the rest frame
of the particle,

01:09:09.569 --> 01:09:12.660 align:middle line:84%
corresponding to
just E equal to m1,

01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:16.109 align:middle line:84%
just equal to mass
of the particle.

01:09:16.109 --> 01:09:23.729 align:middle line:84%
And so the rest frame
decay rate is the smallest

01:09:23.729 --> 01:09:28.470 align:middle line:84%
among all possible decay rate
because of the time dilation.

01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:33.010 align:middle line:90%


01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:37.500 align:middle line:84%
In all other moving frame,
because the time dilation,

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.779 align:middle line:90%
the decay rate become faster.

01:09:39.779 --> 01:09:45.090 align:middle line:84%
So that's what you meant,
that the particles are moving

01:09:45.090 --> 01:09:47.910 align:middle line:90%
and they have a longer lifetime.

01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:50.990 align:middle line:90%
They have a longer lifetime.

01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:55.390 align:middle line:90%
So this makes perfect sense.

01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:58.890 align:middle line:90%
So any questions on this?

01:09:58.890 --> 01:09:59.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:09:59.390 --> 01:10:02.040 align:middle line:90%


01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:04.160 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Do you
need a finite set?

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:08.120 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, in general,
in general, for the real--

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:15.990 align:middle line:84%
you never know, but beta
is what we discovered.

01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:18.960 align:middle line:84%
We observe what are the
decay final product.

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:21.550 align:middle line:84%
But you can also predict,
from your theory,

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:23.790 align:middle line:90%
what are the possible decay?

01:10:23.790 --> 01:10:25.770 align:middle line:84%
But in real experiment,
there always

01:10:25.770 --> 01:10:29.160 align:middle line:84%
may be some particles
we don't know.

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:32.790 align:middle line:84%
There may be some
hidden interactions.

01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:35.920 align:middle line:90%


01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:36.880 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:39.420 align:middle line:90%


01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:41.870 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:45.260 align:middle line:84%
So that finally concludes this
discussion of the cross section

01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:47.480 align:middle line:90%
and the decay rate.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And now, we can
study some process.

01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:53.870 align:middle line:84%
So we only have 10
minutes to do it.

01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:58.530 align:middle line:90%


01:10:58.530 --> 01:11:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So we will not really be able to
do it, just maybe to start it.

01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:18.150 align:middle line:90%


01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:22.630 align:middle line:84%
So in general, we will
consider 2 to 2 scatterings.

01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:33.550 align:middle line:84%
OK In general, we consider
2 to 2 scatterings.

01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:39.220 align:middle line:90%
And so one remark to make--

01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and in that case, we
have this formula.

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:44.920 align:middle line:90%
We have this very nice formula.

01:11:44.920 --> 01:12:03.220 align:middle line:84%
So for particles, with spin,
say whether spin 1/2 or spin 1.

01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Spin 1/2 would be electrons,
protons, et cetera.

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:09.700 align:middle line:90%
And spin 1 would be photon.

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And the scattering
amplitude then

01:12:15.370 --> 01:12:30.610 align:middle line:84%
will depend on the polarization
of the initial and final

01:12:30.610 --> 01:12:31.420 align:middle line:90%
particles.

01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:42.960 align:middle line:90%


01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:44.880 align:middle line:90%
So in most experiments --

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:48.330 align:middle line:90%


01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:57.520 align:middle line:84%
in most experiments,
so the initial beam,

01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:00.490 align:middle line:84%
they are unpolarized,
it's not easy,

01:13:00.490 --> 01:13:02.500 align:middle line:84%
sometimes to do
the polarized beam.

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:10.110 align:middle line:84%
So initial state, initial
beams are unpolarized--

01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:14.140 align:middle line:90%


01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:16.210 align:middle line:84%
unpolarized means they're
just corresponding

01:13:16.210 --> 01:13:19.810 align:middle line:84%
to a superposition
of all possible kinds

01:13:19.810 --> 01:13:25.930 align:middle line:84%
of polarizations,
incoherent superposition.

01:13:25.930 --> 01:13:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And then the final state
and the spin polarization,

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:50.110 align:middle line:84%
a final state normally,
it cannot be detected.

01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:53.500 align:middle line:90%


01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:56.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a difficult
question to detect

01:13:56.650 --> 01:13:58.650 align:middle line:90%
the polarization of a particle.

01:13:58.650 --> 01:14:01.450 align:middle line:90%


01:14:01.450 --> 01:14:04.030 align:middle line:90%
And actually, it's not even--

01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:06.550 align:middle line:84%
say if you say,
observe a new particle,

01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:10.420 align:middle line:84%
it's not even easy to tell
whether this particle is

01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:12.010 align:middle line:90%
a boson or fermion.

01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:16.600 align:middle line:84%
So to measure the specific
polarization is even harder.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so the
polarization of final state

01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:24.260 align:middle line:90%
are normally not detected.

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:27.620 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, when we
compare with experiment,

01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:30.940 align:middle line:84%
so when we calculate this
kind of cross section

01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:38.035 align:middle line:84%
compare with
experiment, we should--

01:14:38.035 --> 01:14:52.160 align:middle line:90%


01:14:52.160 --> 01:15:01.130 align:middle line:84%
that means that we should
to compare with experiment.

01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:09.890 align:middle line:84%
We should sum over,
should sum over

01:15:09.890 --> 01:15:16.895 align:middle line:90%
polarizations of final state.

01:15:16.895 --> 01:15:24.720 align:middle line:90%


01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:38.535 align:middle line:84%
and average over polarizations
of initial state.

01:15:38.535 --> 01:15:43.440 align:middle line:90%


01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:46.500 align:middle line:84%
So for the final state,
we need to sum over them.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Because we need to sum
over all possibilities.

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:54.350 align:middle line:84%
But for the initial state
all different polarizations

01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:55.070 align:middle line:90%
contribute.

01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:57.470 align:middle line:90%
So we need to average over them.

01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:58.730 align:middle line:90%
We need to average over them.

01:15:58.730 --> 01:16:01.470 align:middle line:90%


01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:21.080 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if we
consider such a process,

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:26.500 align:middle line:84%
it's a very important
process, say

01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:29.360 align:middle line:84%
in QED is your
annhilation of particles.

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:31.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a particle
and antiparticle,

01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:33.990 align:middle line:90%
then they can annihilate.

01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:38.250 align:middle line:84%
When they annihilate, then
they annihilate into photon.

01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And then the photon can split
into some other particle

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:42.570 align:middle line:90%
and antiparticle.

01:16:42.570 --> 01:16:45.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is the process
of particle a come in.

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:54.370 align:middle line:90%


01:16:54.370 --> 01:16:59.770 align:middle line:84%
So this is a, a-bar,
this is b and b-bar.

01:16:59.770 --> 01:17:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So this is a production,
the pair creation

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:07.270 align:middle line:84%
of b and b-bar from colliding
and its antiparticle.

01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:11.700 align:middle line:84%
So in real life, in
real life, by colliding,

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:17.010 align:middle line:84%
say, for example, electron
plus positron, then

01:17:17.010 --> 01:17:19.120 align:middle line:90%
you can create many particles.

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:25.200 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the
most important way

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:27.450 align:middle line:90%
to discover new particles.

01:17:27.450 --> 01:17:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Many new particles are
discovered this way.

01:17:29.790 --> 01:17:32.370 align:middle line:84%
You just collide the
electron and positron.

01:17:32.370 --> 01:17:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And then you will be able
to create new particles.

01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:41.190 align:middle line:84%
For example, you can
create muon and anti-muon.

01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And then you can create quarks
and antiquark, et cetera.

01:17:49.150 --> 01:17:57.980 align:middle line:90%


01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:01.790 align:middle line:84%
So in all these cases, both the
initial and final particles,

01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:03.710 align:middle line:90%
they are fermions.

01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:05.880 align:middle line:84%
So you need to specify
their polarization.

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:09.290 align:middle line:84%
So this one --
supposed we have p1 r1.

01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:11.150 align:middle line:90%
So here we have p2.

01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:18.240 align:middle line:84%
So since this is antiparticle,
let's call it r2-bar.

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.910 align:middle line:90%
And the b would be called--

01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:23.460 align:middle line:90%
say this is k1 s1.

01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:25.200 align:middle line:90%
Say this is k2 s2-bar.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:29.940 align:middle line:90%


01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And then for the
unpolarized process,

01:18:33.130 --> 01:18:35.445 align:middle line:84%
let me just write
down one last formula.

01:18:35.445 --> 01:18:47.780 align:middle line:90%


01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:51.670 align:middle line:84%
So you need to say, suppose
the scattering amplitude is

01:18:51.670 --> 01:18:59.190 align:middle line:84%
M squared, so M.
And then we need to,

01:18:59.190 --> 01:19:09.300 align:middle line:84%
for unpolarized
process, so we need

01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:14.730 align:middle line:84%
to consider-- we need to average
initial spin, r1, and average

01:19:14.730 --> 01:19:17.835 align:middle line:90%
over the final, the r2.

01:19:17.835 --> 01:19:20.730 align:middle line:90%


01:19:20.730 --> 01:19:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And then we need to sum
over s1 and the sum over s2.

01:19:26.730 --> 01:19:30.420 align:middle line:90%
And then, I have Musk squared.

01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:33.990 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, this
becomes 1 over 4.

01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And you sum over all
possible spin polarizations

01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:40.050 align:middle line:90%
of the M squared.

01:19:40.050 --> 01:19:45.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is the one we can
say compare with experiments.

01:19:45.330 --> 01:19:50.400 align:middle line:84%
So next time, we will
write this down explicitly

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:51.460 align:middle line:90%
for this kind of process.

01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:54.000 align:middle line:90%


01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so let's stop here.

01:19:56.940 --> 01:20:01.000 align:middle line:90%
