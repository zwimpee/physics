00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.700 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: So at the
end of last lecture,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.420 align:middle line:84%
so we discussed this LSZ
theorem, which tells you

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:26.740 align:middle line:84%
how to obtain scattering
amplitude from correlation

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.170 align:middle line:84%
functions, from time-ordered
correlation functions.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.670 align:middle line:84%
OK, so if you want
to compute, say,

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.870 align:middle line:84%
some scattering amplitude from
alpha to beta-- so alpha's

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.470 align:middle line:84%
some initial state and
beta's some final state.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Say alpha consists of
momentum p1 and PN--

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:58.380 align:middle line:84%
or pm, and beta, say
momentum p m plus 1 and pn.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And then you can get
this scattering amplitude

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.880 align:middle line:84%
just by taking your
momentum-space correlation

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.520 align:middle line:90%
function, OK, for the n points.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.430 align:middle line:84%
So all together,
you have an n points

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.730 align:middle line:84%
for the external
momentum, OK, and then

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.150 align:middle line:90%
you take the on-shell limit.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:84%
You take the on-shell
limit, and then that

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:36.950 align:middle line:84%
gives you the product of the
external propagators, then

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.830 align:middle line:90%
times the scattering amplitude.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
relation, OK, so here I

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.960 align:middle line:84%
have stripped out the momentum
conservation on both sides.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Of course, momentum
has to be conserved.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Inside, the total
momentum has to be zero.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And so this limit is
the on-shell limit,

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and in the on-shell limit,
the initial momentum--

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.400 align:middle line:84%
OK, actually, I should
call it minus p.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.550 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, it's minus pm.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.750 align:middle line:84%
So the initial
momentum, for those

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.280 align:middle line:84%
with the initial momentum,
you take p1 to be--

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.130 align:middle line:90%
p1 0 to have minus omega p1, OK?

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.590 align:middle line:90%
For the final momentum--

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.505 align:middle line:90%
so p alpha.

00:02:37.505 --> 00:02:40.150 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.300 align:middle line:84%
For the final momentum,
you take the p beta

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:52.120 align:middle line:84%
0 goes to omega p beta, the
final, OK, with the plus sign.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.180 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's how you
distinguish the initial state

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.890 align:middle line:84%
from the final state, because
when you obtain a correlation

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.890 align:middle line:84%
function, you don't
distinguish what

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.680 align:middle line:84%
is the initial and
the final state.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.400 align:middle line:90%
You just have some momentum.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.930 align:middle line:84%
This is a function of
some arbitrary momentum.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.690 align:middle line:84%
But the scattering
amplitude, of course,

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.850 align:middle line:84%
those momentum are on shell,
and so the way you distinguish

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.670 align:middle line:84%
the initial momentum
and the final momentum

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.900 align:middle line:84%
is by taking the
initial momentum,

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.100 align:middle line:84%
say to go to the negative
root, and the final momentum

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.960 align:middle line:90%
to take the positive root.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.430 align:middle line:84%
But since the alpha, it
consists of minus p1, and then

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.090 align:middle line:84%
the initial state, you
have positive energy, OK,

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.130 align:middle line:90%
you have positive energy.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So this tells you that when
we compute the scattering

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.280 align:middle line:90%
amplitude--

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.180 align:middle line:90%


00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.815 align:middle line:84%
when we compute the scattering
amplitude, we should take the--

00:03:56.815 --> 00:04:00.250 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:08.070 align:middle line:84%
we just take all
the Feynman diagrams

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.280 align:middle line:84%
which you used to calculate
these correlation functions,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.245 align:middle line:90%
OK, and then you sum over--

00:04:13.245 --> 00:04:18.180 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.300 align:middle line:84%
you sum over, say,
the truncated--

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.270 align:middle line:90%


00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:84%
so you see the relation between
these correlation functions

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.100 align:middle line:90%
and the scattering amplitudes.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.030 align:middle line:90%
So they differ by this product.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.630 align:middle line:84%
They differ by this product of
the external propagators, OK,

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.850 align:middle line:84%
so for each external momentum--
so here there's a propagator,

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.122 align:middle line:84%
and just as if
that-- when you get--

00:04:50.122 --> 00:04:53.830 align:middle line:84%
so this scattering amplitude
was corresponding to this one

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:84%
with all external
propagators stripped.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's why you
consider the truncated diagram

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.200 align:middle line:84%
not including the
external propagators.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.900 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.340 align:middle line:90%
And you take it on shell.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.890 align:middle line:90%


00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.640 align:middle line:84%
OK, and also, since
we are interested only

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.480 align:middle line:90%
in the process--

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.900 align:middle line:84%
which, all particles participate
in the scattering process--

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.585 align:middle line:84%
so we also only consider
the connected diagrams.

00:05:21.585 --> 00:05:24.600 align:middle line:90%


00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.240 align:middle line:84%
OK, consider the
connected diagrams.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this provides
a simplification,

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.490 align:middle line:84%
so you get fewer diagrams
and simpler expression

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.970 align:middle line:84%
than you would have got from
calculating these correlation

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.460 align:middle line:84%
functions, OK,
correlation functions.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.460 align:middle line:90%
So any questions on this?

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.590 align:middle line:90%


00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.183 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:05:52.183 --> 00:05:53.600 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So can
you explain again

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.890 align:middle line:84%
why this diagram, like,
you have one branch

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:57.890 align:middle line:90%
and then there's a loop?

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.360 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I will explain
that, but before that

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.220 align:middle line:90%
do you have other questions?

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.470 align:middle line:90%


00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.120 align:middle line:84%
So now I will
explain a few things.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:84%
OK, the first thing is
this sign convention,

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.813 align:middle line:90%
OK, this sign convention.

00:06:18.813 --> 00:06:25.920 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:34.980 align:middle line:84%
OK, so remember this
Gn, so let's go back

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.770 align:middle line:84%
to the definition of this
Gn, these momentum-space

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:38.970 align:middle line:90%
correlation functions.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.760 align:middle line:90%


00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So this is obtained by
doing a Fourier transform.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:90%


00:06:52.130 --> 00:07:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Say-- I think it
would be minus sign.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, by doing the
Fourier transform--

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:20.433 align:middle line:90%


00:07:20.433 --> 00:07:21.850 align:middle line:84%
yeah, by doing a
Fourier transform

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.972 align:middle line:84%
of your coordinate-space
correlation function,

00:07:24.972 --> 00:07:26.680 align:middle line:84%
the coordinate-space
correlation function

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.160 align:middle line:84%
can be written as
the following, OK,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.540 align:middle line:90%
so you have phi x1 and phi xn.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.020 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.520 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:42.110 align:middle line:90%


00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:52.530 align:middle line:84%
So now, for those to go
to the initial state,

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.090 align:middle line:84%
OK, for those to go
to initial state,

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:58.380 align:middle line:84%
we start from alpha
to beta, so then you

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.320 align:middle line:84%
want those phi corresponding
to the initial state

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.460 align:middle line:84%
to act on the right,
OK, to act on the right.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you do the Fourier
transform, OK, and then

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.940 align:middle line:90%
you do the Fourier transform.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.000 align:middle line:84%
So now let's just
consider one of them.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say
consider you have phi

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.040 align:middle line:84%
x for the initial state
acting on the right,

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.565 align:middle line:84%
and then you do a
Fourier transform.

00:08:18.565 --> 00:08:19.065 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:23.700 align:middle line:90%


00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.710 align:middle line:90%
OK, you do a Fourier transform.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And so this, if you just
record the mode expansion

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.860 align:middle line:84%
for phi and the phi
contains a and a dagger--

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.650 align:middle line:84%
and the a pieces acting on the
zero will just give you zero,

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.900 align:middle line:84%
so only a dagger
piece will survive.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.590 align:middle line:84%
OK, and the a dagger
piece is multiplied by--

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:56.870 align:middle line:84%
say you will have,
say, some k, and then

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:03.860 align:middle line:90%
have i omega k t plus minus.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:10.197 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, essentially-- yeah, let me
just write it in a simple way.

00:09:10.197 --> 00:09:11.530 align:middle line:90%
You just have exponential i k x.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.470 align:middle line:90%


00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:19.620 align:middle line:84%
OK, I think it's the exponential
minus i k x, so you just get

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.620 align:middle line:90%
the exponential minus i k x.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, with k it's the
on-shell momentum,

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.680 align:middle line:90%
so k is given by omega k and k.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.895 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:30.895 --> 00:09:33.200 align:middle line:84%
So when phi x
acting on the zero,

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.420 align:middle line:84%
you keep the part which is
corresponding to the a dagger,

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and then you get a piece
proportional like this.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:44.030 align:middle line:84%
OK, and now when you do
the Fourier transform

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:51.900 align:middle line:84%
and then you find just p, then
your p just equals to minus k.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.570 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's related
to the minus sign

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.850 align:middle line:84%
there, OK, related to
the minus sign there,

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:02.100 align:middle line:84%
and also, when your p equal
to minus k, then that means p0

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.960 align:middle line:90%
is equal to minus k.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.770 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's where that sign
in the initial state come from.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
with the final state,

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.930 align:middle line:84%
so for the final state, then
you need to look at the phi

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:17.850 align:middle line:84%
x acting on the left
to this, and then you

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.920 align:middle line:90%
do the Fourier transform.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.370 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.500 align:middle line:84%
You do the Fourier transform,
and then in this case,

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.500 align:middle line:90%
this becomes--

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.720 align:middle line:84%
on the left, it's the A
part acting on the left,

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.690 align:middle line:84%
so this gives you
k exponential i

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:42.710 align:middle line:84%
k x, OK, is the a
acting on the left.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And then when you do the
Fourier transform, then here it

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.350 align:middle line:90%
gives p equal to k.

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:51.460 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's why
in the final state,

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:55.690 align:middle line:84%
you just have p equal
to k, and then p0

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:57.625 align:middle line:90%
is equal to just omega k.

00:10:57.625 --> 00:11:01.290 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this explains the sign.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.050 align:middle line:90%
So this explains the sign.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.080 align:middle line:84%
It's just from whether you
act on the initial state

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.400 align:middle line:90%
or act on the final state.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:07.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:12.360 align:middle line:90%


00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.380 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.930 align:middle line:90%
So-- yes?

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.028 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Right, so
time-ordering of x1

00:11:17.028 --> 00:11:19.870 align:middle line:90%
to xn right here?

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:20.560 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.940 align:middle line:84%
It-- of course, when you derive
that, it matters, but here,

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.200 align:middle line:84%
for this argument,
it doesn't matter.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.200 align:middle line:90%
It just has to act to the right.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, for the initial state,
you have to act to the right.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, of course, to
derive that theorem,

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.991 align:middle line:90%
the time-order matters.

00:11:37.991 --> 00:11:38.491 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:42.640 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.277 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:11:43.277 --> 00:11:45.610 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So this was just
for free scalar field theory,

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.400 align:middle line:84%
that you showed
that this is true?

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.858 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: No, this is not for
the free scalar field theory.

00:11:49.858 --> 00:11:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's the-- here I just
detail you the sign convention.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, you can do this for the
full interacting theory.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just use the free
scalar as the-- yeah,

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.500 align:middle line:84%
because when you go to
plus or minus infinity,

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.470 align:middle line:84%
you can just reduce
to the free particles.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:14.380 align:middle line:90%


00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.630 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:20.540 align:middle line:90%


00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.350 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:23.900 align:middle line:90%
So this is the first comment.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:30.330 align:middle line:84%
The second comment, each
side, we need to here--

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:34.200 align:middle line:84%
from here, we need to truncate
the external propagator.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.740 align:middle line:84%
So we mentioned that if you
have a diagram like this,

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:45.348 align:middle line:84%
OK, if you have a diagram like
this, say minus P1, minus P2,

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:50.302 align:middle line:84%
to P3, P4, for a
diagram like this, OK,

00:12:50.302 --> 00:12:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and then the square root
and amplitude are just

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:57.150 align:middle line:84%
given by minus i lambda,
because you need to throw away

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:58.560 align:middle line:90%
all the external propagators.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.852 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to worry about
the external propagators.

00:13:00.852 --> 00:13:03.570 align:middle line:84%
OK, you just need to--
you have to truncate

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:08.590 align:middle line:84%
all the external propagators,
so that means you also

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:10.380 align:middle line:90%
throw away diagrams like this.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:18.770 align:middle line:90%


00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.230 align:middle line:84%
You can consider arbitrary,
complicated diagram,

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.830 align:middle line:84%
OK, as far as that
only happens--

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:25.640 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, here, it should--

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:32.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't draw very well, so this
just touch at the one point,

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:34.990 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.510 align:middle line:84%
So all these diagrams,
you can ignore them, OK,

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.660 align:middle line:84%
because they're just
corresponding to the correction

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.780 align:middle line:84%
to the external propagator,
OK, because they

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.870 align:middle line:90%
don't touch with the--

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:48.730 align:middle line:84%
they only-- yeah,
you can also-- yeah,

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.670 align:middle line:84%
you can do it on
any of them, OK?

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:53.500 align:middle line:84%
So such kind of
diagrams, they only

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.260 align:middle line:84%
change the external propagator,
but since we truncate

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.050 align:middle line:84%
the external
propagator, and then

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:02.470 align:middle line:84%
they don't matter at
all, OK, and it's all

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.590 align:middle line:90%
included in this diagram.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:05.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.090 align:middle line:90%
So the reason is the following.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:10.500 align:middle line:90%
The reason is the following.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:15.060 align:middle line:84%
All this diagram
do is just modify

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:18.450 align:middle line:84%
the properties of the
external propagator,

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:22.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, modify the properties
of the external propagator.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
all these diagrams

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.050 align:middle line:84%
can modify the
external propagators

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:32.630 align:middle line:84%
is to give you an
overall constant,

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:34.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's what this
Z is corresponding to.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So this Z essentially
just captures

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.540 align:middle line:84%
all these different
corrections, OK,

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.850 align:middle line:90%
all these different corrections.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And now you have
truncated them, and so you

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.350 align:middle line:90%
don't need to worry about them.

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:48.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So Z also has an expansion,
just 1 plus order lambda,

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.700 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, so the leading
order, so Z does not contribute.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.190 align:middle line:84%
OK, you can just set
it to 1, and when

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:03.730 align:middle line:84%
you go to the higher order, then
the Z can make a contribution.

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you just need
to separately take

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.310 align:middle line:84%
into account the Z, and
there's no need to contribute--

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.110 align:middle line:84%
to calculate those
things separately.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.872 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:15:11.872 --> 00:15:13.330 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: We also
truncate diagrams

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.725 align:middle line:84%
with loops in two
different legs?

00:15:15.725 --> 00:15:16.350 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, yeah, any of them,
you can do any number of--

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:23.190 align:middle line:84%
as far as they only
concern external legs,

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:26.310 align:middle line:84%
it's fine, yeah,
because this only--

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.370 align:middle line:84%
any of those corrections
only concerns one leg, yeah.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:30.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.890 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: But when calculating
the actual, let's say,

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.650 align:middle line:84%
n-point function, we
have-- we're supposed

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:35.550 align:middle line:90%
to include all of this?

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.450 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: That's right, yeah.

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:38.117 align:middle line:84%
When you calculate
the n-point function,

00:15:38.117 --> 00:15:40.215 align:middle line:84%
you have to include
all this, but when

00:15:40.215 --> 00:15:42.465 align:middle line:84%
you calculate scattering
amplitude, you don't need to.

00:15:42.465 --> 00:15:43.170 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Don't
need to, all right.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:44.040 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Because in the
scattering amplitude,

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.350 align:middle line:84%
you literally divide by
the external propagator,

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:50.940 align:middle line:90%
and all of these things, they--

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.930 align:middle line:84%
yeah, all these things,
essentially, they

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:56.880 align:middle line:90%
just modify the--

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.040 align:middle line:84%
give you the correction
to the external propagator

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.350 align:middle line:84%
and include it in
that constant Z, yeah.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:04.080 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So is Z
the same or different

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.870 align:middle line:90%
for different processes?

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.870 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, Z is the same.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:12.250 align:middle line:84%
No, Z is the same for
different processes,

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:14.320 align:middle line:84%
but it's different for
different particles.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.450 align:middle line:84%
So here we only have
one type of particles,

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:18.660 align:middle line:84%
so we only have
one Z. But if you

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.193 align:middle line:84%
have two kinds of
particles, then z

00:16:20.193 --> 00:16:21.735 align:middle line:84%
is different for
different particles.

00:16:21.735 --> 00:16:22.443 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:16:22.443 --> 00:16:26.490 align:middle line:84%
So for example, for, let's
say, a fixed process,

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:29.670 align:middle line:84%
let's say, like, 3 going
to 3, Z would be constant

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.230 align:middle line:84%
for all choices of
momentum, right?

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:32.010 align:middle line:90%
Am I correct to say that?

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:33.630 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah,
yeah, it's all-- yeah,

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:34.830 align:middle line:84%
a constant for
all of them, yeah.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:36.450 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: OK, yeah, because if
it depended on momentum, then

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:37.440 align:middle line:84%
it would be kind
of useless, right?

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.690 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: No, no, no, it
does not depend on momentum.

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:43.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, this just-- correct.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.010 align:middle line:84%
You see, all such things
don't change the momentum.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:48.330 align:middle line:90%
OK, the momentum don't change.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:49.750 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:50.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So we will not go
into details of the Z.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And that is in the
QFT2, and so we

00:16:56.650 --> 00:17:01.600 align:middle line:84%
will discuss how to
calculate this z in QFT2.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.530 align:middle line:84%
But the leading order,
they don't matter,

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:04.960 align:middle line:90%
and so we will start with 1.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.609 align:middle line:84%
So for our purpose,
actually, it's not important.

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:10.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.880 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is there a physical
interpretation for what

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.765 align:middle line:90%
interactions are included in Z?

00:17:14.765 --> 00:17:15.390 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this is the
self-interact-- yeah,

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.190 align:middle line:84%
just when the-- when you
have an interacting theory,

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:23.200 align:middle line:84%
so the particle can
interact with itself, when

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.325 align:middle line:84%
the particle
propagates, it actually

00:17:26.325 --> 00:17:27.950 align:middle line:84%
can interact with
the virtual particle.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:29.660 align:middle line:84%
It just all comes from
this kind of diagram.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.310 align:middle line:84%
You can have single
particle, and you

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:34.070 align:middle line:84%
can have such a diagram like
this and all these diagrams.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:39.410 align:middle line:90%


00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Correspondingly, you have
a particle propagating,

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:44.900 align:middle line:84%
but that particle can interact
with the virtual particle,

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.190 align:middle line:90%
its own virtual particle.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:50.100 align:middle line:84%
OK, and so the rule
corresponding to the particle

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.390 align:middle line:90%
loop, it's--

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.670 align:middle line:84%
so this is the real
external particle,

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.940 align:middle line:84%
but anything coming
in the loop, you

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:01.060 align:middle line:84%
can imagine how the virtual
particle which come out

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.820 align:middle line:84%
from the vacuum, and then
this can be interpreted

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.790 align:middle line:84%
as the particle interacting with
its own virtual particle, yes,

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.750 align:middle line:84%
a virtual particle
coming out from the back.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:09.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And so that, this
kind of interaction,

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.520 align:middle line:84%
will affect the property
of the propagation

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.740 align:middle line:84%
but can have the most
effect by prefactor,

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.050 align:middle line:84%
but actually can
change the mass, too.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:28.200 align:middle line:84%
But for the-- oh, it can
correct for the mass--

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.790 align:middle line:84%
and also, that's the
subject of the QFT2--

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.560 align:middle line:84%
can correct for
the mass, I think

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.171 align:middle line:84%
at most can change the
overall factor by z.

00:18:38.171 --> 00:18:42.890 align:middle line:90%


00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:43.760 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.420 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:47.920 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.220 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:48.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.320 align:middle line:90%


00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:51.850 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:54.230 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
other questions,

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:59.920 align:middle line:84%
so let's conclude our discussion
of chapter 3 on interacting

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.350 align:middle line:90%
theories.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.640 align:middle line:84%
So as I said before,
as I mentioned before,

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and now you are really
equipped with the technique,

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:14.530 align:middle line:84%
now in principle you can
treat any interacting theory.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:17.590 align:middle line:84%
So the technique, even though
we just used the scalar theory,

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.390 align:middle line:90%
but the technique is the same.

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:23.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, just for different theory,
you have different details, OK,

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.870 align:middle line:84%
and now you have
already equipped

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:29.710 align:middle line:84%
the foundation, the
basic tools for dealing

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.600 align:middle line:90%
with any interacting theory.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And for the goal
of this course, we

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.060 align:middle line:84%
want in the end to be able
to calculate the, say,

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:45.230 align:middle line:84%
interactions in quantum
electrodynamics, OK,

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:47.660 align:middle line:84%
and for that purpose,
we still need

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.600 align:middle line:90%
to have some other preparations.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.110 align:middle line:84%
So now let's discuss how
to describe fermions.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, and now we've
described the scalar

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:00.570 align:middle line:84%
and how the scalars
interact, and now we'll

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:01.530 align:middle line:90%
talk about fermions.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:08.700 align:middle line:90%


00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.080 align:middle line:84%
So let me say a
little bit of history.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.770 align:middle line:90%


00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:20.790 align:middle line:84%
So, soon after the
quantum mechanics

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:23.700 align:middle line:84%
was proposed by
Schrodinger and Heisenberg,

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:27.870 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, and then
people tried to generalize

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:29.530 align:middle line:90%
to relativistic situation--

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that came from this
Klein-Gordon equation,

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:35.490 align:middle line:84%
which we discussed
before, which in--

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:41.400 align:middle line:84%
this was the first attempt
to write down a wave equation

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.020 align:middle line:90%
for relativistic particles.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, and we discussed
before, this

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:49.980 align:middle line:84%
does not really make sense as a
relativistic quantum mechanics.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, yeah, but at the time,
this Klein-Gordon equation,

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.150 align:middle line:84%
if you interpret it as a
wave equation, suffers some--

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:03.740 align:middle line:90%
suffers from some difficulties.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:08.770 align:middle line:84%
One is that it does not
have a positive probability.

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:13.600 align:middle line:90%


00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.040 align:middle line:90%
You cannot define--

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:28.790 align:middle line:84%
I should say cannot define
positive definite probability.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:41.410 align:middle line:90%


00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And the second difficulty is
that it has negative energy

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:46.610 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:47.110 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:56.090 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.090 --> 00:22:00.200 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, of course,
as I mentioned before,

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.030 align:middle line:90%
that this was--

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:05.420 align:middle line:84%
there's more fundamental
reason that actually

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:09.390 align:middle line:84%
relativistic quantum
mechanics does not make sense,

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:12.710 align:middle line:84%
but at the time,
in the late 1920s,

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:14.300 align:middle line:90%
people didn't realize that.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.480 align:middle line:84%
OK, people just looked
at those difficulties,

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.410 align:middle line:84%
they thought it's a
technical difficulty.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So Dirac proceeded trying to
correct those difficulties,

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:25.040 align:middle line:90%
to overcome those difficulties.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.650 align:middle line:90%
OK, so Dirac then soon came up--

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:35.420 align:middle line:84%
so I think this is around
1926, and then 1928, then Dirac

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:41.590 align:middle line:84%
came up with this Dirac
theory, this Dirac equation.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:46.650 align:middle line:84%
OK, so Dirac equation was
aimed to cure those problems,

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:51.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, so Dirac concluded that
the Klein-Gordon equation,

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:54.960 align:middle line:84%
the reason it had
those problems was

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.640 align:middle line:84%
because the Klein-Gordon
equation has

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.740 align:middle line:90%
a second-order derivative.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, if
we have a first-order--

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.240 align:middle line:84%
have an equation with
first-order-- yeah,

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.365 align:middle line:84%
he speculated, if we
had the equation with

00:23:08.365 --> 00:23:10.740 align:middle line:84%
first-order-in-time derivative,
just like the Schrodinger

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:14.940 align:middle line:84%
equation, and then both problems
maybe can be solved, OK,

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:15.810 align:middle line:90%
can be solved.

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And then Dirac came up
with the Dirac equation.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:24.180 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out that
the Dirac equation

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:28.390 align:middle line:84%
solved the first problem,
OK, but didn't really solve

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:29.350 align:middle line:90%
the second problem.

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:34.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, but the level is, again,
due to more fundamental reasons,

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.570 align:middle line:84%
you cannot really interpret
the Dirac equation

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.695 align:middle line:84%
as a relativistic quantum
mechanics equation,

00:23:40.695 --> 00:23:42.820 align:middle line:84%
a wave equation for
relativistic quantum mechanics.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the Dirac
equation should be

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.720 align:middle line:90%
interpreted as a field theory.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So nowadays, we interpret this
this is the-- gives the field

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:59.710 align:middle line:90%
theory for--

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:07.960 align:middle line:90%


00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.300 align:middle line:84%
OK, so of course,
Dirac didn't know this,

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.900 align:middle line:84%
so essentially, he discovered
this beautiful theory

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.320 align:middle line:84%
for the wrong motivation,
OK, for the wrong motivation.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, this happens over
and over again in physics.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:24.850 align:middle line:90%
OK, people make great--

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:30.610 align:middle line:84%
made great discoveries often
for the wrong motivations.

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:33.920 align:middle line:84%
But the key is that if
you are good enough,

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.250 align:middle line:84%
you will find something
new and that something new

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:36.910 align:middle line:90%
will be useful.

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:44.410 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] OK, and this Dirac
theory is a prime example which

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:47.410 align:middle line:84%
is actually one of
the most beautiful--

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:50.740 align:middle line:84%
we will see, this is one of
the most beautiful equations

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.740 align:middle line:90%
in mathematical physics.

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but also, it's actually
describing electrons,

00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:00.810 align:middle line:84%
so it's not only beautiful,
but it's actually useful.

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:06.900 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this, first,
I'll talk about,

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:15.840 align:middle line:84%
introduce the Dirac equation,
OK, and its covariance.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:21.730 align:middle line:90%


00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:26.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the best way to
introduce the Dirac equation

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:30.850 align:middle line:84%
was still his
original motivation,

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:36.310 align:middle line:84%
is that we want to find the
first-order equation which

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:37.670 align:middle line:90%
is Lorentz invariant.

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:42.380 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the goal is that you
write down the equation,

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.110 align:middle line:84%
like a Schrodinger equation,
which is first-order-in-time

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:54.890 align:middle line:84%
derivative, OK, but
is Lorentz covariant.

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:59.350 align:middle line:90%


00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:01.990 align:middle line:90%
OK, but it's Lorentz covariant.

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:03.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:09.420 align:middle line:84%
So but Lorentz covariant
means that this equation

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.760 align:middle line:84%
has the same form when you
go to a different frame.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, yeah, that's
what we mean by--

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:18.060 align:middle line:84%
just when you go to a different
Lorentz frame, the equation,

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.340 align:middle line:84%
the form of the
equation looks the same.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Just different observers
in different laboratory,

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:25.200 align:middle line:84%
they see the same equation,
OK, so that's what

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.410 align:middle line:90%
we mean by Lorentz covariant.

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:32.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, so but for this to
be Lorentz covariant,

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:36.180 align:middle line:84%
remember, Lorentz
transformation transform t to x,

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:40.410 align:middle line:84%
so immediately,
you conclude that H

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:49.440 align:middle line:84%
must be first-order in
spatial derivatives.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:59.230 align:middle line:90%


00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:01.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:08.740 align:middle line:84%
So the only-- then the most
general way you can write it,

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:12.540 align:middle line:84%
so let's try to write
the most general--

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:13.170 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let's try to write
something like that.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.210 align:middle line:84%
So your first-order
derivative, then,

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:25.350 align:middle line:84%
has to have the following
form, alpha minus i--

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:30.390 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so this is the
gradient operator, yeah,

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:33.790 align:middle line:84%
spatial derivatives, and yeah,
that's i just for convenience.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And then this is a vector,
have three components,

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.580 align:middle line:84%
and then have to
contract with something,

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.140 align:middle line:90%
and then we include the alpha.

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And then you can at most add
the constant, OK, so let me just

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.100 align:middle line:84%
write this-- for
historical reasons,

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:49.150 align:middle line:84%
write this constant
as m times beta.

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:49.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:53.860 align:middle line:90%


00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:59.390 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
this equation form,

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:01.790 align:middle line:84%
you say this doesn't
make any sense, OK?

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:08.660 align:middle line:84%
So alpha and beta, they have to
be some kind of constant, OK,

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:12.000 align:middle line:84%
but if alpha and
beta are constant,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.520 align:middle line:84%
then this is not even a
rotational invariant, not

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.130 align:middle line:84%
to mention Lorentz
environment, OK,

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:23.980 align:middle line:84%
because this derivative is not
contracted by any other Lorentz

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:24.910 align:middle line:90%
indices.

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:26.590 align:middle line:84%
So alpha is just
some constant, OK,

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:39.430 align:middle line:84%
so this cannot be
Lorentz covariant,

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:47.750 align:middle line:84%
even cannot be rotational
environment, OK,

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:51.605 align:middle line:90%
if alpha or beta are constant.

00:28:51.605 --> 00:29:01.310 align:middle line:90%


00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:09.710 align:middle line:84%
OK, and psi is the
ordinary function.

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:18.953 align:middle line:90%


00:29:18.953 --> 00:29:19.453 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:19.453 --> 00:29:21.960 align:middle line:90%


00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:28.500 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, so you can have
alpha x, partial x, alpha

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.570 align:middle line:84%
y, partial y,
alpha z, partial z,

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:34.620 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you can easily convince
yourself, when you rotate xyz,

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:39.340 align:middle line:84%
this is not symmetric because
alpha is some constant.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm sure this idea
came to many people trying

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:47.500 align:middle line:84%
to look for some first-order
equation which are Lorentz

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:51.860 align:middle line:84%
covariant, then
after five minutes,

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.860 align:middle line:84%
you realize this
is not possible.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:58.730 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is just so simple,
it's just not possible.

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:00.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.870 align:middle line:90%
But then Dirac made it work.

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:06.747 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's really, say,
a stroke of genius.

00:30:06.747 --> 00:30:08.580 align:middle line:84%
It's really a stroke
of genius because there

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.700 align:middle line:90%
was nothing like this before.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Just even from a
mathematical point of view,

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.320 align:middle line:84%
it's purely, purely
imaginative, OK,

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.240 align:middle line:90%
just nothing like this before.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Like when Einstein wrote
down his theory, et cetera,

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:22.230 align:middle line:90%
you can still trace--

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:25.470 align:middle line:84%
there some clues,
OK, but when Dirac--

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:26.970 align:middle line:90%
this one just really--

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:28.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:31.950 align:middle line:84%
--like music, just came
out from his mind, OK?

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:37.050 align:middle line:84%
It just-- and then
he reasoned, OK,

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:40.890 align:middle line:84%
if this is constant
which does not work,

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:48.200 align:middle line:84%
and then let's make alpha
and beta to be matrices.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.660 align:middle line:90%


00:30:51.660 --> 00:31:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Take them-- OK,
and then, so let's

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.730 align:middle line:90%
say they are n-by-n matrices.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:07.930 align:middle line:90%


00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Then in order for that
equation to make sense,

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:14.320 align:middle line:84%
then psi has to be a
n-component vector.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:23.740 align:middle line:90%


00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:32.890 align:middle line:84%
So even for some people,
you come up with this idea,

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:34.390 align:middle line:84%
you will not imagine
this will work.

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:36.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, you just say, oh,
this will be a mess,

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.400 align:middle line:90%
but somehow, he made it work.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we will see
how to make this work.

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And so now if you want
H to be Hermitian,

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.530 align:middle line:84%
and then you can
immediately conclude--

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:54.530 align:middle line:84%
so that's why I put
the minus i thing here,

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:56.225 align:middle line:90%
is the alpha and the beta.

00:31:56.225 --> 00:31:58.820 align:middle line:90%


00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:03.320 align:middle line:84%
So m will just be some constant,
OK, and here is a matrix.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:06.350 align:middle line:84%
You can always take a
constant out, OK, so alpha,

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:08.345 align:middle line:90%
beta are Hermitian matrices.

00:32:08.345 --> 00:32:13.958 align:middle line:90%


00:32:13.958 --> 00:32:15.875 align:middle line:84%
They're just some constant
Hermitian matrices.

00:32:15.875 --> 00:32:21.630 align:middle line:90%


00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And then, so then he reasoned
that for this equation,

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:39.290 align:middle line:84%
if we want this equation
to be Lorentz covariant,

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:43.520 align:middle line:84%
then at least it should
have the relativistic plane

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.130 align:middle line:90%
wave as its solution.

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:48.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, if you have a covariant
equation, and at least

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.570 align:middle line:84%
you should have the relativistic
plane wave as its solution.

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:57.380 align:middle line:84%
If it does not even have that
type of solution, then you,

00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:59.660 align:middle line:84%
yeah, of course
cannot be covariant.

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:01.850 align:middle line:90%
OK, so the minimal requirement--

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:06.010 align:middle line:90%


00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:09.330 align:middle line:84%
so before we really try to
see how can we make this

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:12.810 align:middle line:84%
into a covariant equation,
we say let's consider

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:14.040 align:middle line:90%
minimal requirement.

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:20.950 align:middle line:90%


00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:24.285 align:middle line:84%
So we'd like to-- here, let
me call this equation star.

00:33:24.285 --> 00:33:31.030 align:middle line:90%


00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:47.962 align:middle line:84%
Star should have
plane wave solutions

00:33:47.962 --> 00:34:02.630 align:middle line:84%
with the standard relativistic
dispersion relation, OK?

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:13.159 align:middle line:90%


00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, these, you should have
p squared equal to minus m

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:16.850 align:middle line:90%
squared.

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:18.110 align:middle line:90%
OK, you have a plane wave.

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:20.989 align:middle line:84%
The plane wave will
be labeled by p,

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:22.460 align:middle line:84%
and then you should
have p squared

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.510 align:middle line:90%
equal to minus m squared.

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Then the m will be its
mass, OK, its mass.

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:34.239 align:middle line:84%
And to do this, the
simplest way to do this,

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:36.449 align:middle line:84%
so we know that the
Klein-Gordon equation--

00:34:36.449 --> 00:34:39.139 align:middle line:90%


00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:43.179 align:middle line:84%
so we know the Klein-Gordon
equation have such solutions.

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:46.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, Klein-Gordon equation
have such solutions.

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And then the simplest
way to do this is--

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:53.380 align:middle line:84%
this is the
first-order equation.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And now imagine if we
square this equation,

00:34:56.750 --> 00:35:00.200 align:middle line:84%
and then this should reduce
to the Klein-Gordon equation.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.320 align:middle line:84%
If you can make that
work, then this property

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.270 align:middle line:90%
will be satisfied, OK?

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:10.190 align:middle line:90%
So this will be satisfied--

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:17.450 align:middle line:84%
can be satisfied
if square of star,

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:28.375 align:middle line:84%
OK, satisfies reduced to
the Klein-Gordon equation.

00:35:28.375 --> 00:35:31.440 align:middle line:90%


00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.830 align:middle line:90%
OK, so now let's try to do this.

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:37.010 align:middle line:84%
So when we square
this star, we just

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:40.390 align:middle line:84%
act twice, so
essentially, you have--

00:35:40.390 --> 00:36:05.880 align:middle line:90%


00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.780 align:middle line:84%
so you have-- so when
you square that equation,

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:14.070 align:middle line:84%
then you just get partial
partial t square psi

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:16.710 align:middle line:90%
equal to H square psi.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:22.140 align:middle line:84%
OK, and then we try to make
this of this Klein-Gordon form.

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:29.070 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the right-hand side,
we just have the form minus i

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:38.820 align:middle line:84%
with alpha dot with this, and
then plus beta m square psi.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:45.410 align:middle line:84%
OK, we have these, and then
you can just expand this

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:50.015 align:middle line:84%
explicitly, so the right-hand
side, so then we have minus--

00:36:50.015 --> 00:36:53.100 align:middle line:90%


00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:59.130 align:middle line:84%
let's square this first-- then
you have minus alpha i alpha j.

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:00.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And then you have partial
partial xi partial partial xj

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.430 align:middle line:90%
psi, and then let's square this.

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:15.530 align:middle line:84%
Then you have beta
square m square psi,

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:18.230 align:middle line:90%
and then you have cross term.

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So cross term now has the form
beta alpha i plus alpha i beta.

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:28.250 align:middle line:84%
But now remember, beta and
alpha, they are not constant.

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:31.460 align:middle line:84%
They are matrices, OK, so they
don't necessarily commute.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:34.550 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be
careful about the orders.

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:40.730 align:middle line:84%
OK, and m partial
psi partial xi.

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:42.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the right-hand
side is just

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.120 align:middle line:90%
like this when you square it.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:50.030 align:middle line:90%


00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And now we wanted to look at
the Klein-Gordon equation.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:55.410 align:middle line:84%
The Klein-Gordon equation
has the following form.

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:58.980 align:middle line:90%
So now we want it to be--

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:07.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, hopefully to be given by
minus partial x square psi plus

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.280 align:middle line:90%
m square psi.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:12.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this one would be the
Klein-Gordon equation, OK,

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:14.420 align:middle line:90%
which we wrote before.

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:20.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, so by x-- yeah, here,
sorry, I should say xi square.

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:25.170 align:middle line:90%


00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:26.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:28.290 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:29.905 align:middle line:90%
So i should be summed, OK?

00:38:29.905 --> 00:38:35.680 align:middle line:90%


00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:39.970 align:middle line:84%
So now we want this equation,
so we want the right-hand side

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:42.440 align:middle line:90%
to be equal to this equation.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:46.220 align:middle line:84%
If that works, then we're
guaranteed to have a plane-wave

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:49.910 align:middle line:84%
solution of such a dispersion
relation because this equation

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:51.110 align:middle line:90%
has--

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:55.258 align:middle line:84%
OK, because this equation
has the plane-wave equation

00:38:55.258 --> 00:38:57.800 align:middle line:84%
with-- yeah, plane-wave solution
with that kind of dispersion

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.010 align:middle line:90%
relation.

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:03.290 align:middle line:84%
So now we just compare the
both sides, so for this

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:14.650 align:middle line:84%
to be true, so we
just need to have--

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:17.800 align:middle line:84%
so let's compare the
second-order derivative term.

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And then we need
alpha i, so we need--

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:27.300 align:middle line:90%


00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:33.530 align:middle line:84%
first, when i not equal to
j, the off-diagonal terms,

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:36.250 align:middle line:84%
they all should vanish,
OK, because here there's

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:37.840 align:middle line:90%
only diagonal terms.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:46.960 align:middle line:84%
So that means that the alpha
i alpha j plus alpha j alpha i

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.790 align:middle line:90%
should equal to 0.

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:51.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, remember, the
matrices, they don't

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.770 align:middle line:84%
commute, so we should be
careful about the ordering.

00:39:53.770 --> 00:40:04.380 align:middle line:84%
OK, so when i not equal to
j and when i equal to j,

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:06.360 align:middle line:84%
then you should
just reduce to here.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:11.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, and that means that
the alpha i square should

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:12.940 align:middle line:90%
equal to--

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:14.770 align:middle line:90%
and here you should just--

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:16.060 align:middle line:90%
here you should just--

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:20.200 align:middle line:84%
this term just will
give that, and the--

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.600 align:middle line:84%
should equal to beta
square equal to 1.

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.520 align:middle line:84%
OK, so here, there's
no summation, OK,

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.840 align:middle line:90%
no summation over i.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:31.280 align:middle line:90%


00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:37.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, so each alpha i
square has to be 0,

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:39.540 align:middle line:84%
and now we want this
linear term to be 0.

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:42.330 align:middle line:90%


00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And then you want beta alpha i
plus alpha i beta to be 0, OK?

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And also, just let
me put it together.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:02.360 align:middle line:84%
We said the alpha and the
beta, they must be Hermitian,

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:09.380 align:middle line:84%
so that means that the alpha
i dagger is equal to alpha i

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:12.590 align:middle line:84%
and the beta dagger
equal to beta.

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:17.030 align:middle line:90%


00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:21.900 align:middle line:84%
So if we satisfy all
these four conditions,

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:26.660 align:middle line:84%
and then we will guarantee
that that equation star should

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:28.070 align:middle line:90%
have the plane-wave solution.

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:32.190 align:middle line:84%
OK, that should have
the plane-wave solution.

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And so now you just
try to find matrices,

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.430 align:middle line:90%
satisfy those conditions.

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:42.450 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:46.065 align:middle line:84%
So we already said that the
1-by-1 matrix don't work,

00:41:46.065 --> 00:41:48.760 align:middle line:84%
that if they are constant,
of course, they don't work.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And so you can also
check 2-by-2 matrices.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.790 align:middle line:90%
It's not enough to do this.

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:57.530 align:middle line:90%
3-by-3 is not enough.

00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:00.830 align:middle line:84%
When you go to 4-by-4, then
you finally find the solutions.

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:03.300 align:middle line:84%
OK, you actually find the
infinite number of solutions.

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:15.920 align:middle line:84%
So you see that to satisfy them
needs at least a 4-by-4 matrix,

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.630 align:middle line:90%
so n has to be 4.

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:20.090 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this n has to be 4.

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:23.160 align:middle line:90%


00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And so let me give you
some possible solutions.

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:31.420 align:middle line:84%
So for example, here
is one solution.

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Say you take beta to be
1, so all matrices here

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:40.730 align:middle line:84%
should be understood
as 2-by-2 matrices,

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:47.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, so all together, it's
4-by-4 matrix, so 1 and minus 2.

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:49.480 align:middle line:84%
So beta's given by
this, so this is

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:58.000 align:middle line:84%
one solution, and alpha i given
by 0, sigma i, sigma i, 0.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And sigma are Pauli matrices,
OK, sigma i, Pauli matrices.

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:09.250 align:middle line:90%


00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:12.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is one solution
you can check yourself.

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:14.410 align:middle line:90%
OK, I will not do it here.

00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And this actually
is a solution that

00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:22.700 align:middle line:84%
satisfies all these
four conditions,

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:26.170 align:middle line:90%
and here is another solution.

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:30.180 align:middle line:84%
So now let me just save
time in not writing down

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:31.890 align:middle line:90%
this two-by-two.

00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:35.970 align:middle line:84%
So for example, beta
can be 0, 1, 1, 0.

00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:38.325 align:middle line:84%
OK, this one here is
a two-by-two matrix,

00:43:38.325 --> 00:43:48.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, and alpha i equal to
sigma i, 0, 0, minus sigma i.

00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:50.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:54.390 align:middle line:84%
So you can check both of them
satisfy those conditions.

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:55.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:58.710 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Sorry, so when you
have alpha times grad psi,

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:01.785 align:middle line:84%
is it-- do you act the
grad on each element of psi

00:44:01.785 --> 00:44:02.910 align:middle line:90%
and then multiply by alpha?

00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Or do you-- like, what's
the order of operations?

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:09.720 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Oh, it doesn't
matter because alpha is just

00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:12.144 align:middle line:90%
some constant, right?

00:44:12.144 --> 00:44:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Alpha and the grad, they
don't act on the same space.

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:19.290 align:middle line:84%
So that derivative just
acts on derivatives,

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and alpha acts on a
different component of psi.

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:26.230 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I see, but if
you took the grad of psi

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:28.360 align:middle line:84%
and then multiplied
by alpha, then you'd

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.285 align:middle line:90%
mix up the components of it.

00:44:30.285 --> 00:44:30.910 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:31.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's fine.

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:32.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can do it either
before-- yeah, they commute,

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:37.715 align:middle line:84%
so the operation of the alpha
and the operation of grad, they

00:44:37.715 --> 00:44:38.215 align:middle line:90%
commute.

00:44:38.215 --> 00:44:38.715 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:38.715 --> 00:44:41.180 align:middle line:90%


00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:42.165 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:44:42.165 --> 00:44:42.790 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:47.710 align:middle line:84%
So you'd have a-- so alpha
x because alpha x would just

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:52.980 align:middle line:84%
be the Pauli x matrices
times the grad x,

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:54.980 align:middle line:84%
and then you'd need another
one for y and for z?

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:55.605 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:44:55.605 --> 00:44:56.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:57.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:57.110 --> 00:45:01.310 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, so I urge you-- so
here I don't have time to write

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:03.720 align:middle line:90%
everything very explicitly.

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.710 align:middle line:84%
So here you just
write it as alpha

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:11.990 align:middle line:84%
x partial x plus alpha y partial
y plus alpha z partial z,

00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:13.820 align:middle line:90%
and each alpha is a matrix.

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And alpha acts on different
components of psi,

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:21.200 align:middle line:84%
and this just acts on--
the derivative acts

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.492 align:middle line:90%
on all components of psi.

00:45:23.492 --> 00:45:25.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.110 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:28.280 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:34.540 align:middle line:84%
So now, good, you say we have an
equation, OK, so far, so psi--

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:51.310 align:middle line:90%


00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:54.360 align:middle line:90%
so alpha is a 4-by-4 matrix.

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, alpha and beta
are 4-by-4 matrices,

00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:02.600 align:middle line:84%
so that means that psi should
be a four-component vector.

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:11.430 align:middle line:90%


00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:16.680 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's a four-component
vector, OK, so we will take--

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.740 align:middle line:84%
so we will denote
it as psi alpha.

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:27.962 align:middle line:84%
So alpha equal to 1,
2, 3, 4, OK, and we--

00:46:27.962 --> 00:46:30.420 align:middle line:84%
for the moment, let's just take
the most general situation.

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:35.760 align:middle line:84%
We'll take alpha to be complex,
OK, each of them to be complex.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:43.365 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is alpha, like,
a vector of matrices?

00:46:43.365 --> 00:46:43.990 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:46.545 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Which element
of alpha is a matrix?

00:46:46.545 --> 00:46:47.670 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: What do you mean?

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:49.337 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So, like,
alpha i is a matrix.

00:46:49.337 --> 00:46:52.650 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, alpha 1, alpha
2, alpha 3, they are all--

00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:54.000 align:middle line:90%
they are three matrices.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:00.700 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: And you said we'd
need the first on the list.

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't we want each
alpha i to be diagonal?

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you're saying,
that each matrix in alpha

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:07.807 align:middle line:90%
should be a diagonal matrix?

00:47:07.807 --> 00:47:08.348 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: No.

00:47:08.348 --> 00:47:09.490 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:14.180 align:middle line:84%
No, alpha, no, we don't know
the form of the alpha, right?

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:17.480 align:middle line:84%
No, alpha are just
matrices, so this

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:20.840 align:middle line:84%
means that alpha 1 alpha
2 plus alpha 2 alpha 1,

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:24.350 align:middle line:84%
as a matrix product,
should give you zero.

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:26.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.565 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, alpha itself is a matrix.

00:47:27.565 --> 00:47:33.870 align:middle line:90%


00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:35.030 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Of matrices.

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.572 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Hm?

00:47:35.572 --> 00:47:36.893 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Of matrices.

00:47:36.893 --> 00:47:37.560 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:38.910 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Each alpha i--

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:41.700 align:middle line:84%
each component of
alpha is a matrix.

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:42.200 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:42.825 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:47:42.825 --> 00:47:43.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:45.115 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just, alpha
have three components.

00:47:45.115 --> 00:47:45.782 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:47:45.782 --> 00:47:48.365 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: And each
component is a matrix.

00:47:48.365 --> 00:47:49.490 align:middle line:90%
Each component is a matrix.

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Just, if you have alpha
1, alpha 2, alpha 3,

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:55.100 align:middle line:84%
so here, here you see
explicitly, alpha 1

00:47:55.100 --> 00:48:00.140 align:middle line:84%
is equal to sigma 1, sigma 1,
alpha 2 is sigma 2, sigma 2,

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:02.910 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:05.090 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:08.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, yeah, at the beginning,
this may a little bit more--

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:12.580 align:middle line:84%
not very intuitive, OK, but
if you just work through it,

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.407 align:middle line:84%
then you will get a
feeling about it, OK,

00:48:14.407 --> 00:48:15.740 align:middle line:90%
you will get a feeling about it.

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:17.800 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I say
this was really genius,

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.560 align:middle line:84%
because just nobody could
have thought of this.

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:24.370 align:middle line:90%
OK, it just came from nowhere.

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:25.960 align:middle line:90%
Really, there was no clue, OK?

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:30.190 align:middle line:84%
There was no clue
of such a structure.

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:31.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:38.200 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is a new object,
so we call it spinor.

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, we call it
spinor because it--

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:44.350 align:middle line:84%
later we will see that this
describes spin-half particles,

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:45.830 align:middle line:90%
so that's why we call it spinor.

00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:46.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:51.290 align:middle line:90%


00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:52.600 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:53.380 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Dr. Liu?

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:54.040 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah?

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.040 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So if we
take n to be larger,

00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.420 align:middle line:90%
then we describe all the spins?

00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:00.235 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Hm?

00:49:00.235 --> 00:49:03.860 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: If we take a n by n
matrix where n is not so small,

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:05.080 align:middle line:90%
then we can use that --?

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:06.970 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: No, you get--

00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:10.720 align:middle line:84%
just we are not using those
matrices in the efficient way.

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:14.045 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this become--
you can reduce always--

00:49:14.045 --> 00:49:15.420 align:middle line:84%
yeah, just from
physical purpose,

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:17.840 align:middle line:84%
you can always
reduce it to 4, yeah.

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:20.420 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Well, what if
I wanted a wave equation

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:22.567 align:middle line:90%
for higher spin?

00:49:22.567 --> 00:49:23.650 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: For higher spin?

00:49:23.650 --> 00:49:25.210 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, like 3/2 or 5/2.

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:25.835 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:49:25.835 --> 00:49:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, if you know how
to do the two halves,

00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:29.470 align:middle line:90%
then you can generalize.

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:30.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so one half,
essentially, you

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:36.150 align:middle line:84%
can-- yeah, based on one
half, you can generalize it.

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:38.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:39.110 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:39.860 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yes?

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:42.590 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Just to
clarify, so alpha i,

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:46.490 align:middle line:84%
is it a 2-by-2 matrix
of 2-by-2 matrices?

00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:48.492 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just a 4-by-4
matrix and that's just

00:49:48.492 --> 00:49:49.700 align:middle line:90%
a convenient way to write it?

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:51.433 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, this
is a 4-by-4 matrix.

00:49:51.433 --> 00:49:53.850 align:middle line:84%
It's just a convenient way to
write these 4-by-4 matrices.

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:54.160 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:54.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:58.790 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: So that I don't have
to write all four components.

00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:59.520 align:middle line:90%
I just-- yeah.

00:49:59.520 --> 00:49:59.810 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:00.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:02.750 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: So I divided
these 4-by-4 matrices

00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:06.338 align:middle line:84%
into four 2-by-2 blocks, and
then I specify each block.

00:50:06.338 --> 00:50:07.880 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's
just blocks, not

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:08.945 align:middle line:90%
matrices in the matrix.

00:50:08.945 --> 00:50:09.820 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:13.490 align:middle line:84%
No, no, just the blocks of
that 4-by-4 matrix, yeah,

00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:18.080 align:middle line:84%
separate the single 4-by-4
matrix into four 2-by-2 blocks.

00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:19.420 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:21.520 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: OK?

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:22.020 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:26.380 align:middle line:90%


00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:30.100 align:middle line:84%
OK, so for later
convenience, let's introduce

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:32.290 align:middle line:90%
a slightly different notation.

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:35.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we have
this equation,

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.615 align:middle line:90%
so now we have the form of this.

00:50:37.615 --> 00:50:40.470 align:middle line:90%


00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So now we have the
form of this partial t

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:56.840 align:middle line:84%
psi equal to minus alpha
plus beta m psi, so now

00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:01.040 align:middle line:84%
let's multiply both
sides by a factor--

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:01.720 align:middle line:90%
by beta.

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:06.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, so beta is a matrix, OK,
so this is a matrix equation.

00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:08.510 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is a
matrix equation.

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's multiply both
sides by beta, OK,

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:22.010 align:middle line:84%
and then we get i beta partial t
psi equal to minus i beta times

00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:22.510 align:middle line:90%
alpha.

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:27.500 align:middle line:90%


00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and let me just
write it maybe this way,

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:42.120 align:middle line:84%
so alpha i and partial xi
psi, OK, then plus m psi.

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:44.880 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you'd get an
equation like this.

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:47.400 align:middle line:90%


00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:48.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:54.470 align:middle line:90%
So now I will denote--

00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:59.970 align:middle line:84%
introduce a new notation
so that it looks nicer.

00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:02.610 align:middle line:84%
I'll denote the
gamma 0 equal to i

00:52:02.610 --> 00:52:13.870 align:middle line:84%
beta and then the gamma i
equal to i times beta alpha i.

00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:17.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, and then let's all
pull it to the same side,

00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and then this becomes
the following equation,

00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:23.810 align:middle line:84%
then the equation has the
following form, gamma mu

00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:28.710 align:middle line:84%
partial mu minus
m psi equal to 0.

00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:31.940 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is the form
of our Dirac equation.

00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:37.850 align:middle line:90%


00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:43.690 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this becomes
gamma 0 times partial t,

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:47.480 align:middle line:84%
so this becomes gamma
i times partial xi.

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:51.160 align:middle line:84%
When they come together, then
become gamma mu partial mu,

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and then m will move
to the other side.

00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:55.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:55.780 --> 00:53:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So due to different
conventions of the Minkowski

00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:04.780 align:middle line:84%
metric signature you use, et
cetera, so different books

00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:08.990 align:middle line:84%
or different places, you will
see i in different places.

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:10.780 align:middle line:90%
Some equations have i--

00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:12.430 align:middle line:90%
yeah, some books have i here.

00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:14.710 align:middle line:90%
Some books have i here.

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:16.855 align:middle line:90%
In my version, there's no i, OK?

00:53:16.855 --> 00:53:17.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I know this is
annoying, but yeah,

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:24.530 align:middle line:90%
but this is just a fact of life.

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:25.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I find
that this version

00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:30.430 align:middle line:84%
is most simplest in
terms of notation

00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:33.340 align:middle line:84%
anyway, so that's the
convention we use.

00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:36.810 align:middle line:90%


00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:39.010 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:41.510 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:44.360 align:middle line:84%
So now, again, this
is a matrix equation.

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Now let me just write it
in the component form,

00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:50.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is in
the component form.

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:54.180 align:middle line:90%
I have gamma mu, which--

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:58.080 align:middle line:84%
each of them is a matrix,
alpha, beta, so alpha and beta,

00:53:58.080 --> 00:53:58.980 align:middle line:90%
they're always run.

00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:01.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, sorry for this.

00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Now the alpha, beta
just means the--

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:09.910 align:middle line:84%
yeah, means the indices,
OK, not the matrices.

00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:11.970 align:middle line:90%
So alpha and the beta--

00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:15.420 align:middle line:84%
actually, convention is
to write this like that.

00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:16.980 align:middle line:90%
OK, it doesn't matter.

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:25.400 align:middle line:84%
So partial mu psi beta minus
m psi alpha equal to 0, OK,

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:28.160 align:middle line:90%
so this is a matrix equation.

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:30.150 align:middle line:84%
There are all together
four equations,

00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:35.180 align:middle line:84%
so the beta is summed
because beta is repeated.

00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:40.460 align:middle line:84%
So beta is summed,
and then, yeah,

00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:42.770 align:middle line:90%
and the mu is also summed.

00:54:42.770 --> 00:54:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So this is a little
bit intricate equation.

00:54:44.810 --> 00:54:46.768 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is a little
bit intricate equation,

00:54:46.768 --> 00:54:51.280 align:middle line:84%
but once you get used to it,
it's not that difficult. Yes?

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:53.280 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: There's no
meaning to the upstairsness

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:56.553 align:middle line:84%
or downstairsness of
alpha and beta, right?

00:54:56.553 --> 00:54:58.470 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: There's a
meaning of upstairs, yeah,

00:54:58.470 --> 00:55:03.790 align:middle line:84%
because these two index
are not symmetric,

00:55:03.790 --> 00:55:07.350 align:middle line:84%
so it's easier to put one
upstairs, one downstairs.

00:55:07.350 --> 00:55:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, these two indices
are not symmetric.

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:12.520 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:17.360 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it takes a little bit
time to get used to it, OK,

00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:22.250 align:middle line:84%
and I know some people
develop psychological fears

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:26.510 align:middle line:84%
for fermions because you have to
deal with those gamma matrices,

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:28.850 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:31.280 align:middle line:84%
For a long while, actually, I
have this psychological fear

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:31.780 align:middle line:90%
myself.

00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:32.850 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:35.780 align:middle line:84%
When I look at fermions,
I want to be away from it

00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:38.330 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want to deal
with those gamma matrices,

00:55:38.330 --> 00:55:43.370 align:middle line:84%
but these are beautiful objects
if you get used to them.

00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:46.220 align:middle line:90%


00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:50.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now those
conditions, you can also

00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:54.200 align:middle line:84%
write them in the compact
way in terms of the gamma--

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.150 align:middle line:90%
in terms of gamma matrices.

00:55:56.150 --> 00:56:02.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, so 1, 2, 3 now
can be written as--

00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:07.010 align:middle line:84%
in terms of gamma
matrices gamma mu gamma

00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:10.620 align:middle line:90%
nu plus gamma nu gamma mu.

00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:18.980 align:middle line:84%
So mu nu is always from 0 to 3,
OK, equal to 0, or mu not equal

00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:25.180 align:middle line:84%
to nu, and then gamma 0
squared is equal to minus 1.

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:28.150 align:middle line:84%
It's because this
gamma 0 is i beta,

00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:30.100 align:middle line:84%
and the beta squared
is equal to 1.

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And then the gamma i square,
so there's no summation over i

00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:38.480 align:middle line:84%
here, OK, because each matrix
gamma i square equal to 1.

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:38.980 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:41.690 align:middle line:90%


00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:47.107 align:middle line:84%
And you can write this further
in a more compact form.

00:56:47.107 --> 00:56:49.190 align:middle line:84%
You can write this further
in a more compact form.

00:56:49.190 --> 00:57:09.380 align:middle line:90%


00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:14.050 align:middle line:84%
So you can write this
more compactly as gamma mu

00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:19.450 align:middle line:84%
gamma nu anticommutator
equal to 2 eta mu nu.

00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So anti-commutator
just means that if you

00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:28.990 align:middle line:84%
have objects, two objects, curly
bracket means a b plus b a, OK?

00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:31.615 align:middle line:90%
So this is the key equation.

00:57:31.615 --> 00:57:34.300 align:middle line:90%


00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:36.580 align:middle line:84%
OK, so all the gamma
matrices, so you

00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:42.850 align:middle line:84%
can check yourself, OK, all
these are given by just this.

00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:46.280 align:middle line:84%
You can easily see, when mu
not equal to nu, of course,

00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.430 align:middle line:84%
the right-hand side
is 0, so that just

00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:50.320 align:middle line:90%
is equal to that equation.

00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:54.940 align:middle line:84%
When mu equal to nu, when
there is-- when they're both 0,

00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:56.680 align:middle line:90%
then this gives you minus 1.

00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.080 align:middle line:84%
That's corresponding
to the gamma 0 case,

00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:03.081 align:middle line:84%
and then when they're ij,
then corresponding to gamma x.

00:58:03.081 --> 00:58:03.581 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:58:03.581 --> 00:58:06.738 align:middle line:90%


00:58:06.738 --> 00:58:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And so this equation, when
the later mathematicians,

00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:13.680 align:middle line:84%
of course, studied
this, a mathematician

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:15.930 align:middle line:84%
would say this is
a beautiful object.

00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And then they studied
this, so now it's

00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:19.065 align:middle line:90%
called Clifford algebra.

00:58:19.065 --> 00:58:21.600 align:middle line:90%


00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:24.135 align:middle line:84%
So this object is
called Clifford algebra.

00:58:24.135 --> 00:58:27.645 align:middle line:90%


00:58:27.645 --> 00:58:29.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:58:29.970 --> 00:58:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And so then any
sets of gamma mu--

00:58:38.370 --> 00:58:45.540 align:middle line:84%
so gamma mu are a set of
four matrices satisfying this

00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:47.920 align:middle line:90%
equation--

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:51.280 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let me call this star--

00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:53.800 align:middle line:90%


00:58:53.800 --> 00:59:07.340 align:middle line:84%
is called a representation
of the algebra,

00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:10.820 align:middle line:90%
of the Clifford algebra.

00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:11.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:17.970 align:middle line:90%


00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:20.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:30.720 align:middle line:84%
So from these two solutions
of alpha and beta,

00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:32.940 align:middle line:84%
we can easily-- from
here, we can work out

00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:40.740 align:middle line:84%
what is the gamma nu and
the gamma i, so yeah,

00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:44.400 align:middle line:90%
so here are two examples.

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Also, yeah, before-- talking
about examples, also,

00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:59.580 align:middle line:84%
from number 4, you also
find that the gamma 0

00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:03.810 align:middle line:84%
dagger equal to minus
gamma 0, and gamma--

01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:09.180 align:middle line:84%
so gamma 0 is anti-Hermitian
and the gamma i is Hermitian.

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:10.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And you can also write
this together in the more--

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:21.690 align:middle line:84%
or equivalently write it
as gamma mu dagger gamma

01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:24.120 align:middle line:90%
0 gamma mu gamma 0.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:28.330 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you can check that
this equation is the same

01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:29.490 align:middle line:90%
as these two equations.

01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:32.245 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:00:32.245 --> 01:00:32.745 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:00:32.745 --> 01:00:34.530 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Do these
representations

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:38.520 align:middle line:84%
generate a certain
transformation?

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.640 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:43.140 align:middle line:84%
I will talk about things related
to this a little bit later.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:43.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:47.880 align:middle line:90%


01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:48.870 align:middle line:90%
Good?

01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And then we can write
down explicit solutions

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:54.360 align:middle line:84%
for those gammas, so
that's two representations.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.060 align:middle line:84%
From those solutions
of beta and alpha,

01:00:57.060 --> 01:01:01.030 align:middle line:84%
we can write down different
solutions of gamma.

01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:08.650 align:middle line:84%
So for example, for 1, you're
corresponding to gamma 0 equal

01:01:08.650 --> 01:01:10.330 align:middle line:90%
to minus i.

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:16.420 align:middle line:84%
So now this is minus i times a
2-by-2 matrix, OK, or i, 0, 0,

01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:24.660 align:middle line:84%
minus i, OK, and the gamma i
is equal to 0, minus sigma i,

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:29.250 align:middle line:90%
minus i sigma i, 0.

01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And the second solution
there corresponding

01:01:31.170 --> 01:01:42.040 align:middle line:84%
to gamma 0 equal to 0, i, i, 0,
and then gamma i equal to 0--

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:45.200 align:middle line:90%


01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:52.170 align:middle line:84%
I think it's also minus
i sigma i, i sigma i, 0.

01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:52.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:56.880 align:middle line:90%


01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Good, so these are just--
again, these are just good--

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:02.070 align:middle line:84%
so these are two
different representations

01:02:02.070 --> 01:02:03.316 align:middle line:90%
of this algebra.

01:02:03.316 --> 01:02:03.816 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:02:03.816 --> 01:02:06.990 align:middle line:90%


01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:08.940 align:middle line:90%
So now let me make some remarks.

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:11.530 align:middle line:84%
So before I proceed further,
do you have questions?

01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:13.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:02:13.290 --> 01:02:16.950 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: For 2, shouldn't
the Pauli matrices be--

01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:17.689 align:middle line:90%
oh, nevermind.

01:02:17.689 --> 01:02:18.231 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Oh.

01:02:18.231 --> 01:02:21.530 align:middle line:90%


01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:24.450 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:25.257 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:02:25.257 --> 01:02:27.090 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So I guess
that I don't understand

01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:30.510 align:middle line:84%
what space this side
vector, the four entries--

01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:31.680 align:middle line:90%
like, what is that?

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Is this a Lorentz four-vector?

01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:35.390 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: No, it's not
a Lorentz four-vector.

01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:36.570 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So in what
sense is it a vector?

01:02:36.570 --> 01:02:37.560 align:middle line:90%
How does it transform?

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.185 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, so
this is a new space.

01:02:39.185 --> 01:02:40.390 align:middle line:90%
We will talk about that.

01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this is a
new space, and so

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:48.530 align:middle line:84%
that's called-- this is
called spinor space, yeah.

01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:49.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:51.050 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: How do we know
that-- are these the only two

01:02:51.050 --> 01:02:51.830 align:middle line:90%
representations?

01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:52.415 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Oh, no, no, no.

01:02:52.415 --> 01:02:53.870 align:middle line:84%
There are infinite
number of them.

01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mentioned there
are infinite number

01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:58.970 align:middle line:84%
of such solutions, and
this is just two of them.

01:02:58.970 --> 01:03:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I will comment on all
those different solutions.

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:06.710 align:middle line:90%


01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:07.210 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:07.710 align:middle line:90%
Good?

01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:14.240 align:middle line:90%


01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:20.635 align:middle line:90%
So now let me make some remarks.

01:03:20.635 --> 01:03:28.350 align:middle line:90%


01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:39.300 align:middle line:84%
OK, so first, if you consider
the case m equal to 0,

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:43.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, if you can see the case m
equal to 0, and then this is,

01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:49.410 align:middle line:84%
like, for massless, so
when m equal to zero, then

01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:51.870 align:middle line:84%
when you reduce to this
Klein-Gordon equation, what you

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:53.340 align:middle line:90%
get is the massless equation.

01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:54.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:59.010 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's a massless
equation, and then you

01:03:59.010 --> 01:04:04.140 align:middle line:84%
will have dispersion relation
p squared equal to 0.

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:09.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, so in this case,
the original equation

01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:13.960 align:middle line:84%
just becomes partial t
equal to minus i alpha

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:17.860 align:middle line:90%
i partial partial xi psi.

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:19.570 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's your equation.

01:04:19.570 --> 01:04:23.140 align:middle line:90%
There's no this m beta term.

01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:24.220 align:middle line:90%
There's no m beta term.

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:27.060 align:middle line:90%


01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:30.100 align:middle line:90%
So in this case, you just--

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:33.950 align:middle line:84%
the same story just here,
you just forget about beta.

01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:35.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, the same story,
you forget the beta,

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and then you only
need alpha i alpha

01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:49.060 align:middle line:84%
j the commutator to be 0 for
i not equal to j, essentially

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:51.310 align:middle line:90%
just that equation 1 there.

01:04:51.310 --> 01:04:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And then also, you'd want the
alpha i square equal to 1, OK,

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.240 align:middle line:90%
so for any i.

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:05.990 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now these are the
conditions for the alphas,

01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and now you can actually
satisfy by 2-by-2 matrices.

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:12.523 align:middle line:84%
So what matrix satisfies
this kind of relation?

01:05:12.523 --> 01:05:13.190 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Pauli.

01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:16.490 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Yeah, so
the Pauli matrices

01:05:16.490 --> 01:05:19.940 align:middle line:84%
anticommute among themselves,
and their square is equal to 1.

01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So you can just take off i
in order to simplify here.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:29.630 align:middle line:84%
So this tells you something
important, tells you actually

01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:31.610 align:middle line:84%
the equation for a
massless particle

01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and a massive particle
are very different.

01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So massive particle,
you actually need

01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:40.270 align:middle line:84%
the four components,
but for the massive--

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:43.810 align:middle line:84%
but for the massless
particle, you

01:05:43.810 --> 01:05:47.080 align:middle line:84%
can describe by a sigma
matrix here, only 2 by 2.

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:58.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that means
for massless psi,

01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:12.520 align:middle line:84%
it can be described using
a two-component vector,

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:20.400 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that in this case,
psi equal to psi 1 and psi 2.

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Again, they are
all just complex.

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:24.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:48.720 align:middle line:90%


01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:49.220 align:middle line:90%
Good?

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So this actually-- yeah, we
will elaborate on this later.

01:06:56.660 --> 01:07:00.610 align:middle line:84%
So this actually tells you that
actually the massive particle

01:07:00.610 --> 01:07:02.980 align:middle line:84%
have more degrees of freedom
than the massless particle,

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:08.030 align:middle line:84%
OK, more degrees than
the massless particle.

01:07:08.030 --> 01:07:09.650 align:middle line:90%
Good?

01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And then the second thing is
what Dirac essentially was--

01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:22.070 align:middle line:90%
Dirac's original motivation.

01:07:22.070 --> 01:07:31.080 align:middle line:84%
So from Dirac equation, you can
show you can derive a current.

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Just as you can do for
the Schrodinger equation,

01:07:35.550 --> 01:07:40.210 align:middle line:84%
you can derive an equation
like this for some j mu

01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:46.990 align:middle line:84%
and with j 0, with the 0-th
component of this thing,

01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:57.050 align:middle line:90%
positive definite classically.

01:07:57.050 --> 01:07:59.790 align:middle line:90%


01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:01.500 align:middle line:84%
So I emphasize that
this is classically.

01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:03.360 align:middle line:84%
You will-- later,
you will see why, OK?

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:08.640 align:middle line:90%


01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And this, I will
leave it to your pset,

01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:16.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is very
similar to the derivation

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:18.840 align:middle line:84%
of such occurrence in
the case of the just

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:20.399 align:middle line:84%
non-relativistic
Schrodinger equation

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:22.770 align:middle line:84%
because this has
the same structure.

01:08:22.770 --> 01:08:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the Dirac equation,
when we start it,

01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:27.870 align:middle line:84%
has the structure of the
non-relativistic Schrodinger

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:32.130 align:middle line:84%
equation, and yeah, so
you can show something

01:08:32.130 --> 01:08:32.970 align:middle line:90%
like this exists.

01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:35.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:08:35.130 --> 01:08:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And then the third point
is related to the question

01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:39.839 align:middle line:90%
many of you may have.

01:08:39.839 --> 01:08:42.450 align:middle line:90%


01:08:42.450 --> 01:08:45.830 align:middle line:84%
So we said, what's
the meaning of all

01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:49.160 align:middle line:84%
these different
solutions for alpha

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:51.470 align:middle line:90%
and beta or for gammas, OK?

01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:54.484 align:middle line:84%
So as I mentioned, you can have
infinite number of solutions.

01:08:54.484 --> 01:08:55.609 align:middle line:90%
What's the meaning of them?

01:08:55.609 --> 01:08:58.450 align:middle line:90%


01:08:58.450 --> 01:09:06.090 align:middle line:84%
So first, let's imagine when
we look at this equation--

01:09:06.090 --> 01:09:10.609 align:middle line:84%
so as I said, this
is a matrix equation,

01:09:10.609 --> 01:09:12.880 align:middle line:84%
so in this matrix
equation, then you

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:16.450 align:middle line:84%
have this psi which is a
four-component vector, OK,

01:09:16.450 --> 01:09:18.890 align:middle line:90%
some four-component vector.

01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:21.970 align:middle line:84%
So now let's imagine
we make a basis change

01:09:21.970 --> 01:09:29.260 align:middle line:84%
in this four-component vector,
OK, so imagine, just say,

01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:43.390 align:middle line:84%
consider making a
basis change in psi.

01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:46.120 align:middle line:90%


01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:50.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, so a basis change in psi
just means, in linear algebra,

01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:55.460 align:middle line:84%
this is a vector, means we
consider another psi prime,

01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:59.900 align:middle line:84%
which is-- so we take psi
to some other psi prime

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:04.210 align:middle line:84%
which is related to psi
by invertible matrix, so

01:10:04.210 --> 01:10:16.700 align:middle line:84%
B, just some constant,
complex, invertible matrix.

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:22.270 align:middle line:84%
OK, so essentially, you just
make a linear superposition

01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:23.270 align:middle line:90%
of different components.

01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:31.190 align:middle line:84%
OK, so yeah, so
this corresponding

01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:32.135 align:middle line:90%
to a basis change.

01:10:32.135 --> 01:10:34.720 align:middle line:90%


01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:40.900 align:middle line:84%
So now if psi satisfies
this equation,

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:44.300 align:middle line:84%
psi satisfies this equation,
you can easily convince yourself

01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:54.110 align:middle line:84%
that the psi prime satisfies
the following equation,

01:10:54.110 --> 01:11:02.710 align:middle line:84%
the gamma mu prime partial mu
minus m psi prime equal to 0,

01:11:02.710 --> 01:11:10.850 align:middle line:84%
and the gamma mu prime is
equal to B gamma mu B minus 1.

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:11.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:18.560 align:middle line:90%


01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.990 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, so this
easily can be shown.

01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:23.570 align:middle line:90%
You just multiply B from both--

01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:26.570 align:middle line:84%
just multiply B
to this equation,

01:11:26.570 --> 01:11:29.270 align:middle line:84%
OK, multiply B to this
equation, and for this term,

01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:32.630 align:middle line:84%
you can just directly give--
psi gives you psi prime.

01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And for this term, then
you just get the B,

01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:38.120 align:middle line:84%
and then here you can
insert B minus 1, B,

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.680 align:middle line:90%
and then, yeah, you get that.

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:43.580 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this, you can easily
convince yourself, just

01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:46.350 align:middle line:90%
a couple of lines.

01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So now, so psi prime satisfies
essentially the same equation

01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:57.280 align:middle line:84%
but a different gamma
matrix, OK, a gamma mu prime,

01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.325 align:middle line:84%
so now you can easily
check yourself, OK?

01:11:59.325 --> 01:12:09.100 align:middle line:90%


01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So you can easily check yourself
this gamma mu prime also

01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:13.570 align:middle line:90%
satisfies that algebra.

01:12:13.570 --> 01:12:15.865 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you can easily
check yourself.

01:12:15.865 --> 01:12:50.590 align:middle line:90%


01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:57.400 align:middle line:84%
So then we conclude,
any sets, since we

01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:00.850 align:middle line:84%
can make a basis transformation
as you want, OK, that the--

01:13:00.850 --> 01:13:03.850 align:middle line:84%
except the basis transformation
should not change physics, OK?

01:13:03.850 --> 01:13:30.820 align:middle line:84%
So any sets of gamma mu related
by a similarity transformation

01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:31.640 align:middle line:90%
are equivalent.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:32.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:37.984 align:middle line:90%


01:13:37.984 --> 01:13:42.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, they're equivalent,
and because they should not

01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:44.520 align:middle line:84%
give you new physics
just because one

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:45.750 align:middle line:90%
is going to change the basis.

01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:46.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So now, here is a
highly nontrivial

01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:54.510 align:middle line:90%
mathematical statement, so now--

01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:59.160 align:middle line:84%
which of course I will not
prove here because it'd just

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:01.590 align:middle line:90%
take too much--

01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:03.000 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.700 align:middle line:90%
So you can show--

01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:10.980 align:middle line:84%
I'll just quote the result.
So you can show, OK,

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:17.490 align:middle line:84%
with a little bit of
effort that under such kind

01:14:17.490 --> 01:14:25.230 align:middle line:84%
of equivalence relation,
means that the similarity

01:14:25.230 --> 01:14:27.180 align:middle line:84%
transformations, they
are all equivalent,

01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:47.520 align:middle line:84%
and such equivalence relation,
the representations of star

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:48.270 align:middle line:90%
is unique.

01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:53.080 align:middle line:90%


01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:55.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:14:55.220 --> 01:15:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So you can show any matrices
which satisfy that equation,

01:15:01.190 --> 01:15:04.640 align:middle line:84%
they're all related by
similarity transformation,

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:07.100 align:middle line:84%
OK, so they're all
physically equivalent.

01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:09.447 align:middle line:84%
They're just corresponding
to a change of basis.

01:15:09.447 --> 01:15:11.405 align:middle line:84%
OK, they're corresponding
to a change of basis.

01:15:11.405 --> 01:15:16.520 align:middle line:90%


01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:17.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:27.860 align:middle line:84%
So but different forms
of the gamma, they may--

01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:29.870 align:middle line:84%
different forms of
the gamma matrices,

01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:32.330 align:middle line:84%
they may be useful for
different purposes.

01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:34.340 align:middle line:84%
OK, they may be useful
for different purposes.

01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:38.840 align:middle line:84%
For example, this
I, solution I we

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:45.860 align:middle line:84%
wrote down before, it's
convenient for if you

01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:47.600 align:middle line:84%
want to take the
nonrelativistic limit.

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:52.450 align:middle line:90%


01:15:52.450 --> 01:15:55.942 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you want
to make a connection

01:15:55.942 --> 01:15:59.170 align:middle line:84%
with a nonrelativistic
quantum mechanics,

01:15:59.170 --> 01:16:03.670 align:middle line:84%
and that's actually the most
convenient form, the matrix

01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:04.870 align:middle line:90%
to use.

01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:08.770 align:middle line:90%
And II is actually in the--

01:16:08.770 --> 01:16:12.190 align:middle line:84%
opposite regime,
it's convenient for

01:16:12.190 --> 01:16:14.320 align:middle line:90%
the ultrarelativistic regime.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:18.510 align:middle line:90%


01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:21.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, so it depends
on which regime,

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:24.660 align:middle line:84%
sometimes you use
different gamma matrices.

01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:30.240 align:middle line:84%
OK, they make your algebra
a bit more convenient.

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:35.570 align:middle line:90%


01:16:35.570 --> 01:16:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So now having introduced
the Dirac equation and then

01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:45.740 align:middle line:84%
the structure of
the Dirac equation,

01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:47.780 align:middle line:84%
but still we haven't
showed that the Dirac

01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:49.390 align:middle line:90%
equation is covariant.

01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:53.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, we just showed that
the Dirac equation can

01:16:53.930 --> 01:16:57.800 align:middle line:84%
have the plane-wave solution
and that the plane-wave solution

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:00.320 align:middle line:84%
will have a standard of
nonrelativistic dispersion

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:01.520 align:middle line:90%
relation.

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:18.820 align:middle line:84%
OK, so in order to show that
the Dirac equation is covariant,

01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:20.530 align:middle line:90%
we have to show--

01:17:20.530 --> 01:17:24.310 align:middle line:84%
we have to make a Lorentz
transform and show

01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:28.580 align:middle line:84%
that the Dirac equations are
the same in every Lorentz frame.

01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:34.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, we have to show that, OK,
and we are running out of time.

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:38.290 align:middle line:84%
So we, of course, won't
have time to do that today,

01:17:38.290 --> 01:17:44.340 align:middle line:84%
but let me just remind you how
this Lorentz covariance works

01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:45.690 align:middle line:90%
for the scalar case.

01:17:45.690 --> 01:17:49.620 align:middle line:84%
OK, so remember, so
recall, yeah, let's

01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:56.070 align:middle line:84%
just quickly recall, for
scalar, we have phi x.

01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:58.703 align:middle line:84%
Then under Lorentz
transformation--

01:17:58.703 --> 01:18:00.120 align:middle line:84%
so consider Lorentz
transformation

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:07.830 align:middle line:84%
which x mu goes to x prime mu
equal to lambda nu mu x nu.

01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Consider such a Lorentz
transformation, OK, so and then

01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:17.130 align:middle line:84%
phi transforms as following,
phi prime x prime phi prime.

01:18:17.130 --> 01:18:19.470 align:middle line:84%
New phi evaluated
at the new position

01:18:19.470 --> 01:18:22.770 align:middle line:84%
should be the same as phi
evaluated at the old position,

01:18:22.770 --> 01:18:24.360 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Or let me just write it here
so that I don't have to erase.

01:18:30.330 --> 01:18:36.480 align:middle line:84%
So the phi-- yeah, just equal
to phi lambda minus 1 x.

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:44.430 align:middle line:84%
So now if you look at the
Klein-Gordon equation,

01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:47.490 align:middle line:84%
let's see how this
is covariant, OK,

01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:49.890 align:middle line:84%
so now let's see in
a different frame.

01:18:49.890 --> 01:18:51.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:53.640 align:middle line:84%
So covariance means
that when we go

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:59.190 align:middle line:84%
to a new frame,
partial prime square--

01:18:59.190 --> 01:19:04.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this means in
the prime coordinates--

01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:10.180 align:middle line:84%
minus m square and phi prime
evaluated at the x prime,

01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:13.000 align:middle line:90%
there must be a--

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.470 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so this is in
another Lorentz frame, OK,

01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:19.540 align:middle line:90%
so they have the same form.

01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, you see these two are
equivalent because this just

01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:26.480 align:middle line:90%
equal to that.

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:30.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, trivially, you could do
that just by definitions.

01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is a Lorentz scalar,
so this is also equal to that.

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:39.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you see that the
Klein-Gordon equation indeed

01:19:39.810 --> 01:19:40.950 align:middle line:90%
is Lorentz covariant.

01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:43.800 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's the same in any frame.

01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:46.940 align:middle line:84%
So now we want to
show, OK, so now we

01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:49.280 align:middle line:84%
want to show that the
Dirac equation has

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:52.477 align:middle line:84%
the same property, OK, and
that is much more nontrivial.

01:19:52.477 --> 01:19:53.810 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's much more nontrivial.

01:19:53.810 --> 01:20:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's really
ingenious, ingenious, yeah,

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.650 align:middle line:90%
but we see, actually, it works.

01:20:03.650 --> 01:20:08.500 align:middle line:90%
OK, so we will do it next time.

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:12.000 align:middle line:90%
