00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.870 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.610 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: OK, good.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So last time, we
quantized this theory.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.850 align:middle line:84%
So let me just write
down the theory again.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.400 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.620 align:middle line:90%
So we quantized this theory.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And so let me also
just write down

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.360 align:middle line:84%
its canonical momentum, density,
and then the Hamiltonian

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.830 align:middle line:90%
density would be 1/2 pi square.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:01:00.700 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And the classical
equation of motion--

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.340 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:84%
and so we're not repeat
the quantization procedure.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.035 align:middle line:84%
And we wrote down the most
general solution at the level--

00:01:20.035 --> 00:01:23.590 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.970 align:middle line:90%
can be written as the following.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:33.670 align:middle line:90%


00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.020 align:middle line:90%
This factor is the convention.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
a k u k plus a k.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.130 align:middle line:84%
So from now on, I
will suppress the hat.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.540 align:middle line:90%
So I will suppress hat.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.360 align:middle line:84%
You should always now view
it as a quantum field--

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.950 align:middle line:90%
quantum operators.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.380 align:middle line:90%
And the plus u k star.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And the u k is the
complete set of solution,

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:16.780 align:middle line:84%
which is given by exponential
minus i omega t plus i k x.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.480 align:middle line:90%


00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So this is just a
basis of solution.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
the most general--

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:84%
so this is the complete solution
to the operator equation

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.350 align:middle line:90%
for this operator phi.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle line:90%
And then you can also find its--

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.000 align:middle line:84%
find its conjugate
momentum density.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So the pi, you can just take
the derivative straightforward.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.370 align:middle line:90%
I will not write it explicitly.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.980 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And then we discussed
that you can

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.890 align:middle line:84%
impose a canonical
commutation relation which

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:12.140 align:middle line:84%
is that the phi t x phi t
x prime equal to pi t x,

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.500 align:middle line:90%
and pi t x prime should be 0.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:28.830 align:middle line:90%
And then phi t x pi t x prime--

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.300 align:middle line:84%
then given by the
delta function.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.420 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we did at
the end of last lecture.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
just plug it in--

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.870 align:middle line:84%
plug this-- plug those
expression into here.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Then you can find the
commutation relations

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.620 align:middle line:90%
between those integrations.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.840 align:middle line:84%
So a k and a k dagger
integrating constant

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.070 align:middle line:90%
of your operator equations.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.560 align:middle line:90%
They are constant operators.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.287 align:middle line:84%
And so when you plug them in,
then you find the canonical--

00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:06.870 align:middle line:84%
then you find the
commutation relation

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.710 align:middle line:90%
between a k and a k dagger.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you find ak and a
k prime equal to a dagger

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:30.140 align:middle line:84%
k and a dagger k prime
is equal to 0 and a k

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:42.375 align:middle line:84%
a k prime dagger is equal to
delta function in the wave

00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:42.875 align:middle line:90%
space.

00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:52.740 align:middle line:90%


00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.570 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you look
at those expressions--

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.930 align:middle line:90%
so they essentially look--

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.820 align:middle line:84%
they essentially--
we essentially

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.810 align:middle line:84%
find the infinite number
of harmonic oscillators.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And each harmonic oscillator
labeled by continuous--

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.740 align:middle line:90%
by a set of continuous number k.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And then the
commutation relation

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.270 align:middle line:84%
is just like a continuum
generalization of standard

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.660 align:middle line:90%
a a dagger equal to 1.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And they are independent
because of this delta function.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.543 align:middle line:84%
And if k is not equal to k
prime, and then you get 0.

00:05:28.543 --> 00:05:29.085 align:middle line:90%
They commute.

00:05:29.085 --> 00:05:33.520 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.950 align:middle line:84%
So you can see the story
a little bit sharper.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.260 align:middle line:84%
That indeed, we just
get the infinite number

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.190 align:middle line:90%
of harmonic oscillators.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.640 align:middle line:84%
So these are just
commutation relations.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.175 align:middle line:84%
This still does not tell you
we have a harmonic oscillator.

00:05:49.175 --> 00:05:50.800 align:middle line:84%
To see harmonic
oscillator, we actually

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.470 align:middle line:84%
need to calculate
the Hamiltonian.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.560 align:middle line:84%
So now let's try to
calculate the Hamiltonian.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:03.680 align:middle line:90%


00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.310 align:middle line:84%
So now we can try to
calculate the Hamiltonian.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.590 align:middle line:90%


00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.260 align:middle line:90%
And so this is just--

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.430 align:middle line:90%
can just do it--

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.460 align:middle line:90%


00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.540 align:middle line:84%
straightforwardly
just plug that in--

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.370 align:middle line:84%
just plot it plug that
expression in we wrote above.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And then you just
plug-in the expression

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:37.190 align:middle line:84%
for the phi and the
pi into that equation,

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.640 align:middle line:84%
and then just straightforward
to calculate it.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And I will not go
through the details.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Of Yeah, it's a
straightforward calculation.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:55.490 align:middle line:84%
So then you find maybe
after some minutes--

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.000 align:middle line:90%


00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.320 align:middle line:84%
then you find that
the following answer.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.537 align:middle line:84%
So now, you-- when
you plug them in,

00:07:04.537 --> 00:07:06.120 align:middle line:84%
then you find that
you can do actually

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:84%
do the spatial integral because
you just have the plane wave.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.560 align:middle line:84%
You can just do the
spatial integral.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And when you do the
spatial integral,

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.210 align:middle line:84%
then that gives you a delta
function momentum space,

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:16.870 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
reduce everything

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:19.410 align:middle line:90%
into a single moment--

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.870 align:middle line:90%
a single k integral.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And then what you find
is that you get omega k.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And then you find
a k dagger a k.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:45.230 align:middle line:90%
And then plus a k dagger.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.190 align:middle line:90%
So let me see.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, actually--
yeah, I think 1/2.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.280 align:middle line:90%


00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.280 align:middle line:90%
Just get that.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
standard expression

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.290 align:middle line:90%
for harmonic oscillator now.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's exactly
identical to just some--

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:10.620 align:middle line:84%
yeah, integral is like sum--
just sum over continuum

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.150 align:middle line:90%
harmonic oscillators.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And each with frequency omega
k, and each harmonic oscillator

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.920 align:middle line:90%
is labeled by this number k.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And so we can do from
the standard trick

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:30.330 align:middle line:84%
to write it actually as
to write as a commutator.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.280 align:middle line:90%
So we can just write it as--

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:41.210 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.340 align:middle line:90%
and then we just have this.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.190 align:middle line:84%
So we combine these
two terms together

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.230 align:middle line:90%
and introduce a commutator.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:52.610 align:middle line:84%
You just have a dagger a
and then plus the commutator

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:53.240 align:middle line:90%
between them.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:09:03.090 align:middle line:90%


00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So in the standard story,
this is equal to 1.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Then you get the standard answer
that you get omega a dagger

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.290 align:middle line:90%
a plus 1/2.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:21.390 align:middle line:90%
But here, we can again--

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.470 align:middle line:90%
let me just write one more step.

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:38.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is k omega k a k
dagger a k, then plus E0.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And now E0 is the sum of all
the zero point energy of all

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:43.810 align:middle line:90%
the harmonic oscillators.

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:52.850 align:middle line:90%


00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:57.770 align:middle line:90%
So 1/2 omega k--

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.880 align:middle line:84%
except that the tricky
thing is the following.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Except now, we have
this commutator

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.300 align:middle line:90%
of a k with a k dagger.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:84%
In the standard case,
this is equal to 1.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:14.570 align:middle line:84%
But in our case, when you
set k prime equal to k,

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.670 align:middle line:90%
you get the delta 0.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.230 align:middle line:90%
So we get delta 0.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:25.760 align:middle line:84%
So then you get that
2 pi cubed delta 3 0.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And remember, this 0
is in momentum space.

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And so this is in k
space, not in the--

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:84%
we have two kinds
of delta functions

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.030 align:middle line:84%
in the-- delta function
in k space, delta function

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:38.340 align:middle line:90%
in coordinate space.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.580 align:middle line:84%
So here, I put the
subscript k-- here

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:46.490 align:middle line:84%
means that this is the
delta function 0 in k space.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
zero point energy.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:59.430 align:middle line:90%


00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:06.030 align:middle line:84%
So this zero point
energy is divergent,

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.758 align:middle line:84%
but we will comment on
that a little bit later.

00:11:09.758 --> 00:11:11.175 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
questions on this?

00:11:11.175 --> 00:11:16.980 align:middle line:90%


00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:17.480 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:25.630 align:middle line:84%
So remark-- let me just
make a couple of remarks.

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:32.220 align:middle line:84%
First is that-- so something
interesting happened.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.060 align:middle line:90%
So when you plug--

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:84%
when you look at the
expression for phi and the pi,

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.820 align:middle line:84%
both phi and the pi
depend on time explicitly.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.610 align:middle line:84%
So there's a time
dependence here.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And here, we only integrate
over spatial direction.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.480 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of integration, we
don't do anything with time.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:01.860 align:middle line:90%
But what do you notice here?

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.930 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.030 align:middle line:90%
What do you notice there?

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.760 align:middle line:90%


00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.710 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So you drop
the time dependence?

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.030 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yes, it's not to
say we drop time dependence

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:16.608 align:middle line:84%
because time
dependence disappeared.

00:12:16.608 --> 00:12:17.275 align:middle line:90%
Do you know why?

00:12:17.275 --> 00:12:21.805 align:middle line:90%


00:12:21.805 --> 00:12:23.930 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: I mean, the
Hamiltonian doesn't explicitly

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.030 align:middle line:90%
depend on time.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.880 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: No, the Hamiltonian--

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.790 align:middle line:84%
phi is time dependent,
pi is time dependent.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:37.540 align:middle line:84%
If you plug-- if you plug
those expression into here,

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.370 align:middle line:90%
certainly this--

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:43.660 align:middle line:84%
certainly inside there is
depend on time explicitly.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.060 align:middle line:84%
This guy is depend
on time explicitly.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.637 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.637 --> 00:12:50.470 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, after
you do the integration

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.630 align:middle line:84%
over spatial
directions, then you

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.550 align:middle line:84%
find in the end the
time dependence actually

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:58.300 align:middle line:90%
cancel during the calculation.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.930 align:middle line:84%
So do you have a guess why
somehow this should cancel?

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:02.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.850 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Energy
conservation or something?

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:05.140 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:10.220 align:middle line:84%
So you have in your pset
that the time translation--

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:14.950 align:middle line:84%
so this system is time
translation symmetric.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.870 align:middle line:84%
It means that you
should have the--

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:21.850 align:middle line:84%
it means that the H
is a conserved number.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:23.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a conserved quantity.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And by-- so indeed, you see that
this is independent of time.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.060 align:middle line:90%
This is a conserved quantity.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.220 align:middle line:90%
We see it explicitly.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:44.410 align:middle line:84%
So there's no time
dependence since H

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:45.950 align:middle line:90%
is a conserved quantity.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:50.900 align:middle line:84%
So this integration
is absolutely crucial,

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:55.010 align:middle line:84%
because if you don't
do integration,

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.990 align:middle line:90%
Hamiltonian density is not--

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.430 align:middle line:84%
it's only the total
Hamiltonian is conserved.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.120 align:middle line:90%


00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.125 align:middle line:90%
So this is a comment.

00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:06.610 align:middle line:90%


00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:10.190 align:middle line:90%
And the second --

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:11.920 align:middle line:84%
so since I only
have two comments,

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.160 align:middle line:84%
let me just call it one
rather than call it 0.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.270 align:middle line:84%
So for the second
comment is that--

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.290 align:middle line:90%
yeah, just repeat.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:26.820 align:middle line:84%
We already said-- you
just have OFT of phi.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And we see this QFT
of phi reduce this

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:44.050 align:middle line:84%
to essentially a
system of a continuum

00:14:44.050 --> 00:15:08.700 align:middle line:84%
of harmonic oscillators labeled
by k with frequency omega k.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.440 align:middle line:84%
So we call this
omega k is defined

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.230 align:middle line:90%
to be k squared plus m square.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:22.990 align:middle line:90%


00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:28.480 align:middle line:84%
So as we mentioned
last time, the fact

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.360 align:middle line:84%
that we actually see infinite
number of harmonic oscillator

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.350 align:middle line:84%
is actually not surprising
from the perspective

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:40.300 align:middle line:84%
that this field theory can
be written as the continuum

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.460 align:middle line:90%
limit of a chain--

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:46.600 align:middle line:84%
say, of atoms
connected by springs.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:50.470 align:middle line:84%
So when you have a
chain, we wrote down

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.390 align:middle line:90%
a one-dimensional system.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.480 align:middle line:84%
You can easily generalize
to three-dimensional.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so you have those chains
of atoms connected by spring,

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.520 align:middle line:84%
and they are just
coupled oscillators.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.898 align:middle line:84%
And then you can just
diagonalize them, and find

00:16:06.898 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:84%
the normal spectrum,
and each of them

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.340 align:middle line:90%
is just a harmonic oscillator.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And so when we find those
solution by doing Fourier

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.040 align:middle line:90%
transform--

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.700 align:middle line:84%
and essentially, we are just
diagonalize those interactions

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.360 align:middle line:90%
between those springs.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, so that's why we get
infinite harmonic oscillator.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:30.190 align:middle line:84%
So from that way, if
you think about it,

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.620 align:middle line:84%
it's totally unsurprising
we get the infinite number

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.240 align:middle line:90%
of harmonic oscillators.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.988 align:middle line:84%
But it does surprising--
it is surprising

00:16:36.988 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:84%
if you think about it from
the point of view of a field

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.210 align:middle line:90%
theory.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.150 align:middle line:84%
So if you find when you
quantize a field theory,

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and then you find
in the end you get

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.080 align:middle line:90%
a bunch of harmonic oscillator.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And before doing
that, it's hard to--

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.060 align:middle line:84%
before you actually carry
out the quantization,

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.240 align:middle line:84%
it's actually hard to
anticipate that if you

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.195 align:middle line:84%
don't have this intuition
from this discrete system.

00:17:01.195 --> 00:17:03.713 align:middle line:90%


00:17:03.713 --> 00:17:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
questions on this?

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:06.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:06.930 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So when
you say that there's

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:08.762 align:middle line:84%
an infinite amount of
harmonic oscillators,

00:17:08.762 --> 00:17:11.220 align:middle line:84%
are you saying that there's an
infinite amount at any given

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.230 align:middle line:84%
point in space,
or that each given

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.099 align:middle line:84%
point in a continuum
of location there

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:16.530 align:middle line:90%
is one harmonic oscillator?

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:21.730 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
a very good question.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And so it's at each point, you
have a harmonic oscillator.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, at each
point-- essentially,

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:32.280 align:middle line:84%
at each point you have
a harmonic oscillator,

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and then they
connected in space.

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:37.780 align:middle line:90%


00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:38.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.292 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Is there any
reason why you didn't

00:17:40.292 --> 00:17:43.570 align:middle line:90%
compute the integral in E0?

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:46.240 align:middle line:84%
You have a delta
function in there?

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.620 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Sorry, say it again?

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.840 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So the
integral if E0 equals.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.130 align:middle line:90%
Why didn't you just--

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:53.710 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Oh, this-- we
cannot do the integral.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:54.820 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: No, up there--

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:55.900 align:middle line:90%
the zero point energy.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:56.775 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Oh, right.

00:17:56.775 --> 00:18:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we will talk
a little bit later,

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:03.790 align:middle line:84%
because later, we are
going to elaborate

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:06.880 align:middle line:84%
on this a little bit later
because we are going to try

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.110 align:middle line:90%
to give interpretation of this.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:15.750 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: In homework 1, we found
that a hat was time dependent.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Is a hat not time
dependent here,

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:22.860 align:middle line:84%
and is that why the Hamiltonian
is not time dependent?

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.860 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, a hat
is a constant operator.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because a hat is
an integration constant

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:32.790 align:middle line:90%
of your operator equation.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.960 align:middle line:90%


00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.593 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:18:37.593 --> 00:18:39.510 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Is there an
analog of coherent states

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.880 align:middle line:84%
for each harmonic
oscillator in the QFT?

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.030 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, there's an
analog of coherent state.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:45.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, indeed.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:46.662 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Does it tell you
anything useful if you are

00:18:46.662 --> 00:18:48.150 align:middle line:90%
in Heisenberg interpretation.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.430 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you can--

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:54.750 align:middle line:90%
yeah, we will-- you will see--

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.460 align:middle line:84%
yeah, this question
will become clearer

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.543 align:middle line:84%
when we talk a little bit
about the Hilbert space.

00:18:58.543 --> 00:19:02.430 align:middle line:90%


00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:03.420 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:07.010 align:middle line:90%


00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:10.720 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's-- before we talk
about the Hilbert space,

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.505 align:middle line:84%
we need to talk
about two things.

00:19:18.505 --> 00:19:22.610 align:middle line:90%


00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So here-- yeah,
here, I have a dot.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.100 align:middle line:90%
And the second thing--

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.460 align:middle line:84%
so Hamiltonian is an
important quantity.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.700 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the
conserved quantity.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.760 align:middle line:84%
So there are other
conserved quantities.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:48.350 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:52.330 align:middle line:84%
So there are other conserved
quantities, and one of them

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.100 align:middle line:84%
is the conserved
quantity corresponding

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.860 align:middle line:90%
to spatial translation.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:01.750 align:middle line:84%
So the spatial translation
gives you conserved momentum--

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:05.210 align:middle line:90%
momentum conservation.

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:84%
So from spatial
translation, then you

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.776 align:middle line:90%
get this conserved charge p i.

00:20:20.776 --> 00:20:23.740 align:middle line:90%


00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Again, you should have
done this in your homework

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.300 align:middle line:90%
to have the following form--

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.210 align:middle line:90%


00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.410 align:middle line:90%
d3 x pi.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:45.370 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:50.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is the Noether charge
for the conserved quantity

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:53.470 align:middle line:84%
associated with the
spatial translation.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And we interpret it as
a spacetime momentum.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.590 align:middle line:84%
This should be interpreted
as spacetime momentum.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:04.440 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- so here, we
have two momentum here.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:12.420 align:middle line:90%
You don't confuse them.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:18.350 align:middle line:84%
So this pi is the canonical
momentum conjugate

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:20.090 align:middle line:90%
to this canonical variable--

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:23.630 align:middle line:90%


00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.270 align:middle line:84%
pi is the canonical
momentum conjugate

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:30.500 align:middle line:90%
to this field variable phi.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is the genuine
physical spacetime momentum.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:37.760 align:middle line:84%
It's the momentum of
your full system--

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.350 align:middle line:90%
of your full physical system.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:42.300 align:middle line:90%


00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And again, we can
just plug it in--

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:49.980 align:middle line:84%
we can just plug in the explicit
expression of pi and phi.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:53.340 align:middle line:84%
We already know
its time evolution.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.080 align:middle line:84%
We already know
the time evolution,

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.120 align:middle line:90%
and then we can plug them in.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And then you find that
the answer is given by--

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:10.410 align:middle line:84%
again, after some smaller
number of minutes calculation.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And then you find that the
answer is given by this.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:17.390 align:middle line:90%


00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:19.680 align:middle line:84%
In this case, there is
no zero point energy.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.230 align:middle line:90%
You just have this expression.

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:30.540 align:middle line:90%


00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And furthermore, you also have
a Lorentz transformation--

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.435 align:middle line:90%
Lorentz symmetry.

00:22:36.435 --> 00:22:42.120 align:middle line:90%


00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And then that will lead to, say,
the conserved charge associated

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.150 align:middle line:90%
with Lorentz transformation.

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And again, you can
find it explicitly.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:57.045 align:middle line:84%
And so in your pset 2, you will
find the expression of this M

00:22:57.045 --> 00:22:59.280 align:middle line:90%
mu nu in terms of phi and pi.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.880 align:middle line:90%


00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
again express this guy

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.500 align:middle line:90%
in terms of a and a dagger.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:12.490 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't have the guts to
assign as the part of the pset,

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:15.420 align:middle line:84%
so I used it as a bonus problem
because that calculation--

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.340 align:middle line:84%
involved a little bit
extra calculation.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it involves a little
bit slightly more tedious

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.030 align:middle line:84%
calculation, so I used
that as a bonus problem

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:29.010 align:middle line:84%
for those people who like
to have some more fun.

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:33.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, anyway, so this you can--

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:35.180 align:middle line:90%
will see in your pset.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.920 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And then again, pi,
you see the explicitly

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.490 align:middle line:90%
that this is time independent--

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:48.086 align:middle line:90%
it's time independent.

00:23:48.086 --> 00:23:53.440 align:middle line:90%


00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.820 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
thing is let's talk

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:58.690 align:middle line:90%
about this zero point energy.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:02.290 align:middle line:90%


00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:05.730 align:middle line:84%
So this zero point energy, we
can write it as the following.

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:08.260 align:middle line:90%


00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:12.730 align:middle line:84%
So we can-- yeah, so
this is a constant.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.120 align:middle line:84%
So you can take it outside
of this k integral.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.510 align:middle line:84%
This does not depend
on k because the--

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.030 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:27.360 align:middle line:84%
So this is just 2
pi cube delta 3 0.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:31.470 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- remember, this
is a k space delta function.

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.390 align:middle line:90%
And then you have the d3 k.

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:43.650 align:middle line:90%


00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:45.660 align:middle line:90%
So that's the expression we get.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:50.750 align:middle line:90%


00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.510 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's try
to understand what's

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:53.680 align:middle line:90%
the meaning of this term?

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.860 align:middle line:90%


00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's try to understand
the meaning of this term.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.705 align:middle line:84%
To understand the
meaning of that term,

00:25:00.705 --> 00:25:03.550 align:middle line:84%
we need to do a little bit
of a mathematical trick.

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:06.460 align:middle line:84%
We need to a little bit
of a mathematical trick.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:12.740 align:middle line:84%
So remember the definition
of delta function,

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:23.540 align:middle line:84%
we have 2 pi cubed delta 3k
equal to the Fourier transform

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:26.400 align:middle line:90%
of the exponential of i k x.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.773 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
definition of-- essentially,

00:25:28.773 --> 00:25:30.315 align:middle line:84%
the definition of
the delta function.

00:25:30.315 --> 00:25:35.730 align:middle line:90%


00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And now, here, we want
to set k equal to 0.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.670 align:middle line:90%
So let's set k equal to 0 here.

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And then we find that
these 2 pi cubed theta 0--

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:51.450 align:middle line:84%
so let's remember this
again in the k space.

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And then we just set
k equal to 0 here.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.070 align:middle line:90%
And then what is this?

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:59.040 align:middle line:84%
If you set k equal to
0, you get what this?

00:25:59.040 --> 00:25:59.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:00.390 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: The volume--

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:01.230 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:01.860 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: --of the full space.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.068 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: You just get the
volume of the full space.

00:26:04.068 --> 00:26:07.590 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:10.080 align:middle line:90%
Let's just imagine you--

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.150 align:middle line:84%
in order to make sense
of this quantity,

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:15.990 align:middle line:84%
you can put the whole
universe in a big box.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the whole
universe is in a big box,

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:21.570 align:middle line:84%
and then this is
the total volume.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:24.877 align:middle line:84%
And now, since
this is the volume,

00:26:24.877 --> 00:26:26.460 align:middle line:84%
now we have a very
good interpretation

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.510 align:middle line:90%
of this quantity.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And now we can write E0 as
merely volume times epsilon 0.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.723 align:middle line:84%
And then this quantity
epsilon 0 then

00:26:36.723 --> 00:26:38.640 align:middle line:84%
have the interpretation
of the energy density.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:46.610 align:middle line:90%


00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:47.870 align:middle line:90%
So now this is energy density.

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:56.000 align:middle line:90%


00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.910 align:middle line:84%
So this energy density, we can
write it in one more step--

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:02.270 align:middle line:90%
so continue to here.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.490 align:middle line:84%
So we can write
it one more step.

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Plug in the expression
value of omega k.

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.710 align:middle line:90%
So this is the--

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:10.460 align:middle line:90%
just 1/2.

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:13.220 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:23.400 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, I forgot 2 pi d k.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.470 align:middle line:90%
And then you have k square.

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:28.680 align:middle line:90%


00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.255 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so that's what you get.

00:27:30.255 --> 00:27:32.940 align:middle line:90%


00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.350 align:middle line:84%
So how do you like
this integral?

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.790 align:middle line:90%


00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:41.390 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So just a
question to go back here.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't it be quicker if you
just left the delta function

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:84%
inside of your
integral and just say

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.560 align:middle line:90%
that it's one for your entire--

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.180 align:middle line:90%
like for all k.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:53.950 align:middle line:84%
So why are those two
pictures equivalent?

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Because in that picture,
you don't get the volume?

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.170 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Sorry, say it again?

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:00.190 align:middle line:90%
What's two picture?

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:03.100 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: If you didn't pull
out your delta function from

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.230 align:middle line:84%
your integral-- you
just did it with--

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.570 align:middle line:84%
that delta function
is one for all k.

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:10.210 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, because
this is just a constant.

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Just when you have an
integral of a constant,

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.830 align:middle line:90%
you can always pull it out.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Because delta 0 does
not depend on k anymore.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:21.920 align:middle line:90%


00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:22.910 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:26.020 align:middle line:84%
So how do you like
this integral?

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.640 align:middle line:90%
Can you do it?

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.900 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: No, it diverges

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:29.650 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:32.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's fruitless
to do this integral

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.120 align:middle line:90%
because this is divergent.

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:38.580 align:middle line:90%


00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's very good reason
for this divergence physically.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.530 align:middle line:84%
So this is just
the energy density.

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:51.015 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, this is the
energy per unit volume--

00:28:51.015 --> 00:28:53.630 align:middle line:90%


00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:56.800 align:middle line:90%
say in some unit volume.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So let's imagine you
have a unit volume here.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:04.200 align:middle line:90%


00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Remember, this-- beside-- before
this, corresponding to you

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.810 align:middle line:84%
take a discrete system with
some lattice spacing a,

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:19.200 align:middle line:84%
and then you take the lattice,
and each lattice point,

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.940 align:middle line:84%
you have a harmonic
oscillator, and then

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:24.300 align:middle line:84%
you take a lattice
spacing-- a equal to 0.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.550 align:middle line:84%
So that means for
any unit volume, when

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:30.090 align:middle line:84%
you take a equal to 0,
you have infinite number

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:31.125 align:middle line:90%
of oscillators inside.

00:29:31.125 --> 00:29:33.810 align:middle line:90%


00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:35.475 align:middle line:84%
So essentially,
when you-- yeah, you

00:29:35.475 --> 00:29:39.180 align:middle line:84%
have the lattice of
oscillators at each point.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I will not
try to draw it.

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And then when you take a
to 0, you have any unit--

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:49.680 align:middle line:84%
any volume unit, you will
have the number of oscillators

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:53.430 align:middle line:84%
go to infinity, and that's
where this divergence come from.

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:54.900 align:middle line:90%
It just come from--

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.000 align:middle line:84%
in field theory, you have a
continuum degree of freedom.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.030 align:middle line:84%
So at each point, you
have a degree of freedom,

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:02.670 align:middle line:84%
and within any volume,
then you definitely

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:05.010 align:middle line:84%
have infinite number
of degrees of freedom.

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:11.770 align:middle line:84%
so this is just from
continuum of freedom.

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:15.430 align:middle line:84%
So this is the first
time you see a diverging

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:18.160 align:middle line:84%
quantity in quantum
field theory,

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.185 align:middle line:84%
but you will soon
find that this is--

00:30:20.185 --> 00:30:22.830 align:middle line:90%


00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:26.760 align:middle line:84%
soon, you find that
this is normal.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.080 align:middle line:90%
It will be a fact of life.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:31.410 align:middle line:84%
Just you will see
divergence very commonly--

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.140 align:middle line:84%
and so-- because you have
continuum degrees of freedom.

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.090 align:middle line:90%


00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:41.320 align:middle line:84%
So the whole thing about
quantum field theory

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:45.580 align:middle line:84%
is to find a way to deal
with those divergences.

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And one of the key differences
between quantum field theory

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.970 align:middle line:84%
and just finite quantum
mechanics or finite number

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:56.170 align:middle line:84%
degrees of freedom is
because of those divergences.

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And the big part of
quantum field theory

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.790 align:middle line:84%
is to understand how to
treat those divergences.

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And they actually don't
affect your physics,

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:08.830 align:middle line:84%
but you do have to develop
sometimes sophisticated tricks

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:14.090 align:middle line:90%
to treat OK,

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:14.590 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:17.430 align:middle line:90%


00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And this infinite
answer is also closely

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:26.670 align:middle line:84%
connected to a very famous
problem you may have heard.

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:30.360 align:middle line:84%
It's called the cosmological
constant problem.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Because this tells you
that any quantum field

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:40.480 align:middle line:84%
theory have an infinite,
say, 0 point energy.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.090 align:middle line:90%
And so you may say, OK--

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:50.730 align:middle line:84%
so infinite-- whenever we
say something infinite,

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:55.800 align:middle line:84%
there's one thing you
always do to treat it.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Can you guess what is
the thing you always

00:31:57.620 --> 00:31:59.150 align:middle line:90%
do when you see infinities?

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:02.690 align:middle line:90%


00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:03.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.550 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Just like
subtract infinity.

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:07.600 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's one idea.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.560 align:middle line:84%
That's one idea, but to
subtract infinity is very hard.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.240 align:middle line:84%
In your calculus class,
when you subtract infinity

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.680 align:middle line:84%
from infinity, you
can get infinity,

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.580 align:middle line:90%
so you have to be very careful.

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:20.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:22.150 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: Just ignore the term.

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:23.900 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: That's a
lot of very good idea.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.690 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:28.220 align:middle line:90%
Indeed, that's what we often do.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:28.820 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.980 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: Divide by.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:33.350 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: That's also-- indeed.

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:39.220 align:middle line:84%
But to do all those things,
you have to do one thing first.

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:42.673 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: You might approximate
it, it's like 1 over the Planck

00:32:42.673 --> 00:32:43.300 align:middle line:90%
constant.

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.180 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
it's also very close.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.434 align:middle line:90%
You need to do--

00:32:46.434 --> 00:32:47.267 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:47.267 --> 00:32:47.694 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Hmm?

00:32:47.694 --> 00:32:48.550 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:49.592 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

00:32:49.592 --> 00:32:52.900 align:middle line:84%
You need to find a way
to make it finite first,

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.580 align:middle line:90%
and then you can subtract it.

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And then you can-- yeah, just
like when you sum 1 plus 1/2

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:00.740 align:middle line:90%
plus 1/3, et cetera.

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:03.970 align:middle line:90%
You get an infinite series.

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:06.290 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to estimate
the outcome-- yeah,

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:07.090 align:middle line:90%
you get divergence.

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:10.330 align:middle line:84%
But you always try to
cut it off the series,

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:12.400 align:middle line:84%
and then approximate
definite answer.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.560 align:middle line:90%
And here is similar.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So here we always put
some momentum cut-off.

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:22.840 align:middle line:84%
So imagine the
momentum is smaller

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.930 align:middle line:84%
than some momentum--
say, some value lambda.

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And lambda
corresponding to maybe

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:30.520 align:middle line:84%
to the scale which this quantum
field is no longer apply,

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:33.250 align:middle line:84%
because nobody told you
that this quantum field

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:36.190 align:middle line:84%
theory should apply
at all length scales.

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Because for example,
in this lattice model,

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.815 align:middle line:84%
this scale will be 1
over the lattice spacing.

00:33:41.815 --> 00:33:45.440 align:middle line:90%


00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so once you
cut it off, still you

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:52.840 align:middle line:90%
get a pretty big number.

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot ignore it because
this is a physical zero point

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:57.730 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:00.280 align:middle line:84%
In principle, you
can measure it.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:03.980 align:middle line:84%
But in real life,
we don't see it.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:07.810 align:middle line:84%
So we have quantum fields
flying around all the time,

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:10.580 align:middle line:84%
but we don't see this
big vacuum energy.

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.900 align:middle line:84%
So this is called the
cosmological constant problem.

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:18.429 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there was just
a colloquium last week

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:21.310 align:middle line:84%
about this cosmological related
to this cosmological constant

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:23.800 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:24.300 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:25.199 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:28.143 align:middle line:90%


00:34:28.143 --> 00:34:29.685 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can talk
about Hilbert space.

00:34:29.685 --> 00:34:43.870 align:middle line:90%


00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:47.380 align:middle line:90%
So as a harmonic oscillator--

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:50.110 align:middle line:84%
so we can first define
the vacuum state.

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:55.980 align:middle line:84%
So now, what we will do is
indeed in quantum field theory

00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:00.210 align:middle line:84%
itself, we can just
ignore this E0.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:02.880 align:middle line:90%


00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:06.660 align:middle line:84%
From now on, we will just
ignore this E0 because this just

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:07.920 align:middle line:90%
to give you overall--

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:13.140 align:middle line:84%
just give you a constant,
which does not do anything.

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:16.860 align:middle line:84%
It's like the potential
energy E and M.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just like the unit--
yeah, just like the-- anyway,

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:25.280 align:middle line:84%
so from now on, we
ignore this term.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.372 align:middle line:84%
So often, I will just
write the Hamiltonian--

00:35:27.372 --> 00:35:28.330 align:middle line:90%
I just write this term.

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:32.180 align:middle line:90%


00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:35.663 align:middle line:84%
But later, we actually
see examples--

00:35:35.663 --> 00:35:36.830 align:middle line:90%
later, we will see examples.

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this E0 can actually
have physical implications,

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:43.040 align:middle line:84%
but just for our current
purpose, we ignore it.

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:46.570 align:middle line:90%


00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:49.280 align:middle line:84%
So now, the lowest
energy state--

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.740 align:middle line:84%
then it's clear from
here because this

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.310 align:middle line:90%
is just a constant.

00:35:54.310 --> 00:36:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So the lowest energy
state ground state, which

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:04.790 align:middle line:84%
is we often call
the vacuum state,

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:09.790 align:middle line:84%
means there's nothing there,
is given by a k 0 equal

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:15.130 align:middle line:90%
to 0 defined to be for any k.

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:19.730 align:middle line:84%
So the ground state satisfy,
which I denoted by 0--

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:24.610 align:middle line:84%
then satisfy
annihlated by this ak.

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:27.580 align:middle line:90%
And then the general state--

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:31.210 align:middle line:84%
you can just-- so general
states have the following form.

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:36.150 align:middle line:90%


00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:38.790 align:middle line:90%
Say I can write n k 1.

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:42.090 align:middle line:84%
So the k 1 oscillator
excited n times.

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:45.930 align:middle line:90%
n k 2-- n k--

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:49.380 align:middle line:84%
the k 2 oscillator
excited n k 2 times,

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:52.140 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, which is given by--

00:36:52.140 --> 00:37:00.780 align:middle line:84%
which is proportional to a k
1 dagger to the power n k 1

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:09.060 align:middle line:84%
a k 2 dagger n k 2
etcetera acting on 0

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:13.170 align:middle line:84%
just like we have large number
of harmonic oscillators.

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:22.390 align:middle line:90%


00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:23.980 align:middle line:90%
Questions on this?

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:24.798 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:37:24.798 --> 00:37:26.340 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: How do you
know there exists

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:28.757 align:middle line:84%
some state that's annihilated
by every single annihilation

00:37:28.757 --> 00:37:30.010 align:middle line:90%
operator?

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:34.150 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: You postulate,
but you can actually write it

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:37.750 align:middle line:90%
down its wave function.

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Just as in the standard
harmonic oscillator case,

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:48.624 align:middle line:84%
you can starting from a
dagger annihlated by a.

00:37:48.624 --> 00:37:50.830 align:middle line:84%
You can start from this
equation to write down

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:51.950 align:middle line:90%
its wave function.

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And here, you can write down
the wave function for the vacuum

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.500 align:middle line:90%
state to in terms of phi.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.790 align:middle line:90%


00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:01.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:03.300 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: In the notation
for the ket there

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.990 align:middle line:84%
it looks like we have countable
number of frequencies?

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:08.738 align:middle line:90%
Is that, like why is that?

00:38:08.738 --> 00:38:09.780 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: You mean here?

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:10.580 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:12.720 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, here,
I'm just saying it

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.145 align:middle line:90%
depends on which k are excited.

00:38:15.145 --> 00:38:17.763 align:middle line:90%


00:38:17.763 --> 00:38:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's a
very good question.

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:22.140 align:middle line:84%
I will comment on
related issues very soon.

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:26.660 align:middle line:84%
But here, I just
write down some state.

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:30.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, excite k1, k2 as I want.

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:34.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying
that this is the--

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:37.488 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you can have
as many as you want.

00:38:37.488 --> 00:38:39.780 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Yeah, but if you
use that notation it's still.

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:40.230 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.770 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, but I write it--

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:45.850 align:middle line:84%
when I write it
this way, it implies

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:48.690 align:middle line:84%
I only excite countable
number of them.

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:51.720 align:middle line:84%
But in principle--
yeah, we will soon

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:55.110 align:middle line:84%
touch a point, which is
related to your question.

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:56.040 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:59.200 align:middle line:90%


00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.470 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And so for example, the
simplest excited state

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:06.660 align:middle line:84%
would be just
excite one of them.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.420 align:middle line:90%


00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.930 align:middle line:90%
So let me denote this by k.

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And then the simplest way
you just excite two of them.

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:24.690 align:middle line:90%


00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:26.690 align:middle line:84%
So this k1 and k2
can be the same.

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:31.820 align:middle line:84%
If these k1 k2 are the same,
and then just like the square.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And here, also I
will not be very

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:37.180 align:middle line:90%
careful about the normalization.

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And now, we ask, what are
the physical interpretations

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.060 align:middle line:90%
of those states?

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:47.816 align:middle line:84%
So now let's ask what are
the physical interpretations?

00:39:47.816 --> 00:39:54.980 align:middle line:90%


00:39:54.980 --> 00:40:04.850 align:middle line:84%
So for this purpose, we can just
look at their quantum numbers

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:08.735 align:middle line:84%
under, say, the Hamiltonian and
under the spacetime momentum.

00:40:08.735 --> 00:40:11.660 align:middle line:90%


00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:14.690 align:middle line:90%
So for example, H 0--

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:19.260 align:middle line:84%
so if you act on H
on 0, then of course,

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:25.010 align:middle line:84%
you get 0 assuming
we throw E0 away.

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:31.070 align:middle line:90%
Say ignore E0 so far.

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And then so for
the ground state--

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:35.660 align:middle line:90%
and the p i acting on 0.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:37.430 align:middle line:90%
Of course, it's 0.

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So you can see just
because this have ak here.

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:42.560 align:middle line:90%
And so E also--

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.242 align:middle line:84%
when we throw this away,
you have this --yeah.

00:40:45.242 --> 00:40:47.980 align:middle line:90%


00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.456 align:middle line:84%
And now, let's look
at the excited state.

00:40:50.456 --> 00:40:54.760 align:middle line:90%


00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:59.650 align:middle line:90%
So now to look at this state.

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:02.320 align:middle line:90%
So H acting on k--

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:05.650 align:middle line:84%
so this answer is obvious
because all different

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:08.260 align:middle line:84%
oscillators, they are
independent of each other,

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:11.770 align:middle line:90%
and this just gives you omega k.

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:14.110 align:middle line:84%
We can just use our result
for harmonic oscillator.

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:18.090 align:middle line:90%


00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And now, you can look
at the momentum--

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:23.280 align:middle line:90%


00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:28.580 align:middle line:84%
so this is a spacetime momentum
operator acting on here.

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:32.030 align:middle line:90%
And then it has k i.

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:37.550 align:middle line:84%
If you look at this
expression, when you do the--

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:40.730 align:middle line:90%
act this on that--

00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:43.520 align:middle line:90%


00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:48.470 align:middle line:84%
you act this on that,
and when you can just

00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:51.470 align:middle line:84%
use the standard trick
when you do the commutator.

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And then the particular
k for this is chosen,

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.775 align:middle line:84%
and then the eigenvalue will be
just given by that particular k

00:41:57.775 --> 00:41:58.700 align:middle line:90%
i.

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is one step
of calculation there,

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:03.470 align:middle line:90%
and you should do it yourself.

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:06.830 align:middle line:90%
1-minute calculation.

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:09.170 align:middle line:84%
This a delta function
will be generated,

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:12.200 align:middle line:84%
and then that will get
rid of that integral,

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.820 align:middle line:84%
and then you will
pick up this k i.

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:18.220 align:middle line:90%


00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:20.440 align:middle line:90%
So now, this equation has very--

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:24.790 align:middle line:84%
now has an obvious
physical interpretation.

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:31.810 align:middle line:84%
So that means that this state
k has spacetime momentum.

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:38.850 align:middle line:84%
So now, I write down a
four-momentum omega k n k.

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:43.500 align:middle line:84%
So this is exactly the momentum
of a relativistic particle

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.480 align:middle line:90%
on shell.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:49.200 align:middle line:90%
So this is of a relativistic--

00:42:49.200 --> 00:43:04.510 align:middle line:84%
so this is a momentum of
a relativistic particle,

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:06.500 align:middle line:84%
because omega k is
equal to k squared

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.440 align:middle line:90%
plus m square of mass m.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:14.190 align:middle line:90%


00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this means
that the p squared.

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:19.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is a four-vector
squared is equal to m--

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:21.610 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so this
satisfies the p squared

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:22.750 align:middle line:90%
equal to minus m square.

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:27.560 align:middle line:90%


00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.570 align:middle line:90%
So we can just--

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:31.550 align:middle line:84%
so it's very logical
just to interpret this

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:37.240 align:middle line:84%
as a particle of mass m,
because we can just interpret it

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.240 align:middle line:90%
as a particle of mass m.

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.400 align:middle line:90%


00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.950 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:46.080 align:middle line:90%
So now, let's look at this one.

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.260 align:middle line:84%
So again, the calculation
is very simple.

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:50.600 align:middle line:90%
So you find for that one--

00:43:50.600 --> 00:44:28.220 align:middle line:90%


00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:31.040 align:middle line:90%
so you find for that one--

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:40.560 align:middle line:90%
for k1 k2, you find the energy--

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.820 align:middle line:84%
energy just defined--
again, you find

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.370 align:middle line:84%
that this is an energy
eigenstate of the H.

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:49.450 align:middle line:84%
It's an eigenstate of H
with energy eigenvalue

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:52.390 align:middle line:90%
omega k1 plus omega k2.

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:55.480 align:middle line:90%


00:44:55.480 --> 00:45:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's a momentum eigenstate
of P i with an eigenvalue given

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:02.860 align:middle line:90%
by k1 plus k2.

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:09.480 align:middle line:90%


00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:27.954 align:middle line:84%
So E, k are
eigenvalues of H and P.

00:45:27.954 --> 00:45:28.920 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: Question.

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:29.810 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:31.890 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Yeah, so
could that mass be 0?

00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:34.830 align:middle line:90%


00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:38.540 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: So here-- so this
mass is not 0 because omega k

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:40.970 align:middle line:90%
is defined to be this--

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:44.970 align:middle line:84%
it's defined by my theory--
defined by my Lagrangian.

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
parameter of your--

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:50.670 align:middle line:90%
yeah, of your action.

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:51.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:54.720 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So I have a --
with the energy spectrum,

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.650 align:middle line:90%
does the spacing--

00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:57.240 align:middle line:84%
does it happen
the same way where

00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.640 align:middle line:84%
the spacing gets smaller
as you go to higher

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.750 align:middle line:90%
and higher energies or?

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:03.780 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, for
here, it's uniform.

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Here, just for each
k, it's uniform.

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:08.140 align:middle line:84%
But of course, when
you add them together,

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.590 align:middle line:84%
you get something
very complicated.

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:12.675 align:middle line:84%
But for each k,
you just uniform.

00:46:12.675 --> 00:46:16.020 align:middle line:90%


00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:18.270 align:middle line:84%
So the very-- so
the most natural way

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:29.310 align:middle line:84%
to interpret this is
just have two particles

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:45.302 align:middle line:84%
of momentum of four momenta
omega k1 k1 and omega k2 k2.

00:46:45.302 --> 00:46:48.750 align:middle line:90%


00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, you can do
this for any state like this.

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.910 align:middle line:90%


00:46:56.910 --> 00:47:11.400 align:middle line:84%
They are all eigenvectors
of H and P. So n k 1, n k 2,

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.360 align:middle line:90%
you catch--

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:13.320 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:21.105 align:middle line:84%
So this corresponding to n
k 1 particles of momentum.

00:47:21.105 --> 00:47:23.900 align:middle line:90%


00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:26.670 align:middle line:90%
They're all on shell--

00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:33.290 align:middle line:84%
on shell particle
of momentum k1 and n

00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:37.950 align:middle line:84%
k 2 has two particles
of momentum k2.

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:41.490 align:middle line:90%


00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:44.190 align:middle line:90%
So this tells you one thing.

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:48.225 align:middle line:84%
So now let me just
make some remarks.

00:47:48.225 --> 00:47:59.960 align:middle line:90%


00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Any questions on this
before I make my remarks?

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:05.350 align:middle line:90%


00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:06.190 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So the first point
is that now you

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:12.430 align:middle line:84%
can see this can describe
any number of particles.

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:21.150 align:middle line:90%


00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:23.010 align:middle line:84%
So mathematically,
in our description,

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:25.830 align:middle line:90%
there are harmonic oscillators.

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:27.838 align:middle line:84%
But each excitation of
the harmonic oscillator

00:48:27.838 --> 00:48:29.880 align:middle line:84%
is from the spacetime
point of view corresponding

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.690 align:middle line:90%
to a particle.

00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:35.190 align:middle line:84%
So this is the beautiful
thing of this theory.

00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:40.730 align:middle line:90%


00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:44.810 align:middle line:90%
And then due to--

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:49.190 align:middle line:84%
because of the commutation
relation, a k 1 dagger,

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:53.440 align:middle line:84%
a k 2 dagger equal
to 0 for any k1 k2.

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.990 align:middle line:90%


00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:57.550 align:middle line:90%
So you have full symmetry.

00:48:57.550 --> 00:48:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So when you construct
the state, you

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:01.660 align:middle line:84%
can just commute
them as you want.

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.640 align:middle line:90%
So that means they're--

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:21.090 align:middle line:84%
so full symmetry in permuting
all these different particles

00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:22.215 align:middle line:90%
in the general state.

00:49:22.215 --> 00:49:27.840 align:middle line:90%


00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.560 align:middle line:84%
So this tells us
these are bosons.

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:43.750 align:middle line:90%


00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:50.035 align:middle line:84%
And two is that all particles
have positive energy.

00:49:50.035 --> 00:49:58.010 align:middle line:90%


00:49:58.010 --> 00:50:07.510 align:middle line:84%
So even though that
E squared equal to k

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:10.990 align:middle line:84%
squared plus m squared-- this
equation have two solutions--

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:13.960 align:middle line:90%
plus minus omega k.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:16.120 align:middle line:84%
But when you look
at physical state--

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.370 align:middle line:84%
when you look at your state
and look at the eigenvalue

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:18.980 align:middle line:90%
of state--

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:21.040 align:middle line:84%
so all particles have
physical energies,

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:24.160 align:middle line:84%
so you don't have this negative
energy problem associated

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.375 align:middle line:90%
with taking the square root.

00:50:25.375 --> 00:50:43.990 align:middle line:90%


00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Also you have total
energy of a state

00:50:55.510 --> 00:51:04.690 align:middle line:84%
is equal to sum of energies
of all the particles.

00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:11.890 align:middle line:90%


00:51:11.890 --> 00:51:15.250 align:middle line:84%
So this tells you there's no
interactions between them.

00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have potential
energies between particles,

00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:21.940 align:middle line:84%
and then that will
change the energy.

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:24.190 align:middle line:84%
When you put the two
particles together,

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:27.130 align:middle line:84%
will no longer be
the same over the sum

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:30.280 align:middle line:84%
of the individual energy
for each particle.

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And so that tells you
there's no interactions.

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:38.186 align:middle line:84%
So this is a theory
of free particles.

00:51:38.186 --> 00:51:47.930 align:middle line:90%


00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:50.065 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a good
starting point.

00:51:50.065 --> 00:51:53.050 align:middle line:90%


00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:54.580 align:middle line:90%
At least now, we have particles.

00:51:54.580 --> 00:52:05.170 align:middle line:90%


00:52:05.170 --> 00:52:07.030 align:middle line:90%
Questions on this?

00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:12.640 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So
[INAUDIBLE] a k 1 let's

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.710 align:middle line:84%
say, and you have a
particle with momentum k1

00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:17.950 align:middle line:84%
now, is there a way to change
this particle's momentum,

00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:20.530 align:middle line:84%
or if you apply again,
you-- like in this picture,

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:23.285 align:middle line:84%
it's like you have another
particle momentum k1.

00:52:23.285 --> 00:52:24.910 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, there's
no way to change

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:26.380 align:middle line:90%
the momentum of a particle.

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:29.110 align:middle line:84%
So once you created
the particle,

00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:30.580 align:middle line:90%
it just goes straight.

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it just does
not change anymore.

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Momentum for that
particle is conserved.

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:39.160 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Is there--
if you wanted to--

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:40.780 align:middle line:84%
if you wanted to
create a theory where

00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:43.300 align:middle line:84%
you can change the momentum,
is there a way, or is it just--

00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:44.870 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, there is a way.

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:46.960 align:middle line:84%
So after dealing with
this free theory,

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:50.500 align:middle line:84%
and then we will consider
the last simplest theory,

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and then that will
introduce interactions.

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:52.585 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: I see.

00:52:52.585 --> 00:52:52.660 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:54.410 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: And when
you have interactions,

00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:56.620 align:middle line:84%
then the particle
momentum can change.

00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:57.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:58.578 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So the
thing we're calling

00:52:58.578 --> 00:53:00.640 align:middle line:84%
particles are like
localized in momentum space,

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:02.553 align:middle line:84%
but not at all in
position space.

00:53:02.553 --> 00:53:03.220 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:05.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, these are the momentum--

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:09.220 align:middle line:84%
yeah, it's like the plane wave
in the non-relativistic-- yeah.

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:11.713 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: And if you were to
try to localize it in position

00:53:11.713 --> 00:53:13.630 align:middle line:84%
space like a Gaussian
wave packet or something

00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:15.100 align:middle line:84%
kind of like that,
would you still

00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:16.780 align:middle line:84%
be able to commute
things and stuff?

00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:19.390 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
the commute things

00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:23.410 align:middle line:84%
don't change because
everything is built by a k,

00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:26.720 align:middle line:84%
and they always commute,
and so that won't change.

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:28.750 align:middle line:84%
But indeed, we will talk
about the wave packet

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:31.840 align:middle line:90%
to localize in space.

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:35.090 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:35.830 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:53:35.830 --> 00:53:52.610 align:middle line:90%


00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:55.060 align:middle line:90%
So also-- so the last--

00:53:55.060 --> 00:54:01.150 align:middle line:84%
we will talk a little bit
about the technical point.

00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:04.900 align:middle line:90%


00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:09.130 align:middle line:84%
It's that so far, we haven't
talked about the normalization

00:54:09.130 --> 00:54:10.853 align:middle line:90%
of such a state.

00:54:10.853 --> 00:54:12.895 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's look at the
normalization of state.

00:54:12.895 --> 00:54:21.550 align:middle line:90%


00:54:21.550 --> 00:54:25.605 align:middle line:84%
So let's just look
at this state.

00:54:25.605 --> 00:54:26.980 align:middle line:84%
The single particle
state-- let's

00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:30.800 align:middle line:90%
look at this normalization.

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:33.010 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at k with k prime.

00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:36.310 align:middle line:90%


00:54:36.310 --> 00:54:39.940 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you take the overlap
of this with the k prime,

00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and then you can reduce this
to the commutator of a k

00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:44.150 align:middle line:90%
and a k prime--

00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:46.120 align:middle line:90%
a k dagger and a k prime.

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:50.380 align:middle line:90%
So you will get just this.

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:54.560 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is a
five-second calculation.

00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:57.865 align:middle line:84%
So you find this if
you do the overlap.

00:54:57.865 --> 00:55:02.380 align:middle line:90%


00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:06.850 align:middle line:84%
But you already
did in your p set--

00:55:06.850 --> 00:55:09.310 align:middle line:84%
this thing is actually
not Lorentz invariant.

00:55:09.310 --> 00:55:11.150 align:middle line:90%
This is another good thing.

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:16.150 align:middle line:84%
This is another good object
under Lorentz transformations.

00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:18.580 align:middle line:84%
But when we construct
state, we would

00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:21.400 align:middle line:84%
like to have our state to have
good properties under Lorentz

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.260 align:middle line:90%
transformation.

00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:28.090 align:middle line:84%
So we will choose a slightly
different normalization.

00:55:28.090 --> 00:55:33.400 align:middle line:84%
So instead of this
state, so we will

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.350 align:middle line:90%
define the following states.

00:55:35.350 --> 00:55:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And we will define a k
now without the vector

00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:46.300 align:middle line:84%
to be the square root
2 omega k and this k.

00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:48.950 align:middle line:90%


00:55:48.950 --> 00:56:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the 2 square root
of k a k dagger acting on 0.

00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And now, if you compute the
overlap with this k and k

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:08.610 align:middle line:90%
prime--

00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:10.940 align:middle line:90%
so now, you have square root k--

00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:13.010 align:middle line:84%
square root omega
k, for one of them,

00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:15.740 align:middle line:84%
and then you have square
root k for two of them,

00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:17.435 align:middle line:90%
and then you have 2 omega k.

00:56:17.435 --> 00:56:20.030 align:middle line:90%


00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And then you have 2 pi cubed
delta 3k k minus [INAUDIBLE]..

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:33.190 align:middle line:84%
So now you recognize this
object from your pset.

00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:37.030 align:middle line:84%
The omega k multiply
by this guy actually

00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:40.660 align:middle line:84%
have good Lorentz
transformation properties.

00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:46.840 align:middle line:84%
So this guy actually
transforms nicely

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:50.480 align:middle line:90%
under Lorentz transformations.

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:53.170 align:middle line:84%
So this will be
the normalization

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:55.480 align:middle line:90%
we will use from now on.

00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:58.880 align:middle line:90%


00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:02.600 align:middle line:90%
So these states have very--

00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:05.630 align:middle line:90%
so indeed, you can show--

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:08.630 align:middle line:84%
so that will be, I
think, in your pset 3.

00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:10.580 align:middle line:90%
You should look forward to it.

00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So you can show if you act
a Lorentz transformation--

00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:18.740 align:middle line:84%
so lambda is a Lorentz
transformation,

00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:22.460 align:middle line:84%
and u Lambda is the operator
to generate that Lorentz

00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:24.590 align:middle line:90%
transformation--

00:57:24.590 --> 00:57:28.370 align:middle line:84%
on such a state k, and
then you just get lambda k.

00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And lambda k is the
Lorentz transformation

00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:32.900 align:middle line:90%
acting on that k.

00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:35.060 align:middle line:84%
It's the Lorentz
transform the k.

00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:37.880 align:middle line:90%


00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:46.720 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, you should see
your maybe p set 3, so--

00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:47.815 align:middle line:90%
if I remember it.

00:57:47.815 --> 00:57:53.950 align:middle line:90%


00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:54.470 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:55.510 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:57:55.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:middle line:90%


00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:05.570 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So I'm not
sure in this case

00:58:05.570 --> 00:58:08.940 align:middle line:84%
here why we assume that omega
k is the same for both k and k

00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:09.440 align:middle line:90%
prime?

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:12.320 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Oh, because you
have a delta function here.

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:15.005 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because omega
k only depend on k--

00:58:15.005 --> 00:58:16.505 align:middle line:84%
it only depends on
the spatial part.

00:58:16.505 --> 00:58:19.313 align:middle line:90%


00:58:19.313 --> 00:58:19.980 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:20.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:58:20.490 --> 00:58:22.657 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Yeah, so the inner
product of the k k prime

00:58:22.657 --> 00:58:24.270 align:middle line:90%
is not Lorentz invariant.

00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Is that just if you're
listing one of the states?

00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:34.353 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, just
this guy-- when you--

00:58:34.353 --> 00:58:36.270 align:middle line:84%
it's not about whether
it's Lorentz invariant.

00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:37.395 align:middle line:90%
It's not Lorentz covariant.

00:58:37.395 --> 00:58:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Just when you transform
it, just this object--

00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:44.660 align:middle line:84%
when you transform
it, it's very awkward.

00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Does not have very--
you can transform it.

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:49.520 align:middle line:84%
You can write down a
transformation for this object.

00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:52.190 align:middle line:84%
It just does not
transform nicely.

00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:55.070 align:middle line:84%
Then that means if this
does not transform nicely,

00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:57.800 align:middle line:84%
it means each of them
don't transform nicely,

00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:00.600 align:middle line:90%
and then just not convenient.

00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:02.990 align:middle line:84%
So this one have the
property that when

00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I act u on this thing,
and then actually,

00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:09.740 align:middle line:84%
you can just directly
corresponding to the state

00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:13.550 align:middle line:84%
with Lorentz transform
with the momentum.

00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:15.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and then it's very easy.

00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And this property does
not apply to this one.

00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:19.520 align:middle line:90%
It does not apply to this k.

00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:24.560 align:middle line:90%


00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:27.720 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So you can also talk
about a wave packet.

00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:36.210 align:middle line:90%
So this is the plane wave.

00:59:36.210 --> 00:59:38.010 align:middle line:90%
So this is like a plane wave.

00:59:38.010 --> 00:59:40.760 align:middle line:90%
This is a momentum eigenstate.

00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:42.530 align:middle line:84%
So we can also
consider general--

00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:48.370 align:middle line:90%


00:59:48.370 --> 00:59:50.815 align:middle line:84%
say, single particle state
will have the following form.

00:59:50.815 --> 01:00:03.130 align:middle line:90%


01:00:03.130 --> 01:00:04.460 align:middle line:90%
So we have the following form.

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:09.520 align:middle line:84%
We can write it as psi just
as a superposition of this k.

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Again, you only
need to integrate

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:14.440 align:middle line:84%
over spatial momentum, because
only the spatial momentum are

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:16.970 align:middle line:90%
independent.

01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And then some arbitrary function
of k, and then on this k.

01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:23.840 align:middle line:84%
So any single
particle state, you

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.370 align:middle line:84%
should be able to
write it this way.

01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:27.980 align:middle line:90%


01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So in particular, by
choosing appropriate f k,

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:36.905 align:middle line:84%
you can construct a
local wave packet.

01:00:36.905 --> 01:01:09.920 align:middle line:90%


01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:15.800 align:middle line:84%
So you can-- so
choose k-- you can

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:28.295 align:middle line:84%
choose f k to construct a
localized wave packet in space.

01:01:28.295 --> 01:01:37.350 align:middle line:90%


01:01:37.350 --> 01:01:39.690 align:middle line:84%
So again, we will
have some exercises

01:01:39.690 --> 01:01:42.630 align:middle line:90%
like this in your pset 3.

01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:45.510 align:middle line:90%


01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And also earlier, you could
have objected when I called this

01:01:56.250 --> 01:01:57.675 align:middle line:90%
to be a two-particle state.

01:01:57.675 --> 01:02:01.230 align:middle line:90%


01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:03.720 align:middle line:90%
Because each is a plane wave.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.570 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, they
are not localized.

01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:08.400 align:middle line:90%
They cover all space.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And in one sense, they
corresponding to two particles.

01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So now, you can solve
this problem, say,

01:02:16.830 --> 01:02:29.100 align:middle line:84%
by constructing using
d k1 2 pi cube d k2.

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:32.100 align:middle line:90%


01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:40.890 align:middle line:84%
So by choosing appropriate
function k1 k2, this k1 k2,

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:49.935 align:middle line:84%
you can construct two widely
separated wave packets.

01:02:49.935 --> 01:03:00.190 align:middle line:90%


01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's in space, so
you can really talk about--

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:09.450 align:middle line:84%
so these are the genuine
two particle states.

01:03:09.450 --> 01:03:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And so that confirms
actually this k

01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:17.020 align:middle line:84%
should be a interpreted
as the plane wave

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:18.610 align:middle line:84%
version of the two
particle states.

01:03:18.610 --> 01:03:35.260 align:middle line:90%


01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:35.760 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.340 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:39.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.820 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So now that we don't
have a position operator

01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:45.360 align:middle line:84%
like we did before, what's
the conjugate, I guess,

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.270 align:middle line:84%
operator to our momentum
operator, or is there--

01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:49.020 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Good.

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:51.390 align:middle line:90%
That's a very good question.

01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, there will be a problem
in your pset 3 which asks you

01:03:56.790 --> 01:04:01.027 align:middle line:84%
to show there's no eigenstate--
or there's no eigenstate --

01:04:01.027 --> 01:04:01.860 align:middle line:90%
there is no perfect.

01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so in non-relativistic
quantum mechanics,

01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:05.940 align:middle line:90%
you have this state.

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:09.480 align:middle line:84%
You have this wave function, so
you can localize at the point,

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:12.780 align:middle line:84%
but there's no analog
of such kind of state

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:15.780 align:middle line:84%
in the relativistic
case precisely

01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:18.210 align:middle line:84%
because there's no
position operator anymore.

01:04:18.210 --> 01:04:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so you will explore this a
little bit more later yourself.

01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Just with this formalism, you
can explore all these questions

01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:28.210 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:29.020 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:32.125 align:middle line:84%
Actually, you already
have the power to do that.

01:04:32.125 --> 01:04:40.300 align:middle line:90%


01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:43.270 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's say
a little bit more

01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:46.280 align:middle line:84%
on the structure of
the Hilbert space.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.340 align:middle line:84%
So, here the structure
of the Hilbert space

01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:57.800 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit special
because there's no interaction.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:00.400 align:middle line:84%
So you can just
separate it into--

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:04.750 align:middle line:84%
so the full Hilbert space,
which I write as script H.

01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Then, you can separate
it into the vacuum state,

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:11.068 align:middle line:84%
and then you have the one
particle Hilbert space,

01:05:11.068 --> 01:05:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and then you have the two
particle Hilbert space,

01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:13.990 align:middle line:90%
and they're all--

01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:16.030 align:middle line:84%
they don't have anything
to do with each other

01:05:16.030 --> 01:05:17.695 align:middle line:90%
because there's no interaction.

01:05:17.695 --> 01:05:24.200 align:middle line:90%


01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:26.840 align:middle line:84%
So in principle, you can
have infinite number of them.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.640 align:middle line:84%
You can have infinite
number of them.

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you restrict to always
a finite number of particles--

01:05:36.050 --> 01:05:37.550 align:middle line:90%
so the set of states--

01:05:37.550 --> 01:05:42.420 align:middle line:90%


01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:49.470 align:middle line:84%
so this is one particle, this
is two particle, et cetera.

01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:54.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's of states with a
finite number of particles.

01:05:54.140 --> 01:06:03.970 align:middle line:90%


01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:05.095 align:middle line:90%
It's called the Fock space.

01:06:05.095 --> 01:06:13.480 align:middle line:90%


01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:16.240 align:middle line:84%
In the Fock space,
we only have state

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:17.680 align:middle line:90%
of finite number of particles.

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:20.920 align:middle line:84%
One can have arbitrary
number of them--

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.570 align:middle line:90%
as large as you want.

01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:26.485 align:middle line:84%
10 billion, 100 billion,
but it will be finite.

01:06:26.485 --> 01:06:30.850 align:middle line:90%


01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:41.150 align:middle line:90%
So finally, those k--

01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:43.580 align:middle line:84%
either this k or
this k, they are just

01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:46.250 align:middle line:84%
plane wave normalized
because they're

01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:48.330 align:middle line:90%
normalize by delta function.

01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:52.520 align:middle line:84%
So strictly speaking, they
are not normalizable states.

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And so strictly
speaking, they are not

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.780 align:middle line:90%
in the physical Hilbert space.

01:06:56.780 --> 01:07:06.550 align:middle line:84%
So strictly, speaking k or k
or any of those states of k--

01:07:06.550 --> 01:07:10.580 align:middle line:90%
or k1 k2 are not normalizable.

01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:12.410 align:middle line:84%
They are only plane
wave normalizable.

01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:19.820 align:middle line:90%


01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:27.410 align:middle line:84%
So just like-- just as psi
is equal to exponential ik

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:31.970 align:middle line:84%
x in non-relativistic quantum
mechanics is not normalizable.

01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:37.430 align:middle line:90%


01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:41.960 align:middle line:84%
So they're convenient
for various mathematical

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:44.720 align:middle line:84%
operations, but they
don't correspond

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:47.750 align:middle line:90%
to genuine physical states.

01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:51.980 align:middle line:90%
So not genuine physical states.

01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:55.340 align:middle line:90%


01:07:55.340 --> 01:08:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So physical state, we have
to consider for example

01:08:03.330 --> 01:08:05.280 align:middle line:90%
this kind of state.

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And then you choose f k
so that is normalizable.

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:15.380 align:middle line:90%
So if we take this, and then--

01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:22.960 align:middle line:90%


01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:33.529 align:middle line:84%
so with psi, given by that,
then the normalization of psi,

01:08:33.529 --> 01:08:37.670 align:middle line:84%
you can calculate it, and
then this is given by--

01:08:37.670 --> 01:08:41.779 align:middle line:90%


01:08:41.779 --> 01:08:45.750 align:middle line:84%
so you can easily
guess the answer.

01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:47.960 align:middle line:84%
So when you do the
overlap exactly,

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.930 align:middle line:84%
you find that this given by
the modulus of f k squared.

01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:56.050 align:middle line:90%


01:08:56.050 --> 01:08:57.850 align:middle line:84%
So if you do the
calculation to calculate

01:08:57.850 --> 01:09:00.430 align:middle line:84%
the norm of that state, you
find that given by that.

01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:02.859 align:middle line:84%
And then we can choose
this to be finite,

01:09:02.859 --> 01:09:05.650 align:middle line:84%
and then this will be then
will be a normalized state.

01:09:05.650 --> 01:09:14.229 align:middle line:90%


01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:19.210 align:middle line:84%
So for this reason,
it's sometimes--

01:09:19.210 --> 01:09:20.410 align:middle line:90%
we don't do it very often--

01:09:20.410 --> 01:09:22.930 align:middle line:90%


01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:33.905 align:middle line:84%
can choose just a basis
of f x, say, of f i.

01:09:33.905 --> 01:09:36.720 align:middle line:90%


01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:39.300 align:middle line:90%
So i runs some number.

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And then this alpha-- then you
can define alpha i and then

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.000 align:middle line:90%
this will provide--

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:07.290 align:middle line:84%
the alpha i will provide a
basis of the single particle

01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:08.280 align:middle line:90%
normalizable states--

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:11.130 align:middle line:90%


01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:13.150 align:middle line:90%
a single particle state.

01:10:13.150 --> 01:10:18.500 align:middle line:84%
So here is a fun fact related to
the earlier question was asked.

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:23.140 align:middle line:90%
So naively, here, you have--

01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:26.320 align:middle line:90%
if you look at the k--

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:28.000 align:middle line:90%
so k form a basis.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's just look at the
single particle state.

01:10:30.670 --> 01:10:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So naively, this k forms
a continuum-- uncountable

01:10:36.490 --> 01:10:38.140 align:middle line:90%
continuum of basis of states.

01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:41.170 align:middle line:90%


01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:44.710 align:middle line:84%
But once we impose this
normalizable condition,

01:10:44.710 --> 01:10:47.920 align:middle line:84%
means you need to choose
the normalizable f.

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And then you can show the basis
of this normalizable f actually

01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:52.900 align:middle line:90%
is countable.

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:54.750 align:middle line:84%
So in the end, the
Hilbert space--

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:56.910 align:middle line:84%
the one-dimensional the
one particle Hilbert

01:10:56.910 --> 01:11:00.600 align:middle line:84%
space is actually generated
by countable basis

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:03.540 align:middle line:84%
just like in your ordinary
quantum mechanics.

01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:07.860 align:middle line:84%
It's actually rather than
uncountable basis like in k

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.552 align:middle line:84%
once you restrict
normalizability.

01:11:09.552 --> 01:11:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a fun
mathematical fact.

01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:16.450 align:middle line:90%


01:11:16.450 --> 01:11:17.820 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:18.810 align:middle line:90%
Questions on this?

01:11:18.810 --> 01:11:29.450 align:middle line:90%


01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:41.270 align:middle line:84%
So the last few minutes, we
talk about conserved charges.

01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:46.220 align:middle line:90%


01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Quantum-- the role
of conserved charges.

01:11:52.090 --> 01:11:58.480 align:middle line:90%


01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:05.410 align:middle line:84%
So classically, we
say if an action is

01:12:05.410 --> 01:12:07.450 align:middle line:90%
invariant under some symmetry--

01:12:07.450 --> 01:12:10.690 align:middle line:84%
some transformation-- some
continuous transformation,

01:12:10.690 --> 01:12:20.880 align:middle line:84%
say, of the infinitesimal
form, so the alpha are

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.910 align:middle line:90%
the infinitesimal parameters.

01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:27.060 align:middle line:84%
So the alpha label
different transformations,

01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:28.950 align:middle line:90%
and a label different fields.

01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Alpha label different
transformations.

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And then you will get
the conserved current J

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:39.810 align:middle line:84%
mu labeled by this alpha,
so alpha label differently

01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:40.740 align:middle line:90%
for each.

01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:44.970 align:middle line:84%
So alpha label different
symmetries for each symmetry,

01:12:44.970 --> 01:12:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and then you have a
conserved current,

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:51.345 align:middle line:84%
which is satisfy the
J mu alpha equal to 0.

01:12:51.345 --> 01:12:54.590 align:middle line:90%


01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:57.350 align:middle line:84%
The alpha equal to
1, 2, et cetera--

01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:58.940 align:middle line:90%
label different symmetries.

01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:06.800 align:middle line:90%


01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And then you can write
down your Noether current.

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:13.490 align:middle line:84%
So we derive a general formula
for the Noether current

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:16.475 align:middle line:84%
is given by the form,
say, partial L--

01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:19.250 align:middle line:90%


01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:23.446 align:middle line:90%
partial partial mu phi a.

01:13:23.446 --> 01:13:25.040 align:middle line:90%
And then f a alpha.

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.790 align:middle line:84%
So this is essentially
the same as before.

01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, I just add the
index alpha now to label.

01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:32.070 align:middle line:84%
You can have more
than one symmetries.

01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:34.620 align:middle line:90%
And then minus k mu alpha.

01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:38.730 align:middle line:84%
So k mu alpha is
the derivative--

01:13:38.730 --> 01:13:43.410 align:middle line:84%
total derivative -- suppose
-- delta L is given by epsilon

01:13:43.410 --> 01:13:47.280 align:middle line:90%
alpha partial mu k mu alpha.

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So the k mu alpha is the
total derivative corresponding

01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:53.280 align:middle line:90%
to that respect --

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:57.270 align:middle line:84%
corresponding to
that transformation.

01:13:57.270 --> 01:14:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And then the q
alpha, that will be

01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:08.130 align:middle line:84%
the conserved charge for that
current, so zeroth component.

01:14:08.130 --> 01:14:09.810 align:middle line:90%
So this is the classical story.

01:14:09.810 --> 01:14:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm using a little
bit more general notation

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.730 align:middle line:90%
for each alpha.

01:14:15.730 --> 01:14:16.995 align:middle line:90%
So now, the key thing--

01:14:16.995 --> 01:14:21.115 align:middle line:90%


01:14:21.115 --> 01:14:23.240 align:middle line:84%
so now the key thing is
that at the quantum level--

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:34.768 align:middle line:90%


01:14:34.768 --> 01:14:35.810 align:middle line:90%
so at the quantum level--

01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:43.910 align:middle line:90%


01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:45.500 align:middle line:84%
first, as we already
seen in the case

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:48.320 align:middle line:84%
of the Hamiltonian and
the momentum operator,

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.640 align:middle line:90%
so q alpha is time independent--

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.170 align:middle line:90%
is a constant operator.

01:14:54.170 --> 01:15:00.260 align:middle line:90%


01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:03.050 align:middle line:84%
So this is the fact
that this is conserved.

01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:08.350 align:middle line:90%


01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And also another
important property of q

01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:19.520 align:middle line:84%
is that when you act
q alpha on your field,

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:22.255 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the commutator
between this q alpha

01:15:22.255 --> 01:15:27.560 align:middle line:84%
on your field, it
actually generates

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:30.760 align:middle line:90%
finite transformation.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:40.480 align:middle line:84%
So turns out-- yeah,
so if we have put

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:42.325 align:middle line:84%
a parameter here--
epsilon alpha.

01:15:42.325 --> 01:15:45.190 align:middle line:90%


01:15:45.190 --> 01:15:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so it doesn't
matter for Q--

01:15:47.770 --> 01:15:50.680 align:middle line:90%
say, it's upstairs, downstairs.

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:51.715 align:middle line:90%
And then you get--

01:15:51.715 --> 01:15:56.060 align:middle line:90%


01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:59.150 align:middle line:84%
so you just generate the
transformation for f--

01:15:59.150 --> 01:16:01.280 align:middle line:90%
for phi.

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.120 align:middle line:90%
So this can be shown explicitly.

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:05.900 align:middle line:90%


01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:08.520 align:middle line:90%
So you can show this explicitly.

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:10.260 align:middle line:90%
We're running out of time now.

01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:14.540 align:middle line:84%
So you can show explicitly
just using this expression.

01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:20.310 align:middle line:84%
So let me just quickly
outline the way to do it.

01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:21.995 align:middle line:90%
So if you, say--

01:16:21.995 --> 01:16:26.510 align:middle line:90%


01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:31.956 align:middle line:84%
so let's look at the
zeroth component of this J.

01:16:31.956 --> 01:16:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So the zeroth component of
the J just equal to partial L,

01:16:46.530 --> 01:16:52.155 align:middle line:84%
partial, partial, 0
phi a and f a alpha.

01:16:52.155 --> 01:16:55.200 align:middle line:90%


01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.700 align:middle line:90%
So let's consider the--

01:16:56.700 --> 01:17:00.300 align:middle line:90%


01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:04.080 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I think today we will
not have time to finish anyway.

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let's just leave
this to the next time.

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let me just say
that the quantum level,

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:15.160 align:middle line:84%
this will generate the
infinitesimal transformation.

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
also exponentiate

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:24.930 align:middle line:84%
this Q. You can introduce,
say, exponential i lambda Q.

01:17:24.930 --> 01:17:28.620 align:middle line:84%
So if q is the
conserved charge--

01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:32.460 align:middle line:84%
and then you can
exponentiate Q like this.

01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And then this operator
then generates--

01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:45.970 align:middle line:84%
when it acts on
phi, then generates

01:17:45.970 --> 01:17:47.380 align:middle line:90%
finite transformations.

01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:58.960 align:middle line:90%


01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.050 align:middle line:84%
So this takes you
to phi a prime--

01:18:02.050 --> 01:18:03.400 align:middle line:90%
the finite transformations.

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so in your
pset, for pset 2,

01:18:07.450 --> 01:18:12.290 align:middle line:84%
you actually check yourself
a couple of simple examples,

01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:15.800 align:middle line:90%
and you will see this works.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And in the next lecture, we will
give you a simple derivation

01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:23.620 align:middle line:90%
to show this actually works.

01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:25.740 align:middle line:90%
It works in general.

01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:31.000 align:middle line:90%
