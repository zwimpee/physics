00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.820 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: So first,
I'll try to remind you

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.040 align:middle line:84%
what we did at the
end of last lecture

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.280 align:middle line:90%
which was last Wednesday.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And so we introduced
these things

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.170 align:middle line:84%
called the Grassmann variables
which are anticommuting.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Classically, they anticommute--
so for example, if you have,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.940 align:middle line:84%
say, a quantity called
theta, and then theta 0--

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.400 align:middle line:90%
theta squared equal to 0.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And then two such kind
of Grassmann variables

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.655 align:middle line:84%
commute with-- anticommute
with each other.

00:00:44.655 --> 00:00:48.660 align:middle line:90%


00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And then if you consider
a function of such theta,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.140 align:middle line:84%
then you just do a
Taylor expansion,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.620 align:middle line:90%
and you only have two terms.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.505 align:middle line:84%
So the first term is a
constant, and the second term

00:00:59.505 --> 00:01:02.550 align:middle line:84%
is proportional to theta,
because all higher power

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.950 align:middle line:90%
terms vanish.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.350 align:middle line:84%
So the same thing with
a multiple variable--

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.770 align:middle line:84%
just expand until you reach
the square of any variable.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And then you can do
a differentiation.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.120 align:middle line:84%
So we always define the
differentiation from the left.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.070 align:middle line:90%
So this is given by f1.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And we can also define
the integration,

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and the integration is
determined by two rules.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:45.140 align:middle line:84%
The first rule is d theta,
a constant equal to 0,

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.670 align:middle line:84%
and, also, d theta
theta equal to 1.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, so based on
these two rules--

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.770 align:middle line:84%
and then you can just work out
the integral of any functions.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.960 align:middle line:90%


00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.400 align:middle line:84%
So before I proceed, do you
have any questions on this?

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.530 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.800 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.380 align:middle line:84%
So for multivariable
function, you just expand.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Say, for example, if
you have two variables,

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:32.370 align:middle line:84%
then you just have f0 plus f1
theta 1 plus f2 theta 2 plus

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.170 align:middle line:90%
f1,2 theta 1 theta 2.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.660 align:middle line:84%
So we can also
define the integra--

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.830 align:middle line:84%
yeah, the differentiation
of a multivariable

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.040 align:middle line:90%
function-- more easy.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.910 align:middle line:84%
You just be a little bit
careful of the direction

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.920 align:middle line:90%
you take the derivative.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's look at the
example of the integration.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:01.200 align:middle line:90%


00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.100 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's look at the integral
of a function of two variables.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So you should keep in mind
that this order is important

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.510 align:middle line:84%
because theta 1 and
theta 2 are anticommute.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.950 align:middle line:84%
So if we write d theta 1
and d theta 2, then it is d

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.570 align:middle line:90%
theta 1 d theta 2.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.300 align:middle line:84%
It's equal to minus
d theta 2 d theta 1.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.380 align:middle line:90%
You want to change the order.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.150 align:middle line:84%
So we can just do the
integration by using this rule.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:41.620 align:middle line:84%
You just plug in this
expansion into here,

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and then, obviously,
all these three

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.345 align:middle line:90%
will give you 0 because of the--

00:03:48.345 --> 00:03:52.940 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.420 align:middle line:84%
and only the last
term will contribute.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And then you just get f1,2,
then d theta 1 d theta 2,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.070 align:middle line:90%
then theta 1 times theta 2.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.700 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So now if you want to do the
integration, because theta 2

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.649 align:middle line:90%
is before the theta here.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Theta 2 is closer, and the
theta 2 before theta 1--

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.910 align:middle line:84%
and then you need
to change the order.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.730 align:middle line:84%
So we can do it by
doing f1,2 d theta 1,

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and then you have d theta
2 integral, theta 2,

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.730 align:middle line:90%
and then theta 1.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Now we have changed the
order of theta 1 theta 2,

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.220 align:middle line:90%
and this gives me 1.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.560 align:middle line:90%
So after this, it gives me 1.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.520 align:middle line:90%
This also gives me 1.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.630 align:middle line:84%
So this is just
equal to minus f1,2.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So similarly, you can just do
an arbitrary number of integrals

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.680 align:middle line:90%
with--

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:84%
you can just do integrals
with an arbitrary

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.400 align:middle line:90%
number of variables.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Just keep in mind that d theta
1 d theta 2 theta 2 theta 1--

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.200 align:middle line:90%
this is equal to 1.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.440 align:middle line:84%
So you do this first,
and then you do that,

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.960 align:middle line:84%
and then you get
the right order.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.010 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.120 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Here, f0 and f1,
are those complex numbers,

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.130 align:middle line:90%
or Grassmann numbers, or both?

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.950 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Here, we just take
them to be ordinary numbers.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.450 align:middle line:84%
So they can just
be complex numbers.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.457 align:middle line:90%
That's right, yeah.

00:05:25.457 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:90%


00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.310 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.760 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.040 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.210 align:middle line:84%
So now we can look at a little
bit more complicated integral.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.090 align:middle line:84%
So now let's look
at the Gaussian.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:51.790 align:middle line:90%


00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.830 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at such
a Gaussian integral.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.920 align:middle line:90%


00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.950 align:middle line:84%
So this Gaussian integral
looks complicated,

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.210 align:middle line:90%
but, of course, it's simple.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Because again, this
is when you expand it.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.020 align:middle line:90%
There's only a single term left.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.060 align:middle line:84%
So this is just equal
to d theta 1 d theta 2,

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.120 align:middle line:90%
and then 1 minus this guy.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so theta 1 a1,2 theta 2.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Because the next term, when
you do the Taylor expansion,

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:22.780 align:middle line:90%
will give you 0.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.770 align:middle line:90%
A little bit.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.630 align:middle line:84%
So that will involve the theta
1 square or theta 2 square.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And now if you use this
rule, you just get a1,2.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And so you can now generalize
two Gaussian integrals

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.980 align:middle line:84%
with an arbitrary
number of variables.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And so we can write a more
general integral, d theta 1 d

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:03.390 align:middle line:90%
theta 2 n, because they--

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:84%
so minus 1/2 theta
i a ij theta j.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.970 align:middle line:84%
So now here, you should
assume i and j are summed.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:18.160 align:middle line:90%
OK, so ij is from 1 to 2n.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:25.490 align:middle line:90%


00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.340 align:middle line:84%
So for this integral, again,
the strategy is simple.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:36.080 align:middle line:84%
You just, again, expand it
and then just do term by term.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.920 align:middle line:84%
So at a certain time when you
expand to a certain order,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.790 align:middle line:84%
the theta will repeat and
then the expansion truncates.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.340 align:middle line:84%
But you can actually
easily convince yourself

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:53.720 align:middle line:84%
without doing any calculation
to see what the answer is.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:59.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't expand to a
sufficient number of theta,

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:05.290 align:middle line:84%
you will get 0 because you have
to have each theta for d theta

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.480 align:middle line:90%
in order for this rule.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.290 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have one
theta for each d theta.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:15.160 align:middle line:84%
So that means you have to expand
to the order which each theta

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.070 align:middle line:90%
just appears exactly once.

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.623 align:middle line:90%
And then if you do that--

00:08:19.623 --> 00:08:21.040 align:middle line:84%
if you look at
that term, you find

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:27.920 align:middle line:84%
that this just gives you
square root determinant aij

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.925 align:middle line:90%
determinant a.

00:08:30.925 --> 00:08:32.580 align:middle line:84%
You find this
actually gives you--

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:41.770 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.003 align:middle line:84%
here, a is an
antisymmetric matrix--

00:08:44.003 --> 00:08:45.670 align:middle line:84%
by definition, it
should be anti-- yeah,

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.590 align:middle line:84%
because theta i and
theta j are anticommute.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.975 align:middle line:84%
So a ij should be an
antisymmetric matrix.

00:08:49.975 --> 00:09:08.090 align:middle line:90%


00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.365 align:middle line:90%
OK, any questions on this?

00:09:09.365 --> 00:09:13.320 align:middle line:90%


00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.410 align:middle line:84%
So this looks like
standard Gaussian integral.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Remember the standard
Gaussian integral.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.420 align:middle line:90%
What would you get?

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.480 align:middle line:84%
If you have such kind
of quadratic structure

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.170 align:middle line:84%
for the standard Gaussian
integral, for ordinary numbers,

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.000 align:middle line:90%
do you remember what you get?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.760 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's like 2 pi
to some power over [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.440 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:36.980 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:42.050 align:middle line:84%
So if theta are
ordinary variables,

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.660 align:middle line:84%
then you will get
some constant divided

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.940 align:middle line:90%
by square root of determinant a.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.940 align:middle line:84%
But for the Grassmann
number, you just solve it,

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and you get the proportional to
the determinant-- not divided

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.704 align:middle line:90%
by the determinant.

00:09:54.704 --> 00:09:58.970 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Good, so we can also introduce
complex Grassmann variables.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:14.520 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.370 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, I can introduce
theta over the square root

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.270 align:middle line:90%
2, theta 1 plus i theta 2.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.160 align:middle line:84%
So theta 1 and theta
2 are considered

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.170 align:middle line:84%
to be 2 real
Grassmann variables.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:33.280 align:middle line:84%
i is just ordinary i,
and then the theta star

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:38.620 align:middle line:84%
would be, of course, the theta
square root 2 theta 1 minus i

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.410 align:middle line:90%
theta 2.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And so the rule for
defining the product--

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:48.040 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.870 align:middle line:84%
the complex conjugation
for the product--

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:54.850 align:middle line:84%
is defined to be
eta star theta star.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.620 align:middle line:84%
So this is different from
the ordinary variables.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is defined more
like for an operator.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.380 align:middle line:84%
So for Grassmann
variables, when we

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:07.120 align:middle line:84%
define the complex conjugate,
we actually change the order--

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:12.790 align:middle line:84%
as well, what we normally do
for a Hermitian conjugate.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:16.900 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you have a
function, say, theta theta

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:21.710 align:middle line:84%
star, with theta now a complex
of Grassmann variables,

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:23.680 align:middle line:90%
you just do the same thing.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:33.320 align:middle line:84%
So you have c0 plus c1 theta
plus c1 bar theta star,

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:38.330 align:middle line:90%
then plus c1,1 theta theta star.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:42.380 align:middle line:84%
So again, you're just
expanding theta and theta star.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you truncate here,
because the further terms

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.100 align:middle line:84%
will involve either theta
square or theta star square.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:54.290 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.290 --> 00:12:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So here, for the integration,
we define d theta d

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:05.150 align:middle line:84%
theta star and then
theta star theta to be 1.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.760 align:middle line:90%
So we choose this convention.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:14.720 align:middle line:90%


00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.760 align:middle line:90%
So we define this to be what?

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's corresponding to a
specific choice of a measure

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:21.620 align:middle line:90%
for this d theta d theta star.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.710 align:middle line:90%


00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:25.210 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.745 align:middle line:84%
So now we can look at the
complex Gaussian integral.

00:12:27.745 --> 00:12:32.330 align:middle line:90%


00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.840 align:middle line:90%
OK, now let's look at Gaussian.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:43.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you have d
theta star d theta,

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:48.970 align:middle line:84%
say, exponential minus
theta star b theta--

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:52.270 align:middle line:84%
so b is just some number--
some arbitrary number.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And again, you can just do it by
expanding this in power series.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And just as in that
example, you just

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.346 align:middle line:90%
find that this is equal to b.

00:13:01.346 --> 00:13:06.580 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And you can also now
do multiple variables--

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:15.000 align:middle line:90%
so multiple variable Gaussian.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So suppose you have now j
equal to 1 to n d theta j star

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.280 align:middle line:90%
d theta j--

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.090 align:middle line:90%
the product of all of them.

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:40.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you have minus theta
i star A ij theta j--

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:45.110 align:middle line:84%
again, i and the j should
be assumed to be summed.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
expand it, again, you

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:53.470 align:middle line:90%
expand precisely to the order--

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:58.030 align:middle line:84%
only one term in the
expansion contribute.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:01.240 align:middle line:84%
It's the expansion in
which each theta and theta

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.670 align:middle line:90%
star appear exactly once.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.520 align:middle line:84%
So when you look
at that term, you

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:12.320 align:middle line:84%
find that this precisely
gives you det A.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.840 align:middle line:84%
So again, this,
should be contrasted

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.630 align:middle line:90%
with the complex integral--

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.850 align:middle line:84%
ordinary complex
Gaussian integral.

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an
ordinary Gaussian integral

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.310 align:middle line:84%
for complex
variables, again, you

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.650 align:middle line:84%
will get 1 over
determinant A. It's

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:29.420 align:middle line:84%
some constant over
determinant A.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So for Grassmann, you
just get determinant A.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And this feature is very key
in distinguishing fermions

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:44.180 align:middle line:84%
and the bosons, and plays
a very important role.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.590 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:53.680 align:middle line:84%
So we can also consider
more general integrals,

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.570 align:middle line:84%
more general Gaussian
integrals like this.

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:58.610 align:middle line:84%
So now, let me just introduce
a little bit of notation.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:07.760 align:middle line:84%
So let me call the theta equal
to theta 1 theta, say, n.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.010 align:middle line:90%
Let me introduce eta.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Eta is some other Grassmann
variables, eta 1 eta n.

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And then we can
consider an integral

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:84%
like this which
we will encounter.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Later, we will encounter
integrals like this.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Again, d theta
star j d theta j--

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:45.130 align:middle line:84%
then you have exponential,
so minus theta dagger.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:48.100 align:middle line:84%
So now, the dagger is
including both the transpose

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.560 align:middle line:90%
and taking the star.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.260 align:middle line:90%
And A, now, is just the matrix.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Again, just write this
in the matrix notation.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.530 align:middle line:84%
But now, suppose that here I
only have a quadratic term.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:84%
But suppose now I have
some linear term--

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:09.890 align:middle line:84%
say, eta dagger theta
and theta dagger eta.

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:11.180 align:middle line:90%
OK, suppose now I have this.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.470 align:middle line:90%


00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And again, you can just
complete the square

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:21.700 align:middle line:84%
through the Grassmann version
of the complete-- the square.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.385 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
convince yourself

00:16:25.385 --> 00:16:27.550 align:middle line:90%
that this is given by det A--

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:30.660 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.735 align:middle line:90%
determinant of A-- matrix A--

00:16:33.735 --> 00:16:45.440 align:middle line:84%
and then exponential eta
dagger A minus 1 eta.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:51.160 align:middle line:84%
So up to the sign
and i, et cetera--

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.130 align:middle line:84%
this is exactly what
you'd normally expect

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:55.400 align:middle line:90%
after you complete the square.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.510 align:middle line:84%
You get A minus 1 here,
and then you get this eta.

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:01.360 align:middle line:90%


00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.770 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:03.998 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:03.998 --> 00:17:06.569 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is A
still antisymmetric?

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:08.569 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: It does not
have to be antisymmetric.

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:09.069 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:14.220 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.965 align:middle line:84%
So it can be some complex
matrix, in principle.

00:17:16.965 --> 00:17:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Yeah-- some general
complex matrix.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:29.290 align:middle line:84%
So I will also denote this
by I eta and eta star.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:40.000 align:middle line:90%


00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we only need
the one last formula,

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:47.380 align:middle line:84%
and then we can
talk about the path

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:51.820 align:middle line:90%
integral for the Dirac fields.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.460 align:middle line:84%
So one last formula
is that we, say--

00:17:55.460 --> 00:18:03.390 align:middle line:84%
let's try to calculate
the following integral--

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:07.128 align:middle line:90%
1 over I0,0.

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:09.480 align:middle line:84%
OK, I0,0 means
just this integral.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Just this integral is I0,0
with both eta equal to zero.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.400 align:middle line:90%
So 1 over I0,0--

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:22.524 align:middle line:84%
suppose let's consider this
integral, j from 1 to n

00:18:22.524 --> 00:18:27.440 align:middle line:90%
d theta j star d theta j.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Now suppose we
have theta k star--

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:36.580 align:middle line:84%
theta k-- and theta
l star in downstairs,

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.830 align:middle line:84%
and then you have
the exponential minus

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:41.705 align:middle line:90%
theta dagger A theta.

00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:43.330 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you have an
integral like this.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.798 align:middle line:90%


00:18:45.798 --> 00:18:48.090 align:middle line:84%
So the integral like this
can be obtained from this one

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:49.330 align:middle line:90%
by taking derivatives.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is like a
generating functional.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.370 align:middle line:84%
So then this can be
considered as 1 over--

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:57.360 align:middle line:84%
yeah, let me just
suppress these two zeros--

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:08.740 align:middle line:84%
1 over I. This can have minus
partial partial eta star k,

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.610 align:middle line:90%
and then yeah--

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:16.630 align:middle line:90%
partial partial l.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:22.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, then take derivative
on I eta and eta star--

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:25.102 align:middle line:84%
taking derivative
on this, and then

00:19:25.102 --> 00:19:27.310 align:middle line:84%
after you take the derivative
on each side of the eta

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:28.810 align:middle line:90%
equal to eta star equal to 0.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:32.190 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.160 align:middle line:84%
So when you take
these two derivatives,

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:39.600 align:middle line:84%
you can see that we bring
down the theta k and theta l.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And this sign-- just make sure
you get the sign correctly.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And then when you do
this derivative here--

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:53.088 align:middle line:84%
and then you find that this
is given by A minus 1 kl.

00:19:53.088 --> 00:19:58.630 align:middle line:90%


00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:02.062 align:middle line:84%
So this is actually the
same as the bosonic case.

00:20:02.062 --> 00:20:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Remember, in the bosonic
case, if you have a Gaussian

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:06.760 align:middle line:84%
integral, and if
you have the two

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.860 align:middle line:84%
variables in the
downstairs, then

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:13.430 align:middle line:84%
that gives you the inverse of
the matrix up to a constant.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this aspect is actually
similar to the bosonic case.

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:22.110 align:middle line:90%
So do you have any questions?

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:23.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:25.635 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Sorry if I missed it,
but is there a name for that i?

00:20:25.635 --> 00:20:30.142 align:middle line:90%


00:20:30.142 --> 00:20:31.350 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Just the integral.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.880 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: OK, it's
just that integral?

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.650 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:37.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, just a shorthand notation.

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can call it
the generating function.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this is a
generating function

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:47.170 align:middle line:84%
for arbitrary powers of
this kind of integral,

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.750 align:middle line:90%
because any powers of theta--

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.700 align:middle line:84%
any combination of
theta k, et cetera,

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:57.570 align:middle line:84%
you can just obtain by taking
derivative on this I. Yeah,

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.070 align:middle line:90%
mm-hmm.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:06.887 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:06.887 --> 00:21:07.970 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you can--

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:14.450 align:middle line:90%


00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:18.487 align:middle line:90%
here, the complex conjugate--

00:21:18.487 --> 00:21:20.570 align:middle line:84%
in some sense, they are
independent of each other.

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they are
independent variables.

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:25.730 align:middle line:84%
Theta and theta star, because
they depend on two variables--

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.421 align:middle line:84%
and you can just view them
as independent variables.

00:21:28.421 --> 00:21:31.510 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.220 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:39.190 align:middle line:84%
So now, finally, we
have the preparation

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.365 align:middle line:84%
to do the path integral
for the Dirac fields.

00:21:41.365 --> 00:21:52.490 align:middle line:90%


00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:56.480 align:middle line:84%
So remember, Dirac
fields is a vector--

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.690 align:middle line:84%
a spinor field with
four components.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:04.760 align:middle line:90%


00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.500 align:middle line:84%
There's four components,
and they depend

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.150 align:middle line:90%
on space-time coordinates.

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:11.550 align:middle line:90%


00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So normally, we just say this
is the ordinary functions.

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:24.320 align:middle line:84%
But now, in order
to correctly capture

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.290 align:middle line:84%
the fermionic nature
of the Dirac fields,

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:33.050 align:middle line:90%
I now require that psi alpha x.

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:35.750 align:middle line:90%
So alpha is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Take values as
Grassmann numbers.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:52.900 align:middle line:90%


00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.710 align:middle line:90%
So what this means--

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:58.540 align:middle line:84%
so x is still our
ordinary coordinate.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:02.640 align:middle line:84%
For any choice of
space-time location, x--

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.520 align:middle line:84%
so this psi alpha gives
give you a Grassmann number.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And just for any choice of
x, this just means that.

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is a function from an
ordinary space-time variable

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.480 align:middle line:84%
to the space of the
Grassmann numbers.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.930 align:middle line:90%


00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, this means
that psi alpha x psi beta y--

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.590 align:middle line:90%
they anticommute.

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:38.040 align:middle line:90%


00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.990 align:middle line:90%
So this is the rule.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:84%
So now, that's the
only difference.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And now we can just
do the path integral.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:51.145 align:middle line:84%
So the path integral is just
completely parallel as before.

00:23:51.145 --> 00:23:54.620 align:middle line:90%


00:23:54.620 --> 00:24:10.870 align:middle line:84%
So otherwise, exactly the
same as before for what we

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:13.690 align:middle line:90%
did before for a scalar field.

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:18.160 align:middle line:84%
So the only difference is now
the things are integrating.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.070 align:middle line:90%


00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:25.730 align:middle line:84%
So in particular, we can write
any correlation functions.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.550 align:middle line:90%


00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:34.870 align:middle line:84%
So, for example,
again, let's use

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:38.620 align:middle line:84%
omega to denote
the vacuum state.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And the time-ordered
correlation function--

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.840 align:middle line:84%
the x denotes some
product of operators.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, our previous notation--

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:52.400 align:middle line:84%
and the omega-- and
divide it by omega.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:57.520 align:middle line:84%
So this has a path integral
in the present description

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:04.530 align:middle line:84%
in terms of psi bar D psi,
and then x in the integrand,

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and then exponential i S. And
then so everything is exactly

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.700 align:middle line:84%
the same as before,
except the variables

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:25.550 align:middle line:84%
that you are integrating
now are Grassmann variables,

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:28.820 align:middle line:84%
and the S is just
whatever your action is.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:35.575 align:middle line:84%
So let me explain a little
bit this notation, psi.

00:25:35.575 --> 00:25:38.470 align:middle line:90%


00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:44.530 align:middle line:84%
So D psi just means
you have, first, you

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:53.590 align:middle line:84%
have alpha from 1 to 4, and then
you have D psi alpha t and x.

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And this notation is
exactly the same as before.

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:59.440 align:middle line:84%
When I write D psi, you
should imagine I take

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.660 align:middle line:90%
the product of all components.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And then for each of them,
it's just exactly the same

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:09.130 align:middle line:84%
as we do for the bosonic
field definition.

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:12.100 align:middle line:84%
The only difference is that now
this is Grassmann variables.

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:15.040 align:middle line:90%


00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:26.230 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, also, the x here is,
say, some product of psi's--

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:27.850 align:middle line:90%
so arbitrary product of psis--

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:31.000 align:middle line:90%


00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.450 align:middle line:84%
then everything
previous takes over.

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:36.160 align:middle line:84%
You can just write
down the expression.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.400 align:middle line:90%


00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:43.540 align:middle line:84%
So again, in order to do
calculations-- for example,

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.600 align:middle line:84%
to calculate the
propagator, et cetera--

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.450 align:middle line:84%
it's convenient to use
the generating functional

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:51.750 align:middle line:84%
as we do here for this
Gaussian integral.

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's convenient to introduce
this generating functional eta

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:01.510 align:middle line:90%
eta bar.

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:08.870 align:middle line:84%
So this is defined to
be the D psi bar D psi.

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
exponential i s,

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:22.870 align:middle line:84%
and then you write, say,
eta bar psi psi bar eta.

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:27.470 align:middle line:84%
So again, when you
take derivative of eta,

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:30.810 align:middle line:84%
then you can bring down the
powers of psi of psi bar.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And then you use as a trick
if you know this one--

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.775 align:middle line:84%
and then you can
just calculate any x.

00:27:37.775 --> 00:27:43.180 align:middle line:90%


00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.100 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.259 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:46.259 --> 00:27:57.233 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:57.233 --> 00:27:57.900 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:12.540 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:14.110 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:17.300 align:middle line:90%
No, you don't need to--

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.560 align:middle line:84%
you can view this
as a definition.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.420 align:middle line:90%


00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.120 align:middle line:84%
We just carry over what
you used as the definition.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.730 align:middle line:84%
We carry over what
we did before,

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:30.440 align:middle line:84%
and then we just
replace everything

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.058 align:middle line:90%
by Grassmann variables.

00:28:32.058 --> 00:28:41.820 align:middle line:90%


00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:42.850 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:45.650 align:middle line:90%
Any other questions?

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:47.510 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:52.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's just try to
calculate this in free theory.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:56.880 align:middle line:84%
So in the free theory, we
will eventually consider the--

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.640 align:middle line:84%
so far, we just consider
the Dirac theory.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:04.620 align:middle line:84%
So let's just first
consider Dirac theory.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.480 align:middle line:90%
So this is general.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.040 align:middle line:90%
This is completely general.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.220 align:middle line:84%
S can be anything, but
for the Dirac theory,

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:15.450 align:middle line:90%
we have S0 is equal to minus i.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:24.850 align:middle line:90%


00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:28.120 align:middle line:84%
So for the Dirac
theory, it's simple,

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.970 align:middle line:84%
because it's just
quadratic in psi,

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:33.400 align:middle line:84%
and then we just have a
Gaussian integral here.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:46.070 align:middle line:90%


00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:49.520 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing to
do is to write, again,

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.940 align:middle line:90%
this as a form of a matrix.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.960 align:middle line:84%
So we have already
done this before.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:01.730 align:middle line:84%
So this has just
become i d4x d4y,

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:10.750 align:middle line:84%
and then you have psi bar
alpha x A alpha beta x minus y

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:13.600 align:middle line:90%
psi beta y.

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:17.980 align:middle line:90%
So this A alpha beta x minus y--

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.700 align:middle line:84%
this is a matrix both
in the spinor space

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.640 align:middle line:84%
and in the space of
ordinary function--

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.680 align:middle line:90%
in the space of functions.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:34.910 align:middle line:90%
So this is x minus y slash y.

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this means you
take derivative on y.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.490 align:middle line:90%


00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:43.110 align:middle line:84%
So once you write
it in this form--

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:46.260 align:middle line:84%
and then, again, we have this
just in the Gaussian form.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:49.230 align:middle line:84%
So now this path integral is
just in the Gaussian form.

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And, again, we can just
generalize what we did before.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Just keep in mind
that those integrals--

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.790 align:middle line:84%
now this is given
by determinant A,

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:04.050 align:middle line:90%
and then we just find that the--

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:09.240 align:middle line:84%
so, for example,
now this Z eta--

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.520 align:middle line:90%
Z0.

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.870 align:middle line:84%
So this means that we
can see the Dirac theory.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:18.960 align:middle line:84%
So this just can be
directly evaluated,

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:22.230 align:middle line:84%
and then this is given
by determinant A.

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:24.900 align:middle line:84%
So now this determinant
should be understood as

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:30.420 align:middle line:84%
both in the spinor space and
in the space of functions.

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and then we have
the analog of this term,

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:46.830 align:middle line:84%
and then we have exponential
eta bar, then dot D.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:53.110 align:middle line:84%
So I denote the A minus
1 as D in the motivation.

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:56.240 align:middle line:90%
And then the D--

00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:06.270 align:middle line:84%
so this should be considered as
a shorthand notation for this.

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:08.570 align:middle line:84%
So this should be
considered as--

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:10.228 align:middle line:90%
let me just write it here.

00:32:10.228 --> 00:32:12.020 align:middle line:84%
So this should be
considered as a shorthand

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:27.930 align:middle line:84%
notation for d4x d4y eta bar
alpha x D0 alpha beta x minus y

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:30.840 align:middle line:90%
eta beta y.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So this thing is a
shorthand notation for this.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And this D alpha
beta 0 x minus y

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:50.380 align:middle line:84%
is just the inverse
of this matrix A.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.940 align:middle line:84%
You just should view it as
an inverse of the matrix A.

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
same thing as what

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.510 align:middle line:84%
we did in the bosonic
case, and this will be

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:01.760 align:middle line:90%
corresponding to the Feynman.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Using the same
argument, you can show

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:07.010 align:middle line:84%
that this is corresponding
to the Feynman propagator--

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:12.020 align:middle line:90%
time-ordered propagator of psi.

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:16.630 align:middle line:90%


00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:17.770 align:middle line:90%
So everything is similar.

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:19.714 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:19.714 --> 00:33:22.593 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:22.593 --> 00:33:23.260 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:26.165 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:26.165 --> 00:33:29.380 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
you can just view--

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.882 align:middle line:90%


00:33:31.882 --> 00:33:33.930 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to think
about gamma 0 here.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.400 align:middle line:84%
You can just think
about the psi--

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.620 align:middle line:84%
eta bar just as an
independent variable of eta.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:40.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:41.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:46.030 align:middle line:84%
You can just treat it as
some independent variable.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.734 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:47.734 --> 00:33:52.180 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Are we treating eta as
a vector of Grassman variables?

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:55.423 align:middle line:90%


00:33:55.423 --> 00:33:56.715 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: No, eta is Grassman.

00:33:56.715 --> 00:33:59.930 align:middle line:90%


00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, eta is Grassman.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, eta
depends on space time

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.320 align:middle line:84%
because we want to be
able to take a derivative

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.969 align:middle line:90%
to get the psi x.

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:14.860 align:middle line:90%
And so there are--

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.115 align:middle line:90%
yeah, eta has the same--

00:34:16.115 --> 00:34:18.699 align:middle line:90%


00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:23.739 align:middle line:90%
the eta is the eta 1x eta 4x.

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:28.000 align:middle line:90%


00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.732 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, same with eta bar.

00:34:29.732 --> 00:34:30.232 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:30.232 --> 00:34:45.270 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:47.469 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Sorry, say it again.

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:51.670 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Are integrals always
complex numbers at the end?

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:52.790 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:55.760 align:middle line:84%
The integrals are
just some functions

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:59.510 align:middle line:90%
of the Grassmann variables.

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:01.788 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just some functions
of Grassman variables.

00:35:01.788 --> 00:35:06.950 align:middle line:90%


00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:09.410 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And then from here,
from this expression,

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:18.822 align:middle line:84%
you can just find
all the correlation

00:35:18.822 --> 00:35:20.030 align:middle line:90%
functions in the free theory.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:22.630 align:middle line:90%


00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:28.350 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, let me just
quickly write it here.

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:32.250 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have-- yeah, I
think there is not enough space.

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:33.583 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:33.583 --> 00:35:35.625 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: You said that
the result of integrating

00:35:35.625 --> 00:35:38.620 align:middle line:84%
over a Grassmann variable is
another Grassmann variable,

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:39.120 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.985 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:42.985 --> 00:35:43.860 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: No, no no.

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.770 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be.

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:47.570 align:middle line:90%
It depends on the situation.

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:49.550 align:middle line:90%
Here, you get a constant.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Here, you get the function
of a Grassman variable.

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:54.032 align:middle line:84%
It just depends
on the situation.

00:35:54.032 --> 00:35:54.740 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:35:54.740 --> 00:36:00.080 align:middle line:84%
So in the path integral,
it'll all work out

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.310 align:middle line:90%
to give a C number at the end.

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:03.500 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: It depends.

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:05.650 align:middle line:90%
If you have eta--

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:08.355 align:middle line:84%
so if you don't have eta,
then you get a C number.

00:36:08.355 --> 00:36:11.650 align:middle line:90%


00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:14.500 align:middle line:84%
But here, if you have eta, then
you get the function of eta.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.940 align:middle line:90%
And eta are Grassmann variables.

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:17.914 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, mm-hmm.

00:36:17.914 --> 00:36:20.820 align:middle line:90%


00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:21.570 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:28.950 align:middle line:84%
So now, you can just obtain
any correlation functions

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:29.890 align:middle line:90%
in Dirac theory.

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:32.730 align:middle line:84%
You can just take
derivative with respect

00:36:32.730 --> 00:37:01.280 align:middle line:84%
to this Z. So, say,
psi x1 psi xn 0--

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.470 align:middle line:84%
and, again, with the
previous convention,

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:07.430 align:middle line:84%
always use 0 to denote the
vacuum of the free theory

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and then use this omega
to denote the vacuum,

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:14.270 align:middle line:84%
say, if you have
interaction theory.

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:16.890 align:middle line:90%


00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, you just get
Z0 with eta set to be 0,

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and then you just
do derivatives.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.130 align:middle line:90%
Up to a sign--

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:42.650 align:middle line:84%
just delta eta x1
delta eta xn, and then

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:51.510 align:middle line:84%
you take derivative
on this Z. Yeah,

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:54.970 align:middle line:84%
so it depends on whether you
do the bar or not the bar.

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:57.690 align:middle line:84%
So, for example,
here is the bar.

00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:00.390 align:middle line:90%
So here, psi-- yeah.

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And if it's sub psi, then you
take derivative with eta bar.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:07.080 align:middle line:84%
If it's psi bar, you
take derivative with eta.

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, and then you do psi
eta equal to eta bar equals 0--

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:14.430 align:middle line:90%
exactly the same as before.

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And then again, because these
have this kind of structure,

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:24.786 align:middle line:84%
you always pair
eta bar with eta--

00:38:24.786 --> 00:38:27.130 align:middle line:90%
with D-- in here.

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:33.150 align:middle line:84%
So when you do that, you just
get all possible contractions--

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:35.400 align:middle line:84%
sum of all possible
contractions.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:52.040 align:middle line:90%


00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:55.510 align:middle line:84%
So each contraction
is just a propagator.

00:38:55.510 --> 00:39:01.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you have x1 bar
x2, each contraction

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:07.490 align:middle line:84%
is just giving you
D0 x1 minus x2.

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:09.785 align:middle line:84%
So now I suppress
the spinor indices.

00:39:09.785 --> 00:39:15.310 align:middle line:90%


00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:18.970 align:middle line:90%
So now you have to be careful.

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:21.690 align:middle line:84%
So one thing you
have to be careful--

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:25.870 align:middle line:84%
you say now all this
becomes anticommuting.

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:31.780 align:middle line:84%
So when you take the derivative,
you have to be careful--

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.880 align:middle line:90%
when you do the contraction--

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.390 align:middle line:90%
about the order of the psi's.

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, if you look
at the 2-point function,

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:57.635 align:middle line:84%
if you have psi x1 psi bar
x2 and psi bar x3 psi x4--

00:39:57.635 --> 00:40:00.290 align:middle line:90%


00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:10.940 align:middle line:84%
if you have this, then there
are two possible contractions.

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:13.280 align:middle line:84%
You can have this
contract with that,

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.850 align:middle line:84%
this contract with that,
or this contract with that,

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:18.740 align:middle line:90%
and this contract with that.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:22.850 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be
careful about the sign.

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:25.520 align:middle line:90%
And if you are careful--

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:31.490 align:middle line:84%
so you find you
will get minus D0.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:42.000 align:middle line:84%
So x1 minus x2 and
the dx4 minus x3--

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.670 align:middle line:84%
so the minus, then, comes from--
you need to exchange these two

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:49.250 align:middle line:84%
so that you have the form
of psi and the psi bar--

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:51.440 align:middle line:90%
have psi and psi bar.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:41:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you can also
have the D0 x1 minus x3

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:04.670 align:middle line:90%
and D0 x4 minus x2.

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:07.210 align:middle line:90%


00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:11.350 align:middle line:84%
So in this one, you can
just change the order.

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:13.240 align:middle line:84%
So here, it should
be time-ordered.

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:17.270 align:middle line:90%


00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:20.245 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason
this plus sign is here

00:41:20.245 --> 00:41:24.490 align:middle line:84%
is because you can shift
this x2 by two positions

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:29.320 align:middle line:84%
to the right of the psi
x4, and then these two

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.170 align:middle line:90%
will now become neighbors.

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And then psi 4 and psi
2 will be neighbors.

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.840 align:middle line:84%
So you just get
the positive sign.

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.710 align:middle line:84%
So you just have to be
careful about the sign.

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:49.610 align:middle line:90%


00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:51.632 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:41:51.632 --> 00:41:53.715 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, everything
is the same as before.

00:41:53.715 --> 00:41:57.760 align:middle line:90%


00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So now, you can also just
do the interacting theory.

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:13.100 align:middle line:90%


00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Say, now, the correlation
function in the interacting

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:24.920 align:middle line:90%
theory divided by omega--

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:28.100 align:middle line:84%
and now, you just do
perturbation theory.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:35.250 align:middle line:84%
We just use that, and then you
can write it as the correlation

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:36.420 align:middle line:90%
functions in free theory.

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.770 align:middle line:90%


00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Again, everything is
the same, just now

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:52.060 align:middle line:84%
you have to be careful now the
integral is over the Grassmann

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:54.130 align:middle line:90%
variables.

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:56.080 align:middle line:90%
So T-- again, here is T--

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:59.270 align:middle line:90%


00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:00.130 align:middle line:90%
time-ordered.

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:04.220 align:middle line:90%


00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, everything
is just the same as before.

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And again, you can
show that a vacuum--

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:20.035 align:middle line:90%
diagrams with vacuum bubbles--

00:43:20.035 --> 00:43:24.670 align:middle line:90%


00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:25.170 align:middle line:90%
cancel.

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:27.780 align:middle line:90%


00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:30.480 align:middle line:84%
It will cancel so you don't have
to include the vacuum bubble.

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And then the
epsilon prescription

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:36.240 align:middle line:84%
is the m goes to
m minus i epsilon.

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.785 align:middle line:90%
OK, very similar to before.

00:43:37.785 --> 00:43:44.050 align:middle line:90%


00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:44.550 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:45.480 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:48.210 align:middle line:90%


00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can just
apply, identically,

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:56.600 align:middle line:84%
the formalism we developed
before for interacting theory

00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.020 align:middle line:84%
of scalar fields to
here, except we just

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:02.960 align:middle line:84%
have to be careful
about some signs,

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.570 align:middle line:84%
because when you exchange the
fermions, you get some signs.

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And other than those
subtleties of signs,

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:11.760 align:middle line:84%
everything else
will be the same.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.810 align:middle line:84%
But those signs sometimes
can be annoying.

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:17.220 align:middle line:90%


00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:21.090 align:middle line:90%
So we can derive the Feynman--

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:23.580 align:middle line:84%
we can draw the Feynman
diagrams as before

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and write down the
Feynman rules, et cetera.

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:29.520 align:middle line:90%
So now, let me just write--

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:34.240 align:middle line:90%


00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.740 align:middle line:84%
yeah, just everything
carries over.

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:37.570 align:middle line:84%
So let me just
emphasize the difference

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:38.560 align:middle line:90%
from the scalar case.

00:44:38.560 --> 00:45:11.480 align:middle line:90%


00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:29.430 align:middle line:84%
So the difference of Feynman
rules from the scalar case--

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:40.070 align:middle line:90%


00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:43.080 align:middle line:90%
so there's various differences.

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.260 align:middle line:90%
So first, let's talk about the--

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.840 align:middle line:84%
remember, we have
different Feynman rules

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:52.790 align:middle line:84%
for Green functions
and also have ones

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:54.660 align:middle line:90%
for scattering amplitudes.

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:57.140 align:middle line:84%
So the scattering
amplitude is the one which

00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:00.270 align:middle line:90%
the external legs truncated.

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And in the Green function, you
don't truncate external legs.

00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:07.600 align:middle line:84%
So now, let me first say
for the Green functions--

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.190 align:middle line:90%
so for the propagator--

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:18.260 align:middle line:90%


00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:22.660 align:middle line:84%
again, the propagator is
just represented by a line.

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:27.970 align:middle line:84%
But here, we have
a complex field.

00:46:27.970 --> 00:46:30.850 align:middle line:84%
So as we did for the
complex scalar field, now

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:35.360 align:middle line:84%
you need to assign an
arrow to indicate the flow

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.690 align:middle line:90%
of the direction of the charge.

00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:43.560 align:middle line:84%
So we always assign the
arrow to flow from the bar

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:48.120 align:middle line:90%
to the unbarred side.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So for that one,
we will do that.

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.720 align:middle line:90%
So this will be x2--

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.100 align:middle line:90%
will be x1.

00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Suppose this is beta,
this will be alpha.

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:09.940 align:middle line:84%
So if I put the
alpha beta here, this

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:12.760 align:middle line:84%
will be alpha x1
and the beta x2,

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.850 align:middle line:90%
and then the arrow goes to the--

00:47:15.850 --> 00:47:17.770 align:middle line:90%
yeah, so this is a charge arrow.

00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:19.420 align:middle line:90%
This is not the momentum arrow.

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:23.620 align:middle line:84%
You can also, in additionally,
assign a momentum.

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:25.600 align:middle line:84%
You can additionally
assign a momentum.

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And the momentum-- yeah, so
this is in a coordinate space.

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, so this is in
the coordinate space.

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And so this just gives you
D0 alpha beta x1 minus x2--

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:41.450 align:middle line:90%
so in the coordinate space.

00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So in momentum space, we
don't label the locations.

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:51.960 align:middle line:84%
So in momentum space, we
just have alpha and the beta.

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And now you also
have a momentum.

00:47:55.440 --> 00:48:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So you can choose the momentum
in any direction you want.

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:04.847 align:middle line:84%
So, often, for convenience,
just as in the scalar case,

00:48:04.847 --> 00:48:06.930 align:middle line:84%
we often choose a momentum
to be in the same arrow

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:07.990 align:middle line:90%
in this direction.

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:10.200 align:middle line:84%
But in the case which you
want to choose a momentum

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:12.150 align:middle line:84%
arrow to be different,
you can just

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:18.870 align:middle line:84%
draw a momentum arrow
which can be different.

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:21.270 align:middle line:84%
So the momentum space
is the propagator.

00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:24.100 align:middle line:84%
It is given by what we have
already written before.

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:32.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's given by minus 1
over i slash minus n plus i

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:35.066 align:middle line:90%
epsilon alpha beta.

00:48:35.066 --> 00:48:41.690 align:middle line:90%


00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:42.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:51.740 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I thought
of it as a particle traveling

00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:52.583 align:middle line:90%
through space.

00:48:52.583 --> 00:48:53.250 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:54.667 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Like we
were contracting

00:48:54.667 --> 00:48:59.280 align:middle line:84%
two different fields, so why
do I still think about it

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.753 align:middle line:84%
as a fermion moving
through space time.

00:49:01.753 --> 00:49:02.420 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:05.170 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:07.630 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you can--

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:11.347 align:middle line:84%
no, that aspect is the same
as in the complex scalar case.

00:49:11.347 --> 00:49:12.680 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Right, but even then--

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.510 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No different from
the complex scalar case.

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:15.335 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:15.335 --> 00:49:17.000 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: But why
do we still think

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000 align:middle line:84%
of it as the same particle
propagating even though it's

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.080 align:middle line:90%
interacting [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:21.500 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.708 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can consider it
as the particle propagating

00:49:23.708 --> 00:49:25.797 align:middle line:84%
in one direction and
then the antiparticle

00:49:25.797 --> 00:49:27.380 align:middle line:84%
propagating in the
opposite direction.

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:28.713 align:middle line:90%
You can interpret it either way.

00:49:28.713 --> 00:49:31.270 align:middle line:90%


00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the importance is the
direction of the charge flow.

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:41.380 align:middle line:90%


00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:41.880 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:47.000 align:middle line:90%


00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so the momentum
we emphasize.

00:49:49.430 --> 00:50:00.840 align:middle line:84%
So the charge arrow
is not arbitrary,

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:10.950 align:middle line:84%
but the momentum
arrow is arbitrary.

00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:13.470 align:middle line:84%
So momentum arrow-- you can
choose whatever you want.

00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:17.640 align:middle line:90%


00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:26.270 align:middle line:84%
So also, the rule we
do for the external--

00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:31.910 align:middle line:90%


00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:37.690 align:middle line:84%
so the b-- so if we talk
about the external point,

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:43.420 align:middle line:84%
we look for the propagator
for the correlation functions.

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Say you have those external
points, and some of them

00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:51.340 align:middle line:84%
will be psi, some of
them will be psi bar.

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:53.745 align:middle line:84%
Again, we assign
the rule as this.

00:50:53.745 --> 00:50:58.080 align:middle line:90%


00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:06.430 align:middle line:84%
For each external
point, if it's a psi--

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:12.200 align:middle line:84%
if the endpoint is given
by the psi bar alpha x--

00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:16.640 align:middle line:84%
from the rule, the arrow
always leaves the direction

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.960 align:middle line:90%
from the psi bar.

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Then we should
draw it as alpha x.

00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:25.500 align:middle line:90%
So this is the external point.

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And then, similarly, if you
have a psi alpha x, this is--

00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:36.580 align:middle line:90%
and then the arrow will come in.

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:45.000 align:middle line:90%


00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.290 align:middle line:84%
So in momentum space, if we
choose the momentum to be

00:51:49.290 --> 00:51:51.140 align:middle line:90%
the same direction--

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:56.420 align:middle line:84%
so we just have k, and we
take k to be the same arrow.

00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And here, again,
it's the same thing.

00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:04.380 align:middle line:90%


00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:06.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is the coordinate space,
this is the momentum space.

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.450 align:middle line:84%
This is for psi
bar, this for psi.

00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:12.717 align:middle line:90%


00:52:12.717 --> 00:52:14.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, just follow the same rule.

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:15.074 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:52:15.074 --> 00:52:22.685 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:22.685 --> 00:52:24.310 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
we'll talk about that.

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:25.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Here, I'm talking about
the correlation functions.

00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:32.560 align:middle line:84%
In correlation functions, you
don't talk about the particles.

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.945 align:middle line:84%
You just look at, what
are the external points?

00:52:34.945 --> 00:52:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk about
scattering amplitudes,

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:37.930 align:middle line:90%
then we talk about--

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:41.570 align:middle line:84%
I haven't talked about
scattering amplitude yet.

00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:42.890 align:middle line:90%
Do you have any questions?

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:43.760 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:47.720 align:middle line:90%


00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:49.870 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:52.260 align:middle line:90%
So now the most important--

00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:56.030 align:middle line:90%


00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:59.630 align:middle line:84%
now you have spinors, and
now you have components.

00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Now the propagator is a matrix
and each spinor is a vector,

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:09.970 align:middle line:84%
so you have to be careful
about the indices.

00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:12.730 align:middle line:84%
So the last thing you
have to be careful

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:13.975 align:middle line:90%
is that now you have to--

00:53:13.975 --> 00:53:17.220 align:middle line:90%


00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:30.900 align:middle line:84%
so the spinor indices
are contracted

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:46.800 align:middle line:84%
following the arrows, and I
will explain what this means.

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:49.260 align:middle line:84%
So here, it's a
little bit heuristic--

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:51.600 align:middle line:84%
a statement is a bit
heuristic-- but I

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:54.180 align:middle line:84%
will explain in detail what
this means when we talk

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:56.400 align:middle line:90%
about scattering amplitudes.

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.760 align:middle line:90%
Because the scattering ampli--

00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:00.300 align:middle line:84%
so this aspect will be similar
to the scattering amplitudes

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:02.820 align:middle line:84%
that we just explained
in one place.

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:06.130 align:middle line:90%


00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:10.450 align:middle line:90%
So the scattering amplitude--

00:54:10.450 --> 00:54:13.330 align:middle line:84%
so the rule follows,
again, from this LSZ,

00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:15.630 align:middle line:90%
which I will not derive--

00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:21.090 align:middle line:84%
this Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann
reduction rule.

00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:24.850 align:middle line:90%
And so you consider--

00:54:24.850 --> 00:54:27.480 align:middle line:90%
say you have some initial--

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:31.320 align:middle line:84%
you have some final particles,
some initial particles

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:33.690 align:middle line:84%
scattered into some
final particles.

00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And now we specify the particles
not only by their momentum,

00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:44.490 align:middle line:90%
but also by their polarization.

00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:50.430 align:middle line:84%
So suppose that the p1
is the momentum of one

00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:52.620 align:middle line:84%
of the first incoming
particles, r1

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:59.350 align:middle line:84%
would be its polarization
and et cetera.

00:54:59.350 --> 00:55:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And for antiparticle,
we put a bar.

00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:07.260 align:middle line:84%
So for the second particle,
it's the antiparticle.

00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:09.990 align:middle line:90%
Then we put r2 bar.

00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:14.580 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that means this
is an antiparticle.

00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, for
the final state,

00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:24.000 align:middle line:84%
we specify it by momentum
and the polarization.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And if we do a bar, again,
we mean the antiparticle.

00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:33.470 align:middle line:84%
The scattering
amplitude is where

00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:36.920 align:middle line:84%
we want to calculate things like
this with some initial momentum

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:37.865 align:middle line:90%
and the--

00:55:37.865 --> 00:55:41.700 align:middle line:90%


00:55:41.700 --> 00:56:01.000 align:middle line:84%
so to specify by the initial
and the final momenta

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.350 align:middle line:90%
and the polarizations.

00:56:02.350 --> 00:56:11.680 align:middle line:90%


00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And then the bar is
for antiparticle.

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:25.380 align:middle line:90%


00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:30.380 align:middle line:84%
So between the scattering
amplitude and the Green

00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:33.650 align:middle line:84%
function, the only
difference is how

00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:38.780 align:middle line:90%
you choose the external lines.

00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:42.880 align:middle line:84%
All the propagators--
these are the same.

00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:45.930 align:middle line:84%
So now, remember
in the scalar case,

00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:52.380 align:middle line:84%
we just remove all
the external lines.

00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:58.640 align:middle line:84%
But here, we have to be a little
bit careful because now they

00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:00.570 align:middle line:90%
have the polarization.

00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And now we should have things
to specify the polarization

00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:06.230 align:middle line:90%
of each particle.

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So now it's
reasonable to expect,

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:13.140 align:middle line:84%
and the polarization
of each particle

00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:16.305 align:middle line:84%
is specified by those u and v
functions we derived earlier.

00:57:16.305 --> 00:57:30.880 align:middle line:90%


00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:32.800 align:middle line:84%
So we truncate all
the propagators

00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:35.860 align:middle line:84%
for the external
lines, but we have

00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:43.660 align:middle line:90%
to assign polarization vectors.

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:48.040 align:middle line:90%


00:57:48.040 --> 00:58:12.390 align:middle line:84%
So need to-- assign polarization
vectors for each initial

00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:15.375 align:middle line:90%
and final particle--

00:58:15.375 --> 00:58:17.970 align:middle line:90%


00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:19.485 align:middle line:90%
particle or antiparticle.

00:58:19.485 --> 00:58:22.780 align:middle line:90%


00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:30.190 align:middle line:84%
So let me just state
the rule, and then I

00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:33.630 align:middle line:90%
will motivate the rule.

00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:43.950 align:middle line:84%
So for the initial state, if
you consider the initial state--

00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:45.630 align:middle line:90%
then if you have a particle--

00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:51.420 align:middle line:90%


00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:56.540 align:middle line:84%
so suppose this particle
is polarization-- r1.

00:58:56.540 --> 00:59:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And then we draw a line like
this with the arrow like that,

00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and then assign the polarization
vector, assign u r1.

00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:10.400 align:middle line:84%
So suppose that these
have momentum p1 and p1.

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:15.760 align:middle line:90%


00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And for antiparticle,
say, for example, r2 bar--

00:59:28.790 --> 00:59:32.500 align:middle line:84%
say we just reverse the
direction of the arrow.

00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And then the
polarization vector--

00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:39.040 align:middle line:90%
I use v bar r2 and p2.

00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:43.060 align:middle line:84%
I always draw the momentum to
be the same as the charge arrow.

00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:46.000 align:middle line:84%
So this is for
the initial state,

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.130 align:middle line:84%
and the final state
is the following.

00:59:48.130 --> 00:59:52.910 align:middle line:90%


00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:56.290 align:middle line:84%
So we just first write down the
rule, then I will motivate it.

00:59:56.290 --> 01:00:01.690 align:middle line:84%
So the final state--
if it's a particle,

01:00:01.690 --> 01:00:03.220 align:middle line:90%
then the particle will come out.

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:06.660 align:middle line:90%


01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And this is s1 and,
say, suppose this is k1.

01:00:12.790 --> 01:00:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And then it's given
by u bar s1 k1.

01:00:17.170 --> 01:00:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So if it's an
antiparticle, and then it's

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:26.430 align:middle line:90%
an arrow which is going out--

01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:42.295 align:middle line:84%
suppose this is s2 bar, then
this is given by v2 vs2 k2.

01:00:42.295 --> 01:00:45.730 align:middle line:90%


01:00:45.730 --> 01:00:49.180 align:middle line:84%
So when you do the
scattering amplitude,

01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:51.550 align:middle line:84%
you forget about the
external propagator,

01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:56.680 align:middle line:84%
but you attach to each external
line a polarization vector.

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:58.692 align:middle line:84%
OK, polarization vector--
just specify u and v

01:00:58.692 --> 01:00:59.650 align:middle line:90%
according to this rule.

01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:03.150 align:middle line:90%


01:01:03.150 --> 01:01:05.260 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's see
why this is the rule.

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:09.570 align:middle line:90%


01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:12.260 align:middle line:84%
So remember-- so let's
use this as an example.

01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:15.420 align:middle line:90%


01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:20.525 align:middle line:84%
So this is the initial state,
then that means this is a ket.

01:01:20.525 --> 01:01:23.350 align:middle line:90%


01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:26.560 align:middle line:84%
So if you remember that
psi has the structure--

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:33.160 align:middle line:90%
the au plus b dagger v--

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:37.330 align:middle line:84%
then psi bar has the
structure a dagger u bar

01:01:37.330 --> 01:01:42.110 align:middle line:90%
plus b, say, v bar.

01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:44.840 align:middle line:90%
So remember this structure.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:52.300 align:middle line:84%
So for the initial state, let's
try to motivate this rule.

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:55.870 align:middle line:84%
So initial state,
you have a p1 r1.

01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:58.310 align:middle line:84%
So suppose you have
a particle like this.

01:01:58.310 --> 01:02:00.160 align:middle line:90%
So this is obtained by--

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:07.640 align:middle line:84%
so don't worry about
the proportional factor.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:18.460 align:middle line:84%
So this is given by p1,
then r1 dagger acting on 0.

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:20.380 align:middle line:90%
And then this you can obtain--

01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:23.830 align:middle line:84%
you see the psi is
proportional-- so

01:02:23.830 --> 01:02:26.260 align:middle line:84%
in order to have a dagger,
you have to have psi bar.

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:29.510 align:middle line:90%


01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:33.580 align:middle line:84%
So this is given by-- it
can be obtained from psi bar

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:37.660 align:middle line:84%
by multiplying psi bar,
say, by something like this.

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:44.150 align:middle line:84%
So exponential minus i--
yeah, so you can verify this,

01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:46.430 align:middle line:84%
but, heuristically,
you will understand.

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:56.410 align:middle line:90%
Psi bar x gamma zero u r1 p1--

01:02:56.410 --> 01:02:58.360 align:middle line:90%
acting on 0.

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:02.920 align:middle line:84%
So because psi bar has
lots of other things,

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.290 align:middle line:84%
you need to multiply this
by this polarization vector

01:03:05.290 --> 01:03:09.340 align:middle line:84%
so that it will extract
the a p1 r1 piece.

01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
polarization vector

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:14.650 align:middle line:90%
you need to include here.

01:03:14.650 --> 01:03:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And the reason this is the
arrow which is going out

01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:19.040 align:middle line:90%
is because this is psi bar.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.210 align:middle line:84%
So remember, the things always
come out from the psi bar--

01:03:22.210 --> 01:03:25.810 align:middle line:90%


01:03:25.810 --> 01:03:28.600 align:middle line:84%
from this rule, to come
out of this from psi bar.

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So similarly, you can
understand the other rules.

01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:37.160 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:37.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:03:37.850 --> 01:03:43.752 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:43.752 --> 01:03:45.460 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
because you have a spin.

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:49.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, a spin has polarization.

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:52.210 align:middle line:84%
This is to characterize the
polarization of the spin.

01:03:52.210 --> 01:03:52.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:54.793 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I'm just trying
to think back-- is there

01:03:54.793 --> 01:03:58.085 align:middle line:84%
a symmetry that
causes us to need

01:03:58.085 --> 01:03:59.293 align:middle line:90%
to specify this polarization?

01:03:59.293 --> 01:04:03.250 align:middle line:90%


01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:03.987 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

01:04:03.987 --> 01:04:06.070 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So this is always
the case for fermions.

01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:07.960 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:08.590 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:10.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, this is always-- yeah.

01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:14.773 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: When I'm thinking back
to the scalar piece [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:14.773 --> 01:04:16.815 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, because
there's no polarization.

01:04:16.815 --> 01:04:20.190 align:middle line:90%


01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, for scalar, all
this just becomes one

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:24.118 align:middle line:90%
because there's no polarization.

01:04:24.118 --> 01:04:27.050 align:middle line:90%


01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:30.290 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:04:30.290 --> 01:04:36.040 align:middle line:84%
OK, so these are just
rules you can understand.

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And then this
antiparticle initial state

01:04:38.410 --> 01:04:42.040 align:middle line:84%
will be created by
psi, and then you

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:46.600 align:middle line:84%
need to multiply by psi--
by v bar on this term

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.390 align:middle line:90%
to extract this b dagger term.

01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Because the v v bar,
they're contracted.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
extract this v plus.

01:04:56.830 --> 01:05:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that's
where this will come.

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:01.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:09.150 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:13.530 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, in the real
experiment, it's often--

01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:17.580 align:middle line:84%
it's not easy to
observe the polarized.

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:21.480 align:middle line:90%
You have to have very special--

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:23.670 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:25.560 align:middle line:84%
In general, you
observe unpolarized.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:28.800 align:middle line:90%


01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:05:32.030 --> 01:05:33.410 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:43.030 align:middle line:84%
So again, now I can specify more
precisely this spinor indices

01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:49.890 align:middle line:84%
rule for the scattering
amplitude case.

01:05:49.890 --> 01:05:55.640 align:middle line:84%
So now you see
the initial state,

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:59.140 align:middle line:84%
so now you have this
u bar and you have u.

01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:01.810 align:middle line:84%
So the rule for the
spinor indices contraction

01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:03.830 align:middle line:90%
are the following.

01:06:03.830 --> 01:06:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So the spinor indices
are contracted

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:22.120 align:middle line:84%
by starting at the
one end, so at one

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.470 align:middle line:90%
end of a fermionic line--

01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:38.040 align:middle line:90%


01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:50.270 align:middle line:84%
this external factor,
either u bar or v bar.

01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:53.120 align:middle line:90%


01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:54.770 align:middle line:90%
So you start from--

01:06:54.770 --> 01:07:13.220 align:middle line:84%
and then you go
back, and then you

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:29.610 align:middle line:84%
go along the complete line
following the arrow backwards.

01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:42.920 align:middle line:90%


01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So right now, it's a
little bit abstract.

01:07:47.030 --> 01:07:50.555 align:middle line:84%
Now let me just explain
this rule using an example.

01:07:50.555 --> 01:07:51.665 align:middle line:90%
It would be very clear.

01:07:51.665 --> 01:07:55.300 align:middle line:90%


01:07:55.300 --> 01:08:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, we'll explain this
rule using an example.

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:05.450 align:middle line:84%
So now let's consider
the following example.

01:08:05.450 --> 01:08:10.090 align:middle line:84%
So a very important example
in the development of particle

01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:16.270 align:middle line:84%
physics is this called Yukawa
theory, which Yukawa proposed,

01:08:16.270 --> 01:08:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I think, around the
1930s, something--

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:22.140 align:middle line:84%
and which he got a
Nobel Prize for it.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:27.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's consider you
have a scalar field.

01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:30.479 align:middle line:84%
So let's just say you
have the Klein-Gordon--

01:08:30.479 --> 01:08:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Lagrangian density
for scalar fields,

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.094 align:middle line:84%
and then you have a
Dirac Lagrangian for psi.

01:08:37.094 --> 01:08:40.260 align:middle line:90%


01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And then, supposed they intact,
a term like this-- minus g phi

01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:48.580 align:middle line:90%
psi bar psi.

01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:51.939 align:middle line:90%


01:08:51.939 --> 01:08:53.950 align:middle line:84%
So this clearly is
Lorentz invariance.

01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:58.630 align:middle line:90%


01:08:58.630 --> 01:09:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And so, essentially, now you
can just draw the propagator.

01:09:09.490 --> 01:09:17.100 align:middle line:84%
So the propagators-- say, let's
denote this to be the phi,

01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:20.700 align:middle line:84%
and then these have
the standard minus i,

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:24.189 align:middle line:84%
say, k squared plus m
squared minus i epsilon.

01:09:24.189 --> 01:09:26.460 align:middle line:90%
So if this has momentum k--

01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:29.100 align:middle line:90%


01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:31.840 align:middle line:90%
so we also have fermionic lines.

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.029 align:middle line:84%
I will draw it
using the real line

01:09:36.029 --> 01:09:40.970 align:middle line:84%
so this can have
the form ik slash

01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:44.890 align:middle line:90%
plus m minus m plus i epsilon.

01:09:44.890 --> 01:09:47.979 align:middle line:90%


01:09:47.979 --> 01:09:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
interaction vertices--

01:09:50.290 --> 01:09:57.040 align:middle line:90%


01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.530 align:middle line:90%
so minus ig.

01:09:58.530 --> 01:10:02.810 align:middle line:90%


01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:05.840 align:middle line:84%
So because here, I have
a psi and a psi bar--

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.480 align:middle line:84%
one of the lines coming out,
one of the lines coming in.

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:13.020 align:middle line:90%


01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:15.420 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's just consider
a scattering process.

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:22.710 align:middle line:90%


01:10:22.710 --> 01:10:25.897 align:middle line:84%
When Yukawa considered this,
and the psi corresponding

01:10:25.897 --> 01:10:27.810 align:middle line:90%
to say, the proton--

01:10:27.810 --> 01:10:31.020 align:middle line:84%
and then the phi
corresponding to pion.

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And he used this theory to
explain the nuclear force

01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:35.265 align:middle line:90%
between the proton.

01:10:35.265 --> 01:10:40.320 align:middle line:90%


01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.390 align:middle line:84%
So now let's just
consider the proc-- yeah,

01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:47.550 align:middle line:84%
but you can also consider,
say, psi is an electron or phi

01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:49.710 align:middle line:90%
is a Higgs field, et cetera.

01:10:49.710 --> 01:10:54.390 align:middle line:84%
So now let's just consider
the process of this p.

01:10:54.390 --> 01:11:02.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's denote the psi
particle by p, go to p.

01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:06.560 align:middle line:90%
So you have two initial states.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Particles in final state
are also particles.

01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:11.780 align:middle line:90%


01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And now you have the one
obvious diagram you can draw,

01:11:18.490 --> 01:11:22.540 align:middle line:84%
because now the internal--
so the incoming line

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:28.570 align:middle line:84%
should be-- because the
particles should go in,

01:11:28.570 --> 01:11:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and then the final state,
the particle should come out.

01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:35.700 align:middle line:84%
So one possible
diagram is like this.

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:40.920 align:middle line:90%


01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:42.510 align:middle line:90%
So suppose this is the p1.

01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:50.070 align:middle line:90%


01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Polarization s1-- suppose this
is p2 s2, and then this is k1.

01:11:57.330 --> 01:12:02.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's call it p1 prime s1
prime and p2 prime s2 prime.

01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:07.180 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the
diagrams which can do this,

01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:10.690 align:middle line:84%
but we can also have this
internal line connect

01:12:10.690 --> 01:12:13.220 align:middle line:84%
with that line and this
line connect that line.

01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:15.265 align:middle line:84%
So you can also have
a structure like this.

01:12:15.265 --> 01:12:23.530 align:middle line:90%


01:12:23.530 --> 01:12:35.640 align:middle line:84%
So we have p1 s1 and p2 s2, then
p1 prime s1 prime p2 prime s2

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:38.430 align:middle line:90%
prime.

01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:40.770 align:middle line:84%
OK, so these are the
two possible diagrams,

01:12:40.770 --> 01:12:41.730 align:middle line:90%
at lowest order.

01:12:41.730 --> 01:12:44.240 align:middle line:90%


01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:46.430 align:middle line:84%
So now let's write down the
expression corresponding

01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:47.435 align:middle line:90%
to these two diagrams.

01:12:47.435 --> 01:13:00.240 align:middle line:90%


01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.920 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
we can write down--

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:19.450 align:middle line:90%


01:13:19.450 --> 01:13:22.510 align:middle line:84%
so each thing should give
you a number in the end.

01:13:22.510 --> 01:13:25.830 align:middle line:90%


01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:36.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's why-- but remember,
all these are vectors.

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:39.090 align:middle line:90%
All these are spinors.

01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:41.370 align:middle line:84%
So in the end, all
the spinor indices

01:13:41.370 --> 01:13:43.050 align:middle line:84%
should be contracted
with each other.

01:13:43.050 --> 01:13:48.070 align:middle line:90%


01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:51.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's why when
we do this rule,

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:54.180 align:middle line:84%
you always start with
u bar and the v bar,

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:58.770 align:middle line:84%
because these are
the row vectors.

01:13:58.770 --> 01:14:02.370 align:middle line:84%
In the end, you want to
contract with column vectors.

01:14:02.370 --> 01:14:06.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you always start
with u bar and the v bar.

01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:11.170 align:middle line:84%
So u bar and the v bar-- if
you look at this rule here--

01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:13.530 align:middle line:84%
so the u bar either
corresponding

01:14:13.530 --> 01:14:17.420 align:middle line:84%
to the final particles,
v bar corresponding

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:19.730 align:middle line:90%
to initial antiparticles.

01:14:19.730 --> 01:14:25.200 align:middle line:84%
In both cases, the arrow is
always going toward the point.

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:27.660 align:middle line:84%
If you start from here,
you have to go backwards.

01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:31.620 align:middle line:90%


01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So now let's look
at this example.

01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.490 align:middle line:84%
So we have two
fermionic lines here.

01:14:35.490 --> 01:14:39.390 align:middle line:90%


01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:42.500 align:middle line:84%
So one is this one
and one is this one.

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:44.030 align:middle line:90%
OK, we have two fermionic lines.

01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:47.730 align:middle line:84%
So for this expanded line,
we should start with the bar.

01:14:47.730 --> 01:14:49.850 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
outgoing particle,

01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:56.030 align:middle line:84%
so that's corresponding
to u bar here, s1 prime,

01:14:56.030 --> 01:15:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and here corresponding
to u bar s2 prime.

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And then this is
corresponding to-- this

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:07.540 align:middle line:84%
is the initial particle, then
this is corresponding to u s1,

01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and this is
corresponding to u s2.

01:15:11.150 --> 01:15:14.100 align:middle line:90%
And so we just go backwards.

01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:17.460 align:middle line:84%
So now we can just write
it down very easily.

01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:21.880 align:middle line:84%
So we have minus ig squared
corresponding to two vertices,

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:26.880 align:middle line:84%
and for the first
fermionic line, we have--

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:34.220 align:middle line:84%
for the first diagram, we have
u s1 prime bar p1 prime and then

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:36.140 align:middle line:90%
u s1 p1.

01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And so these
combine into a sca--

01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:39.130 align:middle line:90%
number.

01:15:39.130 --> 01:15:46.028 align:middle line:90%


01:15:46.028 --> 01:15:47.320 align:middle line:90%
And now we have the propagator.

01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:54.160 align:middle line:84%
A propagator is just a number
minus i p1 prime minus p2

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:58.380 align:middle line:84%
squared plus m squared
minus i epsilon.

01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:00.380 align:middle line:84%
So in principle, they can
have a different mass.

01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:02.290 align:middle line:90%
OK, sorry.

01:16:02.290 --> 01:16:05.880 align:middle line:90%
For example, here is m tilde.

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And then we multiply the
other fermionic line.

01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:12.540 align:middle line:90%


01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:23.590 align:middle line:84%
So this will be u s2 prime
bar p2 prime and then u s2 p2.

01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:26.400 align:middle line:90%


01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And now, for this diagram,
we just follow the same rule.

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:33.480 align:middle line:84%
But now, this one is
contracted with that,

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:35.760 align:middle line:84%
and this one is
contracted with that--

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:40.295 align:middle line:84%
so except we still
have minus ig squared.

01:16:40.295 --> 01:16:43.020 align:middle line:90%


01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:52.750 align:middle line:84%
So now this u s1 prime p1 prime
is contracted with u s2 p2.

01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:54.390 align:middle line:90%
OK, they are connected.

01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Now they become
a connected line.

01:16:57.590 --> 01:17:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And, again, you
have these indices,

01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:03.440 align:middle line:84%
and now you work
out the momentum

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:07.430 align:middle line:84%
to become p2 prime
minus p1 squared

01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:10.680 align:middle line:90%
plus m squared minus i epsilon.

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And then you have an
s2 prime p2 prime,

01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:17.270 align:middle line:90%
and now you have u s1 p1.

01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:21.490 align:middle line:90%


01:17:21.490 --> 01:17:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Except one final thing,
there's a relative minus sign

01:17:26.290 --> 01:17:29.050 align:middle line:90%
between them.

01:17:29.050 --> 01:17:32.320 align:middle line:84%
The reason there's a relative
minus sign between them

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:37.210 align:middle line:84%
is because between these two
diagrams, it's equivalent.

01:17:37.210 --> 01:17:40.830 align:middle line:84%
I exchanged the order of
the two external legs.

01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So remember, if you
want to exchange

01:17:42.450 --> 01:17:45.870 align:middle line:84%
the order of the fermions,
you have to have a minus sign.

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to have a
minus sign between the two.

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:49.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:52.920 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:53.625 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Oh.

01:17:53.625 --> 01:17:54.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, of course.

01:17:54.330 --> 01:17:57.750 align:middle line:84%
But we never write
them down explicitly.

01:17:57.750 --> 01:18:00.550 align:middle line:84%
So always assume
momentum conservation.

01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:03.990 align:middle line:84%
So for this diagram,
the momentum--

01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:09.390 align:middle line:84%
if I draw momentum here, it
will be p prime prime minus p1.

01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So this momentum will
be p2 prime minus p1.

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:17.210 align:middle line:90%


01:18:17.210 --> 01:18:17.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:24.860 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So it's
probably [INAUDIBLE]

01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:26.390 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Minus
p1-- that's right.

01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:27.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's right.

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:33.100 align:middle line:90%


01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:34.470 align:middle line:90%
Good?

01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:39.820 align:middle line:84%
So just like that, you
just follow this rule.

01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:43.770 align:middle line:90%
You just start with the line.

01:18:43.770 --> 01:18:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Always start with
u bar and v bar,

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:48.510 align:middle line:84%
and you just follow
the arrow backwards.

01:18:48.510 --> 01:18:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And keep track all the gamma
matrices and the spinor

01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:56.080 align:middle line:90%
indices, et cetera.

01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And then, eventually, you
will just get a number.

01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:06.600 align:middle line:84%
You will multiply with a column
vector, and then you are done.

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:10.050 align:middle line:90%
So here, we are considering--

01:19:10.050 --> 01:19:12.300 align:middle line:90%
here, the vertex is very simple.

01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:15.100 align:middle line:90%
It's just a number.

01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And later, we will consider
a more complicated vertex.

01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:20.217 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the vertex
can contain matrices.

01:19:20.217 --> 01:19:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And so that will be a
little bit more complicated.

01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:24.670 align:middle line:90%
Also, this is a simple--

01:19:24.670 --> 01:19:26.050 align:middle line:90%
here is a simple example.

01:19:26.050 --> 01:19:28.090 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a
fermionic propagator.

01:19:28.090 --> 01:19:29.980 align:middle line:84%
We only have a bosonic
propagator here.

01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:32.960 align:middle line:90%


01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:33.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:36.690 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: How do you
know which one's which?

01:19:36.690 --> 01:19:39.030 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
it doesn't matter

01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:41.010 align:middle line:84%
because the overall
signs don't matter.

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:43.050 align:middle line:84%
Because in the end,
we will square it.

01:19:43.050 --> 01:19:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so when you calculate
the cross section,

01:19:45.450 --> 01:19:48.335 align:middle line:84%
you have to take
the-- yeah, in order

01:19:48.335 --> 01:19:49.710 align:middle line:84%
to calculate the
probability, you

01:19:49.710 --> 01:19:53.090 align:middle line:84%
have to take the
amplitude square.

01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So overall, signs we don't
normally bother to track.

01:19:56.990 --> 01:20:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you only need to
worry about relative signs.

01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:02.470 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:05.850 align:middle line:90%


01:20:05.850 --> 01:20:06.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:20:06.690 --> 01:20:11.760 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Where did the use of
Grassmann variables [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:12.990 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the sign--

01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:14.880 align:middle line:84%
so the relative
sign between them.

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:17.830 align:middle line:90%


01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:19.238 align:middle line:90%
That's the only place.

01:20:19.238 --> 01:20:20.905 align:middle line:84%
For this example,
that's the only place.

01:20:20.905 --> 01:20:23.470 align:middle line:90%


01:20:23.470 --> 01:20:25.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so that's the minus sign.

01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
the spinor later is

01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:31.510 align:middle line:84%
reflected that you
always have to keep

01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:34.706 align:middle line:90%
track of the spinor indices.

01:20:34.706 --> 01:20:40.240 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.136 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:20:41.136 --> 01:20:44.330 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:44.330 --> 01:20:47.990 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, indeed.

01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:52.183 align:middle line:84%
And then you just miss this
minus sign, essentially.

01:20:52.183 --> 01:20:54.600 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Could you have gotten
the minus sign if you just

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.368 align:middle line:90%
used the operators, right?

01:20:56.368 --> 01:20:57.910 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
but you have to know

01:20:57.910 --> 01:21:00.550 align:middle line:84%
that you have to exchange
them to get the minus sign.

01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:01.990 align:middle line:90%
You have to have that.

01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:05.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, if you don't have that--

01:21:05.170 --> 01:21:07.570 align:middle line:84%
I think when Yukawa
proposed it, he actually

01:21:07.570 --> 01:21:09.790 align:middle line:90%
didn't know all this detail.

01:21:09.790 --> 01:21:11.800 align:middle line:90%
He just estimated.

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.080 align:middle line:90%
And then he predicted the--

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:16.120 align:middle line:84%
yeah, he wanted to
explain the nuclear force

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:20.920 align:middle line:84%
between the proton, and then he
said, oh, maybe the two protons

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:23.620 align:middle line:84%
will exchange all between
proton or neutron.

01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe they exchange
a scalar particle.

01:21:25.810 --> 01:21:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And he just postulated the
exchange of a scalar particle.

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And then from the strength
of the nuclear interaction,

01:21:32.410 --> 01:21:36.510 align:middle line:84%
he estimated the mass
of the particle--

01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:38.100 align:middle line:90%
the scalar particle--

01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:39.985 align:middle line:90%
and then they found it.

01:21:39.985 --> 01:21:40.485 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:21:40.485 --> 01:21:42.720 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Yeah, they found
such a scalar particle

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:44.343 align:middle line:90%
which was the pion.

01:21:44.343 --> 01:21:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they first
discovered the pion.

01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:48.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:49.140 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:51.380 align:middle line:90%
Let's stop here today.

01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:55.000 align:middle line:90%
