00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.630 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: So I hope you all
have had a great spring break.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.190 align:middle line:84%
So before the break, we
talked about Dirac equation.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.490 align:middle line:90%
So we introduced the equation.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.150 align:middle line:84%
We showed that it is
Lorentz covariant.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And then we started talking
about the classical solutions

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.260 align:middle line:84%
of the Dirac equation,
because the finding

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.520 align:middle line:84%
the complete set of
solutions for Dirac equation

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.190 align:middle line:84%
is the necessary step
for quantizing it.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:01:04.239 align:middle line:84%
So let us consider the classical
solutions of Dirac equations.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.070 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And recall the Dirac equation
is given by the following.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.220 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.270 align:middle line:90%
So this gamma matrices--

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.130 align:middle line:84%
so these gamma matrices
are 4x4 matrices,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.820 align:middle line:84%
and psi is a four
complex vector.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And we already just
from setting up

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.110 align:middle line:84%
the Dirac equation and the
properties of the gamma

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.960 align:middle line:84%
matrices that this
should have solutions

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.500 align:middle line:84%
proportional to plane
wave with k square equal

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.170 align:middle line:90%
to minus m square.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:58.600 align:middle line:84%
So our goal is to
find the pre-factors.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.180 align:middle line:84%
So here, we separate into
two kinds of solutions.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.060 align:middle line:90%
So this just reminds you--

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.850 align:middle line:84%
we discussed that at the
end of last lecture--

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.560 align:middle line:84%
we call uk corresponding
to the positive.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:21.930 align:middle line:84%
So we always take k to have
positive time component.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
positive energy solution.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Then we have also so-called
negative energy solution.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.440 align:middle line:90%
So these are just names.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Does not really means that
they have positive energy

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.610 align:middle line:90%
or negative energy.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.800 align:middle line:84%
It just means that
the sign here.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.630 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you plug this
into the Dirac equation,

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.740 align:middle line:84%
and then you get the
algebraic equation for u.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.020 align:middle line:84%
You get the algebraic
equation for u,

00:02:52.020 --> 00:03:03.332 align:middle line:84%
and then you find i k slash
m u equal to 0, and the i k

00:03:03.332 --> 00:03:08.160 align:middle line:90%
slash plus m v equal to 0.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.150 align:middle line:84%
So u and v satisfy
those equations.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I suppose you're already
familiar with the rotation--

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.150 align:middle line:90%
so this k slash.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.890 align:middle line:90%


00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.600 align:middle line:84%
So those equations,
in principle,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.010 align:middle line:90%
you can just solve them.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.230 align:middle line:84%
So these are just
linear equations.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, in principle,
you can just solve them.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.660 align:middle line:84%
But still there are tricks
how we solve them so

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.510 align:middle line:90%
that it's mostly transparent.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.225 align:middle line:84%
So there are two methods
of finding the u and k.

00:03:50.225 --> 00:03:52.990 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So one method is we first
go to the rest frame--

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.850 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:08.990 align:middle line:84%
say we take k mu, say, to
have 0 spatial momentum.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And then the k mu will
be just equal to m 0.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.709 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, those equations
become particularly simple.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.769 align:middle line:84%
And also before we
solve them, actually we

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.660 align:middle line:84%
should also specify the gamma
matrices we need to use.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:34.640 align:middle line:84%
So the gamma matrices we will
use is given by the following.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.395 align:middle line:84%
Again, each are
the 2 by 2 block.

00:04:36.395 --> 00:04:51.220 align:middle line:90%


00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.980 align:middle line:84%
So this is the gamma
matrices we are going to use.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And as we discussed
before, there

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.390 align:middle line:84%
are many, many different
choices of gamma matrices.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are
convenient for certain purpose.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And as we will see,
this one actually

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.120 align:middle line:84%
makes the non-relativistic
limit more manifest.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's conveniently reduced
to non-relativistic limit.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And so in the rest frame,
those equations simplify--

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.620 align:middle line:84%
essentially, u just becomes
the eigenvalue equations

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.450 align:middle line:90%
for gamma 0.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:37.240 align:middle line:84%
So you find-- say,
this equation for u--

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.400 align:middle line:90%


00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.510 align:middle line:84%
so let's denote to the
rest frame by 0, and then--

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:53.290 align:middle line:84%
so the equation for u just
becomes this in the rest frame,

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:59.490 align:middle line:90%
and the v given by this.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:05.080 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, this is just
corresponding-- essentially,

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.610 align:middle line:90%
you see the u and v--

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.710 align:middle line:84%
u0 and v0 just corresponding
to eigenvalues of gamma 0,

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.650 align:middle line:84%
because this is gamma 0
times u gives you a constant.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.525 align:middle line:84%
It can be-- move that constant
to the right-hand side-- it

00:06:17.525 --> 00:06:19.150 align:middle line:84%
just looks like an
eigenvalue equation.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.980 align:middle line:90%


00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.350 align:middle line:90%
And so you can just easily--

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.830 align:middle line:84%
you can plug this in and easily
solve them, which we already

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.920 align:middle line:90%
discussed last time.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.050 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
you find that there

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.800 align:middle line:90%
are two independent equations.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.610 align:middle line:90%
So this is a 4x4 matrix.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:90%
So gamma 0 is a 4x4 matrix.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And actually have two
eigenvalues, say--

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:53.150 align:middle line:84%
so each u and v have two
independent solutions.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.280 align:middle line:90%
So you find that the--

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:03.820 align:middle line:84%
say, for example, one solution
is just given by 1, 0, 0, 0.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:04.320 align:middle line:90%
u2.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.000 align:middle line:90%


00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.600 align:middle line:84%
So this-- we all just discussed
at the end of last lecture

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:90%
here--

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.425 align:middle line:90%
I'm just trying to remind you.

00:07:15.425 --> 00:07:25.480 align:middle line:90%


00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.910 align:middle line:84%
So in this rest
frame, the solutions

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.010 align:middle line:90%
are particularly simple.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And so essentially, you have
two independent solutions.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.035 align:middle line:84%
And then you take and
take actually arbitrary

00:07:36.035 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:84%
linear superposition
of them because we

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.400 align:middle line:90%
are solving linear equations--

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.620 align:middle line:84%
similarly for v.
And you can take

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:84%
the arbitrary linear
superposition of these

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.145 align:middle line:90%
and then you will solve them.

00:07:47.145 --> 00:07:50.450 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And then for general
uk and vk, you

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.520 align:middle line:84%
can just perform a
Lorentz transformation.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.610 align:middle line:84%
So you can perform
Lorentz transformation.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Say, the uk is obtained by
S lambda uk 0 u0 and vk is

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.650 align:middle line:90%
given by S lambda v0.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:26.150 align:middle line:90%


00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.330 align:middle line:84%
So the lambda-- so remember,
our notation, S lambda,

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.284 align:middle line:84%
is a Lorentz transformation
on the spinors.

00:08:32.284 --> 00:08:34.159 align:middle line:84%
So the Lorentz transformation
on the spinors.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And the lambda is
just determined

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:46.790 align:middle line:84%
by the Lorentz transformation
to take this k0 to k.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:51.060 align:middle line:84%
So for arbitrary--
so we take k0,

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:84%
so we make the Lorentz
transformation to k,

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.940 align:middle line:90%
and then the corresponding uk.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.670 align:middle line:90%
Then, it's getting by that.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:04.340 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:09.130 align:middle line:84%
But in practice, if I give
you an arbitrary, say--

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:14.590 align:middle line:84%
yeah, give you arbitrary k, and
you first work out the lambda,

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.380 align:middle line:84%
then you have to work
out this S lambda.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So working s lambda is possible,
but again, takes some effort.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.080 align:middle line:84%
But there's still
a lot of shortcut.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.590 align:middle line:84%
We can actually
find the solution.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.535 align:middle line:84%
So this is one way to do it,
and there's alternative way.

00:09:30.535 --> 00:09:39.987 align:middle line:90%


00:09:39.987 --> 00:09:41.820 align:middle line:84%
So before I talk about
this alternative way,

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:90%
do you have any questions?

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is more or
less where we stopped--

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.285 align:middle line:84%
so at the end of--
before the break.

00:09:48.285 --> 00:09:53.070 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:56.240 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.980 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:02.635 align:middle line:84%
So alternatively, we can
actually find a simpler way.

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:06.540 align:middle line:90%


00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:12.160 align:middle line:84%
So the simpler way is by
observing an identity--

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.800 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.950 align:middle line:84%
you say, if you look
at the k slash square--

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:22.240 align:middle line:84%
so you have done something
similar in your pset--

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.940 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the
k slash square--

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:32.110 align:middle line:84%
so this quantity, by definition,
is k mu gamma mu k nu gamma

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:36.780 align:middle line:84%
nu And then you use the
properties of gamma mu

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:42.000 align:middle line:84%
and gamma nu, and then you
can easily convince yourself

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.800 align:middle line:84%
this is just giving
you the k squared.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.570 align:middle line:84%
This just gives
you the k square.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And then-- because we are
looking at on-shell solution,

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.650 align:middle line:84%
so this is just equal
to minus m squared.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:59.470 align:middle line:90%


00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Then, this means that if
I have ik slash plus m--

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.980 align:middle line:90%


00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.740 align:middle line:84%
which-- so up here in
the equation for u and v

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:90%
are plus or minus m.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And then if I multiply
by i k slash minus m--

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.160 align:middle line:90%


00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.560 align:middle line:84%
and then essentially I have
minus k slash square minus m

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:35.630 align:middle line:84%
square, and this is
actually equal to 0

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:36.785 align:middle line:90%
because of this equation.

00:11:36.785 --> 00:11:44.520 align:middle line:90%


00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.320 align:middle line:84%
So now we can
immediately observe--

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.860 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:54.720 align:middle line:84%
so now, we can immediately
observe if I take a solution--

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.200 align:middle line:90%


00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:04.630 align:middle line:84%
if I just-- to
solve that equation,

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:15.640 align:middle line:84%
you can just write u as say
some normalization constant--

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.504 align:middle line:84%
N will be a normalization
constant-- and i k

00:12:18.504 --> 00:12:20.080 align:middle line:90%
slash plus m.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.230 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And then they're acting on
some arbitrary u tilde--

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.850 align:middle line:90%
some arbitrary spinor.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.710 align:middle line:90%
And then this equation--

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.840 align:middle line:84%
that equation
automatically satisfies.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.380 align:middle line:90%


00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, v, if I take
some normalization constant,

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and I take minus
i k slash plus m--

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.590 align:middle line:90%
say some v tilde--

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.740 align:middle line:84%
so that equation, again,
automatically-- the v equation

00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:00.010 align:middle line:84%
automatically satisfied
because of this identity.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And now, we know
that there's only two

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.120 align:middle line:90%
independent equations--

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:11.210 align:middle line:84%
two independent solutions
for both u and v,

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:15.420 align:middle line:90%
so we can choose a basis for u.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:19.035 align:middle line:84%
And just by taking
this to be, say, us 0--

00:13:19.035 --> 00:13:25.730 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:28.340 align:middle line:90%
and then this would be a basis--

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.400 align:middle line:90%
a complete basis of solutions.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.000 align:middle line:90%
So s would go 1 to 2.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.890 align:middle line:84%
So because we have--
and for each of them,

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.720 align:middle line:84%
we have two
independent solutions.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.910 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason we
can choose us here--

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:47.270 align:middle line:84%
you can also check that
when you take the m--

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.580 align:middle line:90%
when you take the to be--

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so when you
take k to be k0--

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:57.350 align:middle line:84%
so you can easily check
yourself that this equation--

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:02.800 align:middle line:84%
this essentially just
reduced to a us 0.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, this is consistent--

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.150 align:middle line:90%
just say when you take that--

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.590 align:middle line:90%
you just reduce to this basis.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.830 align:middle line:90%


00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:13.780 align:middle line:84%
So n is a
normalization constant.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:26.270 align:middle line:90%


00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And so the us vs then
provides a basis--

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.740 align:middle line:84%
then this is a
basis of solutions.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:45.220 align:middle line:90%


00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And we can be sure these
are the complete basis

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:50.890 align:middle line:90%
because that's the only--

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:56.110 align:middle line:84%
yeah, essentially, we already
know the solution at the rest

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:59.710 align:middle line:84%
frame, and we just
have the right number

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.080 align:middle line:90%
of the independent solutions.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.087 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:15:03.087 --> 00:15:05.170 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: How do we know
the normalization constant

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.090 align:middle line:90%
is the same for uv?

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:11.800 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah,
here, we don't know.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.390 align:middle line:84%
But you can guess why
it should be the same.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.820 align:middle line:84%
It's just essentially--
so this u-- yeah,

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.040 align:middle line:84%
because the equation
looks pretty symmetric

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.160 align:middle line:84%
and the normalization constant
don't depend on the sign of m,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.060 align:middle line:90%
essentially.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:28.340 align:middle line:90%


00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, in principle, I
should write in 1 and 2.

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just-- but in the
end, they are the same.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.040 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.920 align:middle line:90%
Any other questions?

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.070 align:middle line:90%


00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:47.220 align:middle line:90%
So you can also--

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:51.150 align:middle line:84%
yeah, if you take the conjugate,
then you can get the--

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:57.000 align:middle line:84%
what's the u dagger or the
u bar or v dagger v bar.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.790 align:middle line:84%
So for example, you
just take the conjugate,

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.460 align:middle line:90%
then you find the us bar.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:07.380 align:middle line:84%
So I hope you still remember
the notation-- the us bar--

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:12.390 align:middle line:84%
which is the us dagger times
gamma 0 and the us bar--

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:16.590 align:middle line:84%
so this is for the conjugate
solution-- will be an--

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:17.370 align:middle line:90%
the same n.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:18.900 align:middle line:90%
We can take n to be real--

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:25.830 align:middle line:84%
say, us bar 0, then
i k slash plus m.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:29.310 align:middle line:84%
So you just use the
properties of the--

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:43.250 align:middle line:90%


00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:44.510 align:middle line:90%
so you can also find this.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.530 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.820 align:middle line:84%
So now you can easily
check yourself again using

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.540 align:middle line:90%
this equation--

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:57.440 align:middle line:84%
you can check that the
u bar and the v bar

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.900 align:middle line:84%
are actually-- u
and v are orthogonal

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.260 align:middle line:90%
in the following sense.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And ur bar vs is
equal to v bar r us

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:15.680 align:middle line:84%
is equal to 0 for arbitrary
r, s equal to 1 and 2.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.540 align:middle line:90%
So u and v are orthogonal.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:24.630 align:middle line:90%


00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:27.200 align:middle line:90%
And we can also --

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:32.180 align:middle line:84%
and then we need to fix the
normalization of u and v.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:36.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's convenient to fix
the normalization as follows.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.320 align:middle line:84%
So we will use the
following convention--

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:44.240 align:middle line:90%
say us bar k--

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:56.510 align:middle line:84%
say, ur k u bar and us k
equal to i 2 m delta rs.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:18:05.965 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, vr bar
k and vs k - i 2m.

00:18:05.965 --> 00:18:17.790 align:middle line:90%


00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.150 align:middle line:84%
So these 2m just
for convenience.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:24.600 align:middle line:84%
So it just convention
for convenience.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And so you can check
yourself that actually--

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:37.676 align:middle line:90%
yeah, so different u--

00:18:37.676 --> 00:18:39.540 align:middle line:84%
different value of
r and s, they're

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:40.790 align:middle line:90%
also orthogonal to each other.

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:45.020 align:middle line:84%
You can already see
already in the rest frame.

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.960 align:middle line:84%
You can just easily check
using those expressions,

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.305 align:middle line:84%
but you can also check
again using this identity

00:18:51.305 --> 00:18:53.510 align:middle line:84%
that the different
value of r and s,

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.110 align:middle line:84%
they are orthogonal
to each other.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And when they are
the same, and then we

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:02.620 align:middle line:84%
normalize the
constant to be 2 m.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And from here, you
can deduce that N

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:13.850 align:middle line:84%
is equal to 1 over square
root E plus M. So from now on,

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:17.230 align:middle line:84%
I will also use
this notation for E.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:22.630 align:middle line:84%
So the E-- the
energy is omega k.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:25.135 align:middle line:84%
So now, I will also
use this notation.

00:19:25.135 --> 00:19:37.970 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:38.540 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.010 align:middle line:84%
So this gives you
a complete basis

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:46.240 align:middle line:84%
of solutions to the
Dirac equations.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.430 align:middle line:84%
So now, let me just
write them down

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.460 align:middle line:84%
to give you a
little bit intuition

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.420 align:middle line:90%
about the explicit expression.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So with those gamma matrices,
we can just plug in here.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.200 align:middle line:90%
And we know what the us 0 vs 0.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.280 align:middle line:84%
We know n, so in principle, we
can write them down explicitly.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.270 align:middle line:84%
So you find that in that
basis, then the us k

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:14.110 align:middle line:90%
is given by the following--

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:22.730 align:middle line:84%
given by the square
root E plus M xi s,

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:33.770 align:middle line:84%
and the sigma dot k divided
by square root E plus M xi s.

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:37.090 align:middle line:90%


00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And the vs k is
given by sigma dot

00:20:49.750 --> 00:21:05.500 align:middle line:84%
k divided by square root E plus
M also xi s, and E plus M xi s.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.210 align:middle line:90%
And xi s is a 2.

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:13.400 align:middle line:90%
So s from 1 to 2, and xi 1--

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.860 align:middle line:84%
so psi s are two
component vectors.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:21.560 align:middle line:84%
One is given by 1, 0, and
the other is given by 0, 1.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:28.200 align:middle line:90%


00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.250 align:middle line:90%
So that you get--

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:37.510 align:middle line:84%
so you can see in
the rest frame,

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:39.940 align:middle line:84%
k equal to 0--
essentially, for u,

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:45.440 align:middle line:84%
you're just left with the
upper half because this is 0.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the
1, 0 and the 0, 1.

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:51.140 align:middle line:90%
And then when k equal to 0--

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.630 align:middle line:84%
and for v, just left
with a lower half.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And again, we have
the 1, 0 and the 0, 1.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.470 align:middle line:84%
So this is consistent
with the rest frame result

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:03.690 align:middle line:90%
we obtained earlier.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:04.190 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:05.110 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:07.460 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: What are the
sig -- what's sigma?

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.890 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Oh, sigma
just the sigma matrix.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So this sigma just
Pauli matrices.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.100 align:middle line:90%
Sigma 1, sigma 2, sigma 3--

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:15.970 align:middle line:90%
Pauli matrices.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:22.974 align:middle line:90%


00:22:22.974 --> 00:22:23.474 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:22:23.474 --> 00:22:27.910 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:30.580 align:middle line:90%
So let me just mention a few--

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:84%
make a few remarks
on the solutions.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And to be familiar with the
properties of the solutions

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.690 align:middle line:84%
actually will be very
useful when later you

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:51.280 align:middle line:84%
do Feynman diagram calculations,
because the different--

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:56.020 align:middle line:84%
when you involve, say,
electron fermions-- and now,

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:57.670 align:middle line:90%
it's no longer plane wave.

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:02.240 align:middle line:84%
So this u and v will enter your
Feynman diagram calculations.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you are familiar
with their properties--

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:08.830 align:middle line:84%
and will help you to
do such calculations.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:12.700 align:middle line:84%
So let me just first
mention some properties.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:17.120 align:middle line:90%


00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.860 align:middle line:90%
Make some remarks.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.375 align:middle line:84%
So first is that if we consider
the non-relativistic limit--

00:23:23.375 --> 00:23:27.310 align:middle line:90%


00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:30.250 align:middle line:84%
the non-relativistic limit-- so
that's corresponding to-- you

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:37.180 align:middle line:84%
take the magnitude of k
divided by m goes to 0.

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And then in this limit, E would
be approximately equal to m.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:46.050 align:middle line:90%


00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And then you find
the leading order

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:52.590 align:middle line:84%
when you expand, say, in-- yeah,
so you can expand this in 1

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:59.540 align:middle line:84%
over M. So the
leading order, you

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:05.160 align:middle line:84%
find that the us k-- so you
can just easily do these two.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, so this
term, certainly, you

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.410 align:middle line:90%
can just ignore because E--

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:12.450 align:middle line:90%
so this is M--

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:15.000 align:middle line:84%
so this is k divided
by square root of M,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.380 align:middle line:84%
so this is higher
order than this one.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And here, it's the
square root of M.

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:28.250 align:middle line:84%
So to leading order, you
have square root 2m xi s 0.

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, vs k equal to
square root of 2m leading order

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:38.770 align:middle line:90%
0 xi s.

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:45.490 align:middle line:90%


00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, what you see
in the non-relativistic limit--

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:57.150 align:middle line:84%
for example, if we look at this
positive energy solutions--

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:01.470 align:middle line:84%
so this just reduced
to arbitrary--

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:06.660 align:middle line:84%
so us k-- yeah, now you can
do linear superposition--

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:22.520 align:middle line:84%
just uk just reduce to arbitrary
two component complex vector.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:30.580 align:middle line:90%


00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so you just--

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:34.450 align:middle line:90%
so this is just some constant.

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And as a basis, you
just have this basis,

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.820 align:middle line:84%
and then you can just
now do arbitrary-- yeah,

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.920 align:middle line:84%
just become the
arbitrary complex vector.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:49.900 align:middle line:84%
So the should remind you how we
describe a spin-half particle

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:51.670 align:middle line:90%
in non-relativistic limit.

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:55.510 align:middle line:84%
In the non-relativistic
limit, the way

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:58.720 align:middle line:84%
we describe the
spin-half particle--

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's precisely a
two-component vector.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So so this is exactly
as the description

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:23.705 align:middle line:90%
of a spin-half particle.

00:26:23.705 --> 00:26:26.450 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:29.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the wave function--

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.950 align:middle line:84%
yeah, here, you
should understand

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:33.290 align:middle line:84%
this-- the wave
function description

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:37.610 align:middle line:84%
of the spin-half particle
in non-relativistic quantum

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:38.240 align:middle line:90%
mechanics.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:42.840 align:middle line:90%


00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And as I will not
go through here,

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:51.360 align:middle line:84%
but you can show in the
non-relativistic limit,

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.815 align:middle line:84%
this solution
actually decouples.

00:26:54.815 --> 00:26:56.690 align:middle line:84%
In the end, when you
solve the equation, only

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:58.640 align:middle line:90%
one half of the equation--

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.400 align:middle line:84%
one half of the
solution remains.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.474 align:middle line:84%
And actually, this
is no longer--

00:27:04.474 --> 00:27:08.130 align:middle line:84%
it just gets the
positive energy solution.

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:11.900 align:middle line:84%
So in that limit,
you essentially only

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.460 align:middle line:90%
reduce to two components.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:20.960 align:middle line:90%


00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.700 align:middle line:90%
So this is the first remark.

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is the first indication
we see that this should likely

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.580 align:middle line:90%
describe a spin-half particle.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:35.275 align:middle line:84%
The Dirac theory likely
describes a spin-half particle.

00:27:35.275 --> 00:27:38.820 align:middle line:90%


00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:44.880 align:middle line:84%
So the second limit
we can consider

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.685 align:middle line:84%
is considered the ultra
relativistic limit.

00:27:47.685 --> 00:27:59.070 align:middle line:90%


00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:04.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is a limit which
E is much greater than--

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:08.130 align:middle line:84%
energy is much greater
than M. And E then

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:13.665 align:middle line:84%
will be approximate, say, to
k-- to the magnitude of k.

00:28:13.665 --> 00:28:16.310 align:middle line:90%


00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And now let's also
define the direction of k

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:26.150 align:middle line:84%
by just k divided
by its magnitude.

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:30.590 align:middle line:84%
So we also introduced the
k hat is the unit vector

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.000 align:middle line:90%
along the direction of the k.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.390 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, you can
do a small m expansion--

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:41.890 align:middle line:84%
just do a small expansion--
this expression for u and v.

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And then you find
the leading order--

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:52.500 align:middle line:90%
us k given by square root of E.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:29:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you have xi s, and
then you have sigma k hat xi s.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.850 align:middle line:90%
This is for the us.

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:06.470 align:middle line:90%
And for the vs, you find--

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:24.090 align:middle line:90%


00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:27.790 align:middle line:84%
so that's the-- so you find
that solution simplify,

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:30.480 align:middle line:84%
and so that's the
result you get.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:36.330 align:middle line:90%


00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's not manifest
from this expression,

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:49.960 align:middle line:84%
but actually, there's something
very special in this simplified

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.580 align:middle line:84%
expression in the ultra
relativistic limit.

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.970 align:middle line:90%
So if you look at--

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:59.120 align:middle line:90%
so the expression for u and v--

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:03.140 align:middle line:84%
these are linearly independent,
in the sense that no matter how

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:05.240 align:middle line:84%
you do linear
superposition of u,

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.310 align:middle line:90%
you will not be able to get v.

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And also how you do
linear superposition of v,

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:13.010 align:middle line:90%
you won't get u.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:16.310 align:middle line:84%
But in this limit, even
though it's not clear--

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:19.110 align:middle line:84%
not manifest in this
form, but in fact,

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:23.480 align:middle line:84%
these two are linearly
related to each other.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:27.390 align:middle line:90%
So this can be seen as follows.

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:46.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you use the identity
that's sigma dot k square--

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:51.610 align:middle line:84%
so this is the analog of
this equation for the sigma

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:52.600 align:middle line:90%
matrices--

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.460 align:middle line:90%
for the Pauli matrices.

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And this, you can
easily-- again,

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.000 align:middle line:84%
using the property
of Pauli matrices,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.880 align:middle line:84%
you can convince yourself
that this is just

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.410 align:middle line:90%
giving you k hat squared.

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:05.440 align:middle line:90%


00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.060 align:middle line:90%
And this is actually--

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:10.540 align:middle line:84%
because this is unit
vector, this is just 1.

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:16.440 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you use this
property, this is equal to 1.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.480 align:middle line:90%
And then we find--

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:25.800 align:middle line:84%
and then let eta s
equal to sigma k--

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:30.600 align:middle line:90%
sigma dot k hat xi s.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And then you find that
the vs k can be written

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:37.110 align:middle line:90%
in the exact form as us k.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:39.630 align:middle line:90%
You just replace eta s by--

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:41.010 align:middle line:90%
xi s by eta s.

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And then you can have it
in the following form--

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:56.840 align:middle line:84%
square root E eta s
sigma dot k eta s.

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.270 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, this
is equivalent to that

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:03.050 align:middle line:84%
once you plug in the eta
s equal to sigma k psi s,

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:05.660 align:middle line:84%
because this just
gives you that.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And when you plug in to here,
you get the sigma k square,

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.390 align:middle line:84%
and you get 1, and again,
you reduce to that.

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:14.380 align:middle line:90%


00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:23.530 align:middle line:84%
But now, this have exactly
the same form as this one,

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:29.980 align:middle line:84%
except now eta s is a linear
superposition of the xi s.

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Then that means that the vs is a
linear superposition of the us.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:43.870 align:middle line:84%
So this means that the vs is
a linear superposition of vs.

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:59.980 align:middle line:84%
So vs now is a linear
superposition of vs-- of us.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.200 align:middle line:84%
So they are no
longer independent,

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:10.690 align:middle line:84%
so they are not
linear independent.

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:20.050 align:middle line:90%


00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:24.700 align:middle line:84%
So actually, if you
remember one of the ways

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.970 align:middle line:84%
we have discussed before,
this may not appear a surprise

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:31.150 align:middle line:84%
to you, because
previously, we already

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:36.400 align:middle line:84%
discussed when we derive
the Dirac equation.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:39.900 align:middle line:84%
So Dirac equation--
in order to satisfy

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:43.590 align:middle line:84%
all the properties
for non-zero M,

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:47.940 align:middle line:84%
we need four
dimensional matrices.

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So that means psi
is a four vector.

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:55.490 align:middle line:84%
But we also mentioned that
if you in the massless case

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:57.670 align:middle line:90%
set m equal to 0--

00:33:57.670 --> 00:33:59.350 align:middle line:84%
in the massless
case, actually, you

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:03.470 align:middle line:84%
can use two components--
just use gamma matrices.

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:06.520 align:middle line:84%
So that means that if you solve
a massless Dirac equation,

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:10.150 align:middle line:84%
you only need-- you only have
two independent solutions.

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And this ultrarelativistic
limit is precisely

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:14.980 align:middle line:84%
like the massless limit
because the mass--

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.960 align:middle line:84%
the energy is much
greater than the mass,

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:20.800 align:middle line:84%
and then you can neglect
the effect of mass.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.360 align:middle line:90%
So this is consistent--

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.489 align:middle line:90%


00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:43.080 align:middle line:84%
with that the massless Dirac
equation consistent with that--

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:55.750 align:middle line:84%
only requires two components
rather than four components.

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:59.510 align:middle line:90%


00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:00.603 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:35:00.603 --> 00:35:02.395 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So in the
ultrarelativistic limit,

00:35:02.395 --> 00:35:07.488 align:middle line:84%
theyre linearly related, but
that relationship v bar times u

00:35:07.488 --> 00:35:10.300 align:middle line:90%
equals 0 still holds, right?

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:13.983 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that you have
to be a little bit careful.

00:35:13.983 --> 00:35:15.400 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Does that
mean that's not

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.775 align:middle line:84%
to be thought of as an inner
product on the spinor space?

00:35:17.775 --> 00:35:21.380 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so that's
a very good question.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.890 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be
careful a little bit--

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:27.585 align:middle line:84%
and when you take the limit
in deriving that relation.

00:35:27.585 --> 00:35:29.825 align:middle line:90%


00:35:29.825 --> 00:35:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, just you have
to be a little more

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:33.920 align:middle line:90%
careful in understanding.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I forgot the exact--

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:37.598 align:middle line:84%
what's exactly happened
to that equation,

00:35:37.598 --> 00:35:39.223 align:middle line:84%
but I remember there's
some subtleties.

00:35:39.223 --> 00:35:40.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you have to be.

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:44.200 align:middle line:90%


00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:44.700 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:45.540 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:51.650 align:middle line:90%


00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:55.520 align:middle line:84%
So also there are some
other useful relations

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.170 align:middle line:90%
which will be useful later.

00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:00.890 align:middle line:90%
So one of them--

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:03.320 align:middle line:84%
so let me also list
some useful relations.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:17.200 align:middle line:90%


00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:24.010 align:middle line:84%
So why is that if you
look at ur dagger and us--

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:29.110 align:middle line:90%
so this is k us k--

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:33.580 align:middle line:84%
again, this is orthogonal
between r and s.

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And then it's
given by 2e dot rs.

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:41.300 align:middle line:90%
So here it's bar.

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.870 align:middle line:90%
So the difference here is bar.

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have a bar,
you have additional gamma 0.

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And then here is 2m, and
then here it becomes 2E.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And here, you have additional
i because you have a gamma

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:59.110 align:middle line:84%
0 because gamma 0-- remember,
gamma 0 square 2 minus 1.

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.750 align:middle line:84%
So gamma 0 has
actually eigenvalue

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:05.110 align:middle line:84%
to be pure imaginary, so that's
why there's a difference in i

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:07.610 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, the vr dagger k
and vs k equal to 2E delta is.

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:23.400 align:middle line:90%


00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:25.920 align:middle line:90%
So those expressions to--

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:31.840 align:middle line:90%


00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:38.720 align:middle line:84%
yeah, will be very useful
later when you actually

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.030 align:middle line:90%
do calculations.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:59.320 align:middle line:90%


00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I forgot to
mention-- yeah,

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:04.360 align:middle line:84%
the reason is that-- the
reason that limit is subtle

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:07.780 align:middle line:84%
when you do that is because you
remember the normalization we

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:12.400 align:middle line:84%
do here is m, and so you have to
change your normalization when

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.250 align:middle line:90%
you go to the massless case.

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so there's various
things you have to be careful.

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:22.180 align:middle line:90%


00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:25.320 align:middle line:84%
So you have that,
and then you also

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:34.030 align:middle line:84%
have the relation
that the ur dagger k--

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:37.570 align:middle line:84%
so because everything is
on-shell so in principle,

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:38.650 align:middle line:90%
I can only--

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:41.640 align:middle line:84%
I only need to specify
the spatial momentum.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:45.880 align:middle line:84%
So for convenience, let me just
specifier the spatial momentum,

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.890 align:middle line:90%
which is easier in notation.

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:57.180 align:middle line:84%
So now it turns
out ur and the vs--

00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:58.860 align:middle line:90%
so now it's a dagger.

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:01.740 align:middle line:84%
When you have bar,
they're orthogonal.

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:04.360 align:middle line:90%
We have the expression there.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.500 align:middle line:84%
But then you have
dagger, it turns out

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.440 align:middle line:90%
it's orthogonal to minus k.

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:14.130 align:middle line:84%
You have to reverse
your spatial momentum,

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:24.210 align:middle line:84%
and this is equal to
vr k and us minus k.

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:28.700 align:middle line:84%
So this is equal to 0, but this
is actually not equal to 0.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:32.170 align:middle line:90%


00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:42.570 align:middle line:84%
ur dagger k us vs k is
actually not equal to 0.

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:44.460 align:middle line:90%
So they're not orthogonal.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Only the bar relation
is orthogonal,

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and then this relation
is orthogonal.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.910 align:middle line:90%


00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And similarly with
the conjugate of this.

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:59.380 align:middle line:84%
So those relations
you can just check

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:04.930 align:middle line:84%
them using explicit form
of those expressions.

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And we have this
correction here.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:10.030 align:middle line:84%
You can just check those
expression is true.

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:13.870 align:middle line:90%
And so I will not go into that.

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:18.080 align:middle line:84%
But actually, more remarkably,
those expressions--

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:21.370 align:middle line:84%
so when we derive
this expression,

00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:25.300 align:middle line:84%
we actually use the explicit
form of the gamma matrices.

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.380 align:middle line:90%
It depends on the explicit form.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So those expressions
depend on explicit form

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.800 align:middle line:90%
of these gamma matrices.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a different
set of gamma matrices,

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:35.470 align:middle line:90%
then you get different forms.

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:39.080 align:middle line:84%
But of course, physically,
they're all equivalent.

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.140 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out that
those relations--

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:44.100 align:middle line:90%


00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.280 align:middle line:84%
so those relations actually
are independent of the choice

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:50.210 align:middle line:90%
of gamma matrices.

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:58.230 align:middle line:90%
So let me just label them by--

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:02.220 align:middle line:84%
let me call it star,
and here by star star.

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:06.150 align:middle line:90%


00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:27.810 align:middle line:84%
So star and star are actually
independent of choice

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:31.235 align:middle line:84%
of representations
of gamma matrices.

00:41:31.235 --> 00:41:34.790 align:middle line:90%


00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:40.290 align:middle line:84%
So they're actually universal
for any choice of matrices.

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:44.240 align:middle line:84%
So this is very useful because
when you do calculations,

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:48.770 align:middle line:84%
then you don't have to worry
about which choice of gamma

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:53.572 align:middle line:84%
matrices you make, and
those expressions are true.

00:41:53.572 --> 00:41:57.620 align:middle line:90%


00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:06.320 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually
derive those expressions

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:10.310 align:middle line:84%
without using gamma
matrices-- just abstractly

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:15.650 align:middle line:84%
only using the properties
of the Dirac equation itself

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:18.620 align:middle line:84%
and the general properties
of gamma matrices

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:23.120 align:middle line:84%
without using explicit
representations.

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:23.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:25.730 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So is the
other normalization one

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:28.885 align:middle line:90%
dependent on representation?

00:42:28.885 --> 00:42:29.760 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Which one?

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.880 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: The one with ur bar v.

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.580 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, that also does
not depend on representation.

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that also does not--

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:39.890 align:middle line:84%
or this normalization does not
depend on the representation.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:42.710 align:middle line:90%
But this expression somehow is--

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:44.280 align:middle line:84%
yeah, that's just
our definition.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.990 align:middle line:90%
We just define them this way.

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:48.320 align:middle line:90%
We define them in this way.

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So this just follows from
those general expressions

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:53.740 align:middle line:90%
just from this equation.

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:58.330 align:middle line:84%
But this equation is less
obvious because without gamma

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:01.690 align:middle line:84%
0, then it's less
directly related

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:04.370 align:middle line:90%
to the Dirac equation itself.

00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:07.330 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out this
expression also independent

00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:09.220 align:middle line:90%
of the choice of gamma matrices.

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:14.160 align:middle line:90%


00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.230 align:middle line:90%
Any other questions?

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:17.770 align:middle line:90%


00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:21.220 align:middle line:84%
I can give you a
derivation of this

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:24.310 align:middle line:90%
without using gamma matrices.

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:27.460 align:middle line:84%
but that take a few minutes,
So I will skip that.

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:29.140 align:middle line:90%
You can read it in Peskin.

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:32.905 align:middle line:84%
So Peskin has a
derivation of this.

00:43:32.905 --> 00:43:35.680 align:middle line:90%


00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.180 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:41.290 align:middle line:90%


00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:44.470 align:middle line:84%
But you should remember this
yourself-- just remember it.

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:49.680 align:middle line:90%


00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:53.610 align:middle line:84%
So the first remark is
that often we actually need

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:57.740 align:middle line:90%
to use the projection--

00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:01.820 align:middle line:84%
so you can also
construct projections--

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:13.415 align:middle line:84%
projectors to the positive and
the negative solution space--

00:44:13.415 --> 00:44:19.900 align:middle line:90%


00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:20.400 align:middle line:90%
spaces.

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.960 align:middle line:90%


00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:54.020 align:middle line:84%
So consider-- so the projector
to the space spanned by us

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:55.920 align:middle line:90%
can be defined as the follows.

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:59.720 align:middle line:90%
So let me call it p plus.

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:03.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is just
from 2i m, so that's

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:06.040 align:middle line:90%
coming from the normalization.

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:16.507 align:middle line:84%
Then, just sum s equal to
1 and 2 us k and us bar k.

00:45:16.507 --> 00:45:19.860 align:middle line:90%


00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:23.160 align:middle line:84%
So you can easily
check yourself because

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:26.050 align:middle line:90%
of orthogonal relations--

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:29.740 align:middle line:84%
or because u and
v are orthogonal.

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:33.280 align:middle line:84%
When you act this on
the general solution,

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.460 align:middle line:84%
we'll just project into
solutions proportional

00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:39.220 align:middle line:84%
that only involve linear
superpositions of u.

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:41.870 align:middle line:90%


00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:50.710 align:middle line:84%
So now, you can check
yourself explicitly with this.

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:52.480 align:middle line:90%
So just use various--

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.785 align:middle line:90%
use property of this u.

00:45:53.785 --> 00:45:55.810 align:middle line:84%
You can check yourself
explicitly with your--

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:57.160 align:middle line:90%
I will not do there.

00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And you can check that
this is indeed a projector.

00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:07.140 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the p squared,
it gives back to itself.

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:12.570 align:middle line:90%


00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And with a little
bit more effort,

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:21.270 align:middle line:84%
you can further show
that the p plus can be

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:23.910 align:middle line:90%
written in the following form.

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:27.330 align:middle line:90%
ik slash plus m divided by 2m.

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:31.940 align:middle line:90%


00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So this requires a
little bit more effort

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:38.570 align:middle line:84%
so I will leave as an
exercise for yourself,

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:42.810 align:middle line:90%
or you can get it from the book.

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:48.250 align:middle line:90%


00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, you can
define the projector

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:57.710 align:middle line:84%
to the space of v.
So the p minus--

00:46:57.710 --> 00:47:02.930 align:middle line:84%
you can also define p
minus to be minus 2 im

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:05.460 align:middle line:90%
because of the minus sign here.

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:15.030 align:middle line:84%
So 1 over minus 2 im
some s vs k vs bar k.

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And you can show that
this also have a--

00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:21.120 align:middle line:84%
can be written as
something like this--

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:27.490 align:middle line:84%
minus ik slash plus
m divided by 2m.

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:31.580 align:middle line:84%
So again, this I will leave
as an exercise to yourself.

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:37.340 align:middle line:84%
So this is the projector
to the space of v's.

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And then from these
two expression,

00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:59.140 align:middle line:84%
p plus p minus-- you easily
see that p plus plus p minus

00:47:59.140 --> 00:47:59.785 align:middle line:90%
equal to 1.

00:47:59.785 --> 00:48:03.430 align:middle line:90%


00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And you see the
expression I just erased--

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:11.320 align:middle line:84%
so from the-- taking the
product and the p plus p

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:15.520 align:middle line:84%
minus is equal to p
minus p plus equal to 0.

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.430 align:middle line:84%
So indeed, they are just
projectors-- orthogonal

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:20.455 align:middle line:90%
projectors into different space.

00:48:20.455 --> 00:48:23.970 align:middle line:90%


00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:28.020 align:middle line:84%
So this concludes our discussion
of the classical solutions

00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:31.330 align:middle line:84%
of Dirac equations
and their properties.

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:35.410 align:middle line:90%
So do you have other questions?

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:36.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:38.153 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So we've seen
hints that this corresponds

00:48:38.153 --> 00:48:41.440 align:middle line:84%
to spin 1/2, but wouldn't
it make more sense

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.990 align:middle line:84%
to just define the
angular momentum operator

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:46.550 align:middle line:84%
and see whether it has
eigenvalues or not?

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:49.780 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that you would
need to quantize the theory,

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:52.840 align:middle line:84%
but we haven't
quantized the theory.

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that would
be our next step.

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:58.940 align:middle line:84%
So once we have found the full
set of classical solutions

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:00.590 align:middle line:90%
and now we can quantize it.

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:04.538 align:middle line:84%
And once quantize it, then
we can actually really find

00:49:04.538 --> 00:49:05.455 align:middle line:90%
this angular momentum.

00:49:05.455 --> 00:49:08.080 align:middle line:90%


00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:09.190 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, actually,
I think that would

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:16.450 align:middle line:84%
be one of your pset
problems to show yourself

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:17.590 align:middle line:90%
that this is spin-half.

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:20.410 align:middle line:90%


00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:23.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, but yeah.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:23.950 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:27.190 align:middle line:90%


00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.900 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:31.160 align:middle line:90%


00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.800 align:middle line:84%
So now we conclude
the discussion.

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.225 align:middle line:90%
Now we can quantize the theory.

00:49:35.225 --> 00:49:44.680 align:middle line:90%


00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.885 align:middle line:84%
Now we can go to
the quantum system.

00:49:46.885 --> 00:49:58.730 align:middle line:90%


00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:06.270 align:middle line:84%
So the-- remember, the
action for the Dirac

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:18.710 align:middle line:84%
is d4x psi bar gamma mu partial
mu psi partial mu minus m psi.

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:25.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is the action which
gives us the Dirac equation.

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:28.810 align:middle line:90%


00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:31.570 align:middle line:84%
So in order to quantize
this, we first--

00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:36.450 align:middle line:84%
remember our procedure
to quantize a theory.

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So we need to first find
the canonical momentum,

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and we also need to impose the
canonical commutation relation,

00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:50.000 align:middle line:84%
and then we expand
the operators in terms

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.807 align:middle line:84%
of complete sets of
classical solutions,

00:50:53.807 --> 00:50:56.390 align:middle line:84%
and then that's corresponding
to the solutions to the operator

00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:58.490 align:middle line:90%
equations.

00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:02.630 align:middle line:84%
So let's try to find out what's
the canonical momentum for psi.

00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:05.780 align:middle line:90%


00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:08.490 align:middle line:84%
So as in the
complex scalar case,

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:11.570 align:middle line:84%
we can treat the
psi and psi dagger

00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:15.410 align:middle line:84%
as independent variables
because of the--

00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:16.610 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:19.970 align:middle line:84%
So then the canonical
momentum for psi--

00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:22.500 align:middle line:90%
if you look at this expression.

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:26.720 align:middle line:84%
So you look at
the partial 0 psi.

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Then you find-- so the
Lagrangian density--

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:34.290 align:middle line:84%
if you look at that,
if I write it bit--

00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:37.760 align:middle line:90%
I have the form psi dagger.

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:47.790 align:middle line:84%
So this psi dagger gamma 0, and
then gamma 0 psi 0 psi, then

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:49.290 align:middle line:90%
plus the rest of the terms.

00:51:49.290 --> 00:51:51.360 align:middle line:84%
So in order to find
the canonical momentum,

00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:56.200 align:middle line:84%
we are only interested in the
part of the Lagrangian density

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.800 align:middle line:84%
which are related to the
derivative of psi-- or the time

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.000 align:middle line:90%
derivative.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
only term involving

00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:06.750 align:middle line:84%
time derivative of either
psi or psi bar or psi dagger.

00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:09.330 align:middle line:90%


00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So this gamma 0 squared
equal to minus 1--

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:19.400 align:middle line:84%
so this is just i psi
dagger partial 0 psi.

00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:23.300 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can
immediately find out

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:31.650 align:middle line:84%
that the conjugate momentum for
psi is given by i psi dagger,

00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:34.695 align:middle line:84%
because you take a
derivative on psi 0--

00:52:34.695 --> 00:52:37.290 align:middle line:84%
partial 0 psi, you
just get i psi dagger.

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:43.680 align:middle line:84%
But the conjugate
momentum for psi dagger

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:44.775 align:middle line:90%
is actually equal to what?

00:52:44.775 --> 00:52:47.710 align:middle line:90%


00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:51.406 align:middle line:90%
So what is this?

00:52:51.406 --> 00:52:52.804 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: 0.

00:52:52.804 --> 00:52:55.850 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Thi is equal to
0 because there is no time

00:52:55.850 --> 00:53:00.190 align:middle line:90%
derivative on psi dagger.

00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:01.650 align:middle line:90%
So this tells you--

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:05.440 align:middle line:90%


00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:09.350 align:middle line:84%
so this-- so the
fact that this--

00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:15.080 align:middle line:84%
equal to 0 tells you
actually the Dirac system--

00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:17.900 align:middle line:84%
the action-- this Dirac
system is actually

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:18.845 align:middle line:90%
a constrained system.

00:53:18.845 --> 00:53:23.310 align:middle line:90%


00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:26.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is considered to be
a constraint, because you

00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:29.320 align:middle line:90%
can no longer normally--

00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:36.790 align:middle line:84%
so remember, when we
say from the Lagrangian,

00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:39.670 align:middle line:84%
you find the canonical
momentum, and then

00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:42.160 align:middle line:84%
you invert the
canonical momentum

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:43.480 align:middle line:90%
to find the Hamiltonian.

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:46.310 align:middle line:90%


00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:50.300 align:middle line:84%
But when you have this equal
to 0, you cannot invert it.

00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:54.530 align:middle line:84%
You cannot express your, say,
psi or psi dagger in terms

00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:56.330 align:middle line:90%
of pi or pi dagger.

00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:58.980 align:middle line:90%
And so this is a constrained.

00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:03.695 align:middle line:84%
So that means you actually
have a constrained system.

00:54:03.695 --> 00:54:07.510 align:middle line:84%
It means you have a
constrained system.

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, constrained
systems are very annoying.

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:15.830 align:middle line:90%


00:54:15.830 --> 00:54:19.740 align:middle line:90%
So they have involved lots of--

00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:21.420 align:middle line:84%
you have a lot of
formalism in order

00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:23.400 align:middle line:84%
to, say, treat
constrained system--

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.860 align:middle line:90%
to quantize them, et cetera.

00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:27.900 align:middle line:84%
But fortunately, in
this case, there's

00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:31.710 align:middle line:84%
actually a simple
trick to go around it.

00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And so now, I will not use
this full-fledged constrained

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.460 align:middle line:90%
quantization to do the job.

00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:40.470 align:middle line:84%
I will just use a
simple trick which

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:42.150 align:middle line:90%
will reach the same answer.

00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.812 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:54:42.812 --> 00:54:44.520 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Is it like
the canonical momenta

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:46.614 align:middle line:84%
not well-defined,
because I could integrate

00:54:46.614 --> 00:54:50.091 align:middle line:84%
by parts to move around
the time derivative

00:54:50.091 --> 00:54:52.760 align:middle line:84%
because I can move the
time derivative from psi

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:54.080 align:middle line:90%
to psi dagger, right?

00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:55.740 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
there's ambiguity.

00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:58.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's part of the
reflection that this

00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:00.360 align:middle line:90%
is a constrained system.

00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So this is actually typical to
have these kind of constraints.

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:07.920 align:middle line:84%
It's typical whenever you
have a first-order system.

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.000 align:middle line:84%
So here, it's different from
the Klein-Gordon action is

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.860 align:middle line:84%
because here, we only involving
the first derivative--

00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:18.350 align:middle line:84%
one derivative rather
than two derivatives.

00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And so this is not
our standard system.

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So the way to go around
this is the following.

00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:33.230 align:middle line:84%
The way to go around
it is the following.

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:38.500 align:middle line:84%
It's now-- so this equation--
if we look at this equation--

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:42.490 align:middle line:90%


00:55:42.490 --> 00:55:44.850 align:middle line:84%
so this equation tells you
that the canonical momentum

00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:50.220 align:middle line:84%
conjugate to psi is
actually psi dagger.

00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:53.670 align:middle line:84%
So also here it's
a little bit funny,

00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:57.240 align:middle line:84%
because you remember
in the standard story,

00:55:57.240 --> 00:56:01.630 align:middle line:84%
the canonical momentum is
related to the time derivative.

00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And here, there's
no time derivative

00:56:03.130 --> 00:56:05.650 align:middle line:90%
here-- just psi dagger itself.

00:56:05.650 --> 00:56:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is another
indication that this

00:56:08.350 --> 00:56:11.440 align:middle line:90%
is a constraint rather than--

00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.130 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:20.030 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, here, it tells you
that the dagger is, in fact,

00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:22.790 align:middle line:90%
the canonical moment of psi.

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:24.670 align:middle line:90%
And now, we can just--

00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:26.530 align:middle line:84%
now in this
equation, we can just

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:30.310 align:middle line:84%
try to interpret the psi
dagger as the momentum

00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:33.040 align:middle line:84%
rather than as the
configuration variable.

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.620 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's rewrite
the Lagrangian.

00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:38.620 align:middle line:84%
So the Lagrangian has
the following form--

00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:45.910 align:middle line:84%
minus i psi bar gamma mu
partial mu minus m psi.

00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:48.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
Lagrangian density.

00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:51.260 align:middle line:84%
So we'll rewrite it
as the following.

00:56:51.260 --> 00:56:54.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's first separate
the time derivative.

00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:56.440 align:middle line:90%
So this is psi dagger.

00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So just this term involving
the time derivative.

00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest, I have
psi bar gamma i partial

00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:08.160 align:middle line:90%
i minus m psi.

00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:12.570 align:middle line:84%
But here, they are no longer
involving the time derivative.

00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And now, we just interpret
this as the canonical momentum

00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:18.180 align:middle line:90%
for psi.

00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:24.660 align:middle line:90%


00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And then this is just
something involving

00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:30.450 align:middle line:90%
spatial derivative of psi.

00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And I just interpret this
as the Hamiltonian for psi.

00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:45.440 align:middle line:90%


00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:47.120 align:middle line:84%
So this expression
just involving

00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:49.190 align:middle line:90%
psi dagger and the psi--

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:50.990 align:middle line:84%
involving some
spatial derivative.

00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And so this is essentially
just some functions of psi--

00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:59.720 align:middle line:84%
pi psi and psi and maybe with
some spatial derivatives.

00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:04.330 align:middle line:84%
So now, you see that
this Lagrangian density--

00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:07.210 align:middle line:84%
actually, if I
interpret the diagram

00:58:07.210 --> 00:58:08.770 align:middle line:84%
as the canonical
momentum, then it

00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:11.170 align:middle line:84%
has the form of this
canonical transformation

00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:14.080 align:middle line:84%
to go from the Lagrangian
density to Hamiltonian.

00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And then I can just interpret
this as the Hamiltonian.

00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:21.180 align:middle line:90%


00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:24.856 align:middle line:84%
So now, I can just interpret
this as my Hamiltonian.

00:58:24.856 --> 00:58:28.800 align:middle line:90%


00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:32.635 align:middle line:90%
So we just treat--

00:58:32.635 --> 00:59:03.010 align:middle line:90%


00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:08.900 align:middle line:90%
so now, we just--

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:14.540 align:middle line:84%
so this is-- so
psi dagger and psi.

00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And now, this is the
full phase space.

00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:21.210 align:middle line:84%
So this is the momentum
and this is the coordinate,

00:59:21.210 --> 00:59:26.318 align:middle line:84%
so this is the full space,
rather than previously, we

00:59:26.318 --> 00:59:28.235 align:middle line:84%
would interpret them as
a configuration space.

00:59:28.235 --> 00:59:31.970 align:middle line:90%


00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And then the
Hamiltonian just equal

00:59:37.690 --> 00:59:45.290 align:middle line:84%
to i psi bar gamma i
partial i minus m psi.

00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:50.290 align:middle line:90%


00:59:50.290 --> 00:59:52.000 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
Hamiltonian density.

00:59:52.000 --> 01:00:01.350 align:middle line:90%


01:00:01.350 --> 01:00:04.770 align:middle line:84%
So we now then have--
now, this just goes back

01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:06.000 align:middle line:90%
to the standard formalism.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.660 align:middle line:90%


01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:10.340 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.248 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So can we still
interpret psi dagger

01:00:13.248 --> 01:00:16.570 align:middle line:90%
as a different field than psi?

01:00:16.570 --> 01:00:19.216 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: it's
canonical momentum.

01:00:19.216 --> 01:00:21.482 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So it's no longer
two different fields?

01:00:21.482 --> 01:00:23.690 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's no
longer two different fields.

01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:26.230 align:middle line:84%
For example, if there are
two different fields, then

01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:29.110 align:middle line:84%
psi and psi dagger,
they should commute.

01:00:29.110 --> 01:00:31.300 align:middle line:84%
But now, since they
become canonical momentum,

01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:34.010 align:middle line:90%
they no longer commute.

01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:35.020 align:middle line:90%
yes?

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:37.930 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: If you take psi bar
and then you bring the, you pull

01:00:37.930 --> 01:00:42.760 align:middle line:84%
out the gamma 0, isn't this
just like the right-hand side

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:46.090 align:middle line:84%
of the-- like our earlier
version of the Dirac equation--

01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:50.944 align:middle line:84%
the one where you
like [INAUDIBLE]??

01:00:50.944 --> 01:00:52.563 align:middle line:84%
Like, the one with
the alpha and beta,

01:00:52.563 --> 01:00:54.730 align:middle line:84%
like the other Dirac equation
we wrote down earlier?

01:00:54.730 --> 01:00:56.650 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.

01:00:56.650 --> 01:00:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's very-- essentially
just that Hamiltonian.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.090 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's right.

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:02.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:05.300 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Is there not
a problem with this

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:07.725 align:middle line:90%
treating the time differently?

01:01:07.725 --> 01:01:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Is it no longer
Lorentz invariant?

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:12.060 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so when you--

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:17.790 align:middle line:84%
yeah, when we do the client
encoding equation in the scalar

01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:20.250 align:middle line:84%
theory, when you
quantize, you always

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:22.230 align:middle line:90%
have to treat time differently.

01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And then the Lorentz
symmetry come out

01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:31.830 align:middle line:90%
in the property of the state.

01:01:31.830 --> 01:01:34.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, but you always--

01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:39.520 align:middle line:84%
when you quantize, you always
have to treat time separately.

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:01:40.210 --> 01:01:40.791 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So now we have
the momentum operator,

01:01:40.791 --> 01:01:42.374 align:middle line:84%
its just the complex
conjugate of phi?

01:01:42.374 --> 01:01:47.070 align:middle line:90%


01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:48.434 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

01:01:48.434 --> 01:01:52.174 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So this like, its
still like constrained.

01:01:52.174 --> 01:01:54.665 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's a--

01:01:54.665 --> 01:02:03.240 align:middle line:90%


01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.650 align:middle line:90%
yeah, this is just--

01:02:04.650 --> 01:02:06.970 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so that's why we call
this a constrained system.

01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:09.430 align:middle line:84%
But now, I'm just
giving you a shortcut

01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:13.620 align:middle line:84%
so that we have to don't
have to go through this--

01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:18.638 align:middle line:84%
yeah, the intricacy of
constrained quantization.

01:02:18.638 --> 01:02:21.740 align:middle line:90%


01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:24.980 align:middle line:84%
So now, the canonical
quantization becomes easy.

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:28.920 align:middle line:90%
So now, this is my momentum.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:33.670 align:middle line:84%
So now, we just have the
canonical quantization.

01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:42.640 align:middle line:90%


01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.360 align:middle line:84%
I think today, we may
have unfortunate timing.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.980 align:middle line:90%
So now, become psi--

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:49.300 align:middle line:90%
is coordinate.

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:52.540 align:middle line:90%


01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:54.700 align:middle line:90%
And now, we have psi dagger.

01:02:54.700 --> 01:03:00.670 align:middle line:84%
We have pi psi, which
is the momentum.

01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:09.340 align:middle line:84%
So this, by definition, should
give you the delta function, so

01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:11.180 align:middle line:90%
equal time correlation function.

01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:12.820 align:middle line:90%
So here, we should--

01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:15.380 align:middle line:84%
because remember,
this is a four vector,

01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:17.660 align:middle line:84%
so this also have
four components.

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:22.930 align:middle line:84%
So let me just now
suppress this subscript psi

01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:26.440 align:middle line:84%
because there's only
one variable here now.

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So here, there's
also coefficient--

01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:30.850 align:middle line:84%
so this is also
four vector beta,

01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:33.520 align:middle line:84%
and then here should
be delta alpha beta.

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:35.290 align:middle line:84%
So alpha beta are
spinor indices.

01:03:35.290 --> 01:03:43.060 align:middle line:90%


01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:44.340 align:middle line:90%
So if you impose--

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and this is equivalent
just to psi alpha t,

01:03:51.190 --> 01:04:06.830 align:middle line:84%
x psi dagger beta t, x prime
equal to i delta alpha beta

01:04:06.830 --> 01:04:08.020 align:middle line:90%
x x minus prime.

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:15.480 align:middle line:90%


01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And so we can now
expand psi x in terms

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.910 align:middle line:90%
of complete set of solutions.

01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:29.380 align:middle line:84%
So this is the first
step of the quantization.

01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So first is-- this is
the commutation relation.

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:34.950 align:middle line:84%
So the second
step-- remember, we

01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:39.270 align:middle line:84%
can expand the psi in
terms of complete basis

01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:41.460 align:middle line:90%
of classical solutions.

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:45.540 align:middle line:90%
So psi x just equal to--

01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:48.465 align:middle line:84%
again, we integrate over
all spatial momentum.

01:04:48.465 --> 01:04:51.430 align:middle line:90%


01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Again, we use this
factor for convenience

01:04:55.870 --> 01:04:57.820 align:middle line:90%
as in the scalar case.

01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And now, we just need to sum
over all possible solutions.

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:09.960 align:middle line:84%
So here, we have a sum
over s equal to 1 and 2.

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:21.170 align:middle line:84%
So we have-- then we have
ak s us exponential ik x.

01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:25.115 align:middle line:90%
And then plus bk--

01:05:25.115 --> 01:05:25.615 align:middle line:90%
sorry.

01:05:25.615 --> 01:05:28.140 align:middle line:90%


01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:29.850 align:middle line:90%
k should be here-- sorry.

01:05:29.850 --> 01:05:38.840 align:middle line:84%
bk s and vs
exponential minus ik x.

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:43.940 align:middle line:90%


01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.890 align:middle line:90%
So these are the complete--

01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:50.040 align:middle line:84%
because complete set of
solution are u and v.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.935 align:middle line:84%
And we call the
coefficients of a and b,

01:05:52.935 --> 01:05:56.430 align:middle line:84%
so let me call it b dagger as we
did for the complex scalar case

01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:59.040 align:middle line:90%
before.

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:02.430 align:middle line:84%
So we-- so the coefficient,
we call them a and b.

01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:05.250 align:middle line:90%
Actually, it doesn't matter.

01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:06.930 align:middle line:90%
We call it b.

01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:08.880 align:middle line:90%
Actually, let me just call it b.

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so you can just--
you have u and v,

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:14.630 align:middle line:84%
and then the coefficient
will be a and b.

01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:19.575 align:middle line:90%


01:06:19.575 --> 01:06:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And so now, you
can just plug this.

01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:36.160 align:middle line:84%
So if this equation is 1
and this equation is 2,

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and you take the complex
conjugate, psi dagger,

01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:41.350 align:middle line:84%
you can plug it in here to
find what's the commutation

01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:42.748 align:middle line:90%
relation between a and b.

01:06:42.748 --> 01:06:46.960 align:middle line:90%


01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:51.895 align:middle line:90%
So you find that the--

01:06:51.895 --> 01:06:54.980 align:middle line:90%


01:06:54.980 --> 01:07:03.030 align:middle line:90%
yeah, so plug 2 into 1.

01:07:03.030 --> 01:07:19.750 align:middle line:84%
So you find the commutation
relation ak s ak prime p, then

01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:29.630 align:middle line:90%
equal to bk s and bk prime t.

01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Then, equal to 2 pi cubed delta
st, delta 3 k minus k prime.

01:07:39.350 --> 01:07:45.250 align:middle line:90%


01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:49.990 align:middle line:84%
So now-- and you can
also define the vacuum.

01:07:49.990 --> 01:08:15.770 align:middle line:90%


01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And all other
commutators are 0--

01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:20.494 align:middle line:90%
with all others 0.

01:08:20.494 --> 01:08:26.840 align:middle line:90%


01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And you can also
define the vacuum,

01:08:31.310 --> 01:08:40.569 align:middle line:84%
as we did for the scalar case,
to be annihilated by ak and bk.

01:08:40.569 --> 01:08:51.620 align:middle line:90%


01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And now, you can, in principle,
build your Hilbert space.

01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:56.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.943 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: For equation
one up there,

01:08:58.943 --> 01:09:04.620 align:middle line:84%
are you supposed to not have
factor pi just because momentum

01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:07.080 align:middle line:90%
is i psi dagger?

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:07.878 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:09:07.878 --> 01:09:08.670 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: And then--

01:09:08.670 --> 01:09:09.545 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Oh, right.

01:09:09.545 --> 01:09:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, there's no--
yeah, thank you.

01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:13.109 align:middle line:90%
There's no i here.

01:09:13.109 --> 01:09:15.399 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because the
momentum is i psi dagger.

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:22.859 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's no i anymore--
just the delta alpha beta.

01:09:22.859 --> 01:09:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So all look pretty
straightforward,

01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:31.269 align:middle line:90%
but you actually have problems.

01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:34.660 align:middle line:90%


01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:37.160 align:middle line:90%
You actually have problems.

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:49.170 align:middle line:84%
So the first problem some
of you may be already asking

01:09:49.170 --> 01:09:55.300 align:middle line:84%
in your head, is
that, are we supposed

01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:58.820 align:middle line:90%
to describe spin-half particles?

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:03.400 align:middle line:84%
But if we are suppose to
describe spin-half particles,

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.200 align:middle line:90%
then why do we find the bosons?

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:09.030 align:middle line:84%
So these are commutation
relations for bosons.

01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:11.760 align:middle line:90%
It's because they commute.

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:16.960 align:middle line:84%
So different k-- sorry, I
think I'm missing dagger.

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:17.460 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:20.550 align:middle line:90%


01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:25.310 align:middle line:84%
So different ak, they
commute with each other.

01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:27.140 align:middle line:84%
As we discussed in
the scalar case,

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:32.660 align:middle line:84%
when the a mu all commute with
each other, this is boson.

01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:34.190 align:middle line:84%
It means the
particle you created,

01:10:34.190 --> 01:10:38.750 align:middle line:84%
you can exchange
them and don't--

01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:41.000 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you can arbitrarily
exchange them.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.800 align:middle line:90%
It's symmetric.

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:48.542 align:middle line:84%
But fermions, they are
supposed to be Pauli principle.

01:10:48.542 --> 01:10:50.000 align:middle line:84%
So you're supposed
to get the minus

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.160 align:middle line:90%
sign when you exchange them.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.870 align:middle line:84%
So this cannot-- this
doesn't look to be right.

01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- the
first thing it seems

01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:05.720 align:middle line:84%
to be we were finding
bosons rather than fermions.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And the second is that now if
you find that the Hamiltonian--

01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:12.430 align:middle line:90%


01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:14.620 align:middle line:84%
so now, if you try to
find the Hamiltonian--

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:18.360 align:middle line:90%


01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:25.020 align:middle line:84%
so H is just the integration
of this Hamiltonian density.

01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:32.390 align:middle line:90%


01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:34.580 align:middle line:90%
And you can just plug it in--

01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:38.210 align:middle line:84%
plug that expression for
Hamiltonian density in.

01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:40.370 align:middle line:90%
Where is my Hamiltonian density?

01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, plug that in, and
then you will find the--

01:11:46.930 --> 01:11:49.970 align:middle line:90%


01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:56.300 align:middle line:84%
yeah so you find just
this just given by i d3

01:11:56.300 --> 01:12:02.420 align:middle line:84%
x psi bar gamma i
partial i minus m psi.

01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:11.790 align:middle line:90%


01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:15.990 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you plug them in, you
just plug them in-- plug this

01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:17.430 align:middle line:90%
mode expansion in--

01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:19.410 align:middle line:90%
and then you find actually--

01:12:19.410 --> 01:12:22.990 align:middle line:90%


01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:24.880 align:middle line:84%
then you find the
following expression--

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:34.580 align:middle line:90%


01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:37.190 align:middle line:90%
omega k.

01:12:37.190 --> 01:12:41.940 align:middle line:90%
And you sum over s from 1 to 2.

01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And then you find
it's given by ak

01:12:47.220 --> 01:13:05.160 align:middle line:84%
s dagger ak s minus
bk s dagger bk

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:11.290 align:middle line:84%
s, and then up to some
infinite constants.

01:13:11.290 --> 01:13:15.450 align:middle line:84%
So now, you see something
problematic here.

01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:17.250 align:middle line:90%
So what's problematic you see?

01:13:17.250 --> 01:13:22.000 align:middle line:90%


01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:22.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:24.780 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: The energy can
be arbitrarily small.

01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:27.840 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, energy
is not positive definite

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:29.070 align:middle line:90%
because of this minus sign.

01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:35.600 align:middle line:90%


01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:40.550 align:middle line:84%
So this minus sign tells
you that if you excite

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:45.140 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these b particles,
you can make the energy

01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:48.200 align:middle line:84%
as negative as you want,
and then the theory

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:49.850 align:middle line:90%
don't make sense.

01:13:49.850 --> 01:13:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And then this is a theory with
energy unbounded from below.

01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:57.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a theory with energy
unbounded from below.

01:13:57.990 --> 01:14:02.105 align:middle line:84%
So that means this
vacuum is unstable.

01:14:02.105 --> 01:14:16.970 align:middle line:90%


01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:19.760 align:middle line:84%
So there must be something
wrong with this procedure.

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:24.080 align:middle line:90%


01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:28.170 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out that there's a
very quick fix to this problem,

01:14:28.170 --> 01:14:34.160 align:middle line:84%
and this quick fix was
invented by Jordan.

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:38.660 align:middle line:84%
So he recognized
that if you don't

01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:41.240 align:middle line:84%
do the standard
commutation relation--

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:43.910 align:middle line:90%


01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:48.910 align:middle line:84%
if you do instead
of commutator--

01:14:48.910 --> 01:14:52.060 align:middle line:84%
here, you change it
to anti-commutator.

01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:59.800 align:middle line:90%


01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Remember, this bracket--
this curly bracket

01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:04.270 align:middle line:90%
means anticommutator.

01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And that means that
here, you change it

01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:15.790 align:middle line:84%
to anticommutator, and then
still with the same thing--

01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:30.490 align:middle line:90%


01:15:30.490 --> 01:15:35.040 align:middle line:84%
and now this becomes
anti-commutator.

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:48.050 align:middle line:90%


01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:49.100 align:middle line:90%
So let me see.

01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:54.380 align:middle line:90%


01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:56.520 align:middle line:84%
I just want to make
sure I get the--

01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:58.925 align:middle line:90%


01:15:58.925 --> 01:16:00.550 align:middle line:84%
yeah, if we change
anti-commutator also

01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:04.540 align:middle line:84%
from the convention, you
change this to dagger.

01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Now you change this to dagger
as we did for the complex scalar

01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:08.080 align:middle line:90%
case.

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:10.400 align:middle line:90%
And then you just get this.

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And now, if you do that, and
then this becomes plus sign.

01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:18.980 align:middle line:90%


01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And now, not only this
becomes plus sign--

01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:30.740 align:middle line:84%
and also all different ak
for different s and t--

01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:32.630 align:middle line:84%
they anti-commute
with each other.

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:42.840 align:middle line:90%


01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:45.590 align:middle line:90%
They anticommute each other.

01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So anticommute each other means
that if you create a particle--

01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:53.720 align:middle line:90%
for example, ak dagger--

01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and you create another
particle, ak prime dagger on 0,

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.635 align:middle line:90%
and now these two anticommute.

01:17:00.635 --> 01:17:04.300 align:middle line:84%
It means when you exchange
all, you get the minus sign.

01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:06.820 align:middle line:84%
That precisely gives
you the minus sign

01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:08.530 align:middle line:90%
in the Pauli principle--

01:17:08.530 --> 01:17:14.230 align:middle line:90%
in the statistics for fermions.

01:17:14.230 --> 01:17:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And so changing this thing
to the anti-commutator--

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:22.660 align:middle line:90%
and so solves all your problem.

01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And your energy now
is bounded from below,

01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:28.150 align:middle line:84%
and then you actually
now actually describe

01:17:28.150 --> 01:17:32.290 align:middle line:84%
some particles which
obey the Pauli principle.

01:17:32.290 --> 01:17:38.500 align:middle line:90%


01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:48.130 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I think we still
have 1 minute left, but we--

01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:52.540 align:middle line:84%
but it's a good time to stop,
because otherwise, other things

01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:53.900 align:middle line:90%
will take more time.

01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:57.220 align:middle line:84%
So let me just make
a couple remark

01:17:57.220 --> 01:18:02.470 align:middle line:84%
why the commutator-- why
here, you need to do something

01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:03.580 align:middle line:90%
unconventional.

01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:10.990 align:middle line:90%


01:18:10.990 --> 01:18:12.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at this
Hamiltonian density--

01:18:12.910 --> 01:18:19.290 align:middle line:90%


01:18:19.290 --> 01:18:25.240 align:middle line:84%
so even without doing
this calculation,

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:30.790 align:middle line:84%
you can already conclude from
here that this H cannot be

01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:32.920 align:middle line:84%
bounded from below for
the following reason.

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:36.320 align:middle line:90%


01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.890 align:middle line:90%
So from the Dirac equation--

01:18:38.890 --> 01:18:40.120 align:middle line:90%
let me just erase here.

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:43.390 align:middle line:90%


01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:47.230 align:middle line:84%
So from the Dirac
equation, you have

01:18:47.230 --> 01:18:53.620 align:middle line:84%
gamma mu partial mu
minus m psi equal to 0.

01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:59.230 align:middle line:84%
So that means that the gamma
i partial i minus m psi

01:18:59.230 --> 01:19:02.710 align:middle line:84%
is equal to minus
gamma 0 partial 0 psi.

01:19:02.710 --> 01:19:05.380 align:middle line:90%


01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:13.360 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you plug
this equation into here,

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.980 align:middle line:90%
and then what you get--

01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:21.670 align:middle line:84%
you should find that
H is equal to i d3

01:19:21.670 --> 01:19:26.020 align:middle line:90%
x psi dagger partial 0 psi.

01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:29.340 align:middle line:90%


01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:33.240 align:middle line:90%
So because the psi--

01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:35.010 align:middle line:84%
now this becomes a
operate equation,

01:19:35.010 --> 01:19:36.960 align:middle line:90%
and psi satisfies this equation.

01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And now, you find H
becomes this form, which

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:44.770 align:middle line:84%
is psi dagger times the
time derivative of psi.

01:19:44.770 --> 01:19:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And time derivative
of psi-- remember,

01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:51.340 align:middle line:84%
psi expanded both in terms
of the positive energy

01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:55.390 align:middle line:84%
solutions and the
negative energy solutions.

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:57.750 align:middle line:84%
So depends on which
omega you have.

01:19:57.750 --> 01:20:01.200 align:middle line:84%
You can have either positive
omega negative omega,

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:03.750 align:middle line:84%
because this is the first
derivative-- a first time

01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:04.920 align:middle line:90%
derivative of psi.

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And so this cannot be
a positive definite.

01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:11.610 align:middle line:84%
So this quantity cannot
be positive definite.

01:20:11.610 --> 01:20:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Anyway-- so you have to
do something more radical.

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:21.750 align:middle line:84%
If these are
conventional functions,

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:24.720 align:middle line:84%
and then this won't
be positive definite.

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.810 align:middle line:84%
But now, what we did is that
we make these into functions

01:20:27.810 --> 01:20:29.700 align:middle line:90%
which anticommute.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.590 align:middle line:84%
When they anticommute,
turns out this

01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:35.080 align:middle line:84%
to be a positive
definite quantity.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.840 align:middle line:84%
As the ordinary function, this
cannot be positive definite.

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:41.800 align:middle line:84%
But if they anticommute, then
