[SQUEAKING][RUSTLING][CLICKING]

00:00:06.776 --> 00:00:11.140 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.520 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: OK.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.240 align:middle line:90%
Let us start.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.600 align:middle line:84%
So last time, we started talking
about interacting theories.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And here is the simplest
interacting theory

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.600 align:middle line:84%
with the Lagrangian
density of the form.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:38.360 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.560 align:middle line:84%
So this is just
the simplest one.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And we will use
this as our example

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.080 align:middle line:84%
to illustrate how you treat
interacting theories, OK--

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.770 align:middle line:84%
how you treat the particles
with interactions.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Once we understand
how to do one theory,

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.820 align:middle line:84%
essentially you will know
how to do all of them.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.370 align:middle line:90%
And we also said that the--

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:13.180 align:middle line:84%
a key quantity when talking
about interactions--

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.620 align:middle line:90%
a key observable--

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.960 align:middle line:90%
is called S-matrix.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.630 align:middle line:84%
So S-matrix is defined
as the following.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.650 align:middle line:90%
So S beta alpha beta--

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:35.740 align:middle line:84%
beta alpha equal to beta U plus
infinity minus infinity alpha.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.570 align:middle line:84%
So you start with some
alpha initial state,

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.360 align:middle line:84%
which are widely
separated, which

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.850 align:middle line:84%
you can treat as a
collections of free particles.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And then say as T goes
to minus infinity,

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.350 align:middle line:90%
they are very widely separated.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.080 align:middle line:84%
But then as time evolves,
they will come together,

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:90%
the scatter.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Then they will separate
into far future.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And so that's our
final state beta.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And so S alpha beta is
the transition amplitude

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.440 align:middle line:90%
between the two.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.940 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is the written in terms
of the Schrodinger picture.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.350 align:middle line:84%
You can also written in terms
of the Heisenberg picture,

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.110 align:middle line:84%
which is normally
written in this form.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.300 align:middle line:90%


00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.860 align:middle line:90%
So-- and we often--

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.590 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.070 align:middle line:84%
so it's often
convenient to write

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.750 align:middle line:84%
this S alpha beta separated
into identity part delta

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.310 align:middle line:84%
beta alpha and then
plus i T beta alpha.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.920 align:middle line:84%
So this will capture the
effect of the interactions.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.260 align:middle line:84%
We'll capture the effect
of the interactions.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.470 align:middle line:90%
And so-- and since the--

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.350 align:middle line:84%
such as-- yeah,
we always consider

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.670 align:middle line:84%
theories which are both spatial
and the time translation

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:90%
invariant.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.440 align:middle line:84%
So you have energy
momentum conservation.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:90%
And so i T alpha--

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.840 align:middle line:84%
i T beta alpha will always
contain a piece proportional--

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.060 align:middle line:90%
we also put i here--

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.810 align:middle line:90%
proportional to the moment--

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.532 align:middle line:90%
the momentum conservation.

00:03:27.532 --> 00:03:34.420 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.620 align:middle line:84%
So p alpha-- and the p alpha
is the total initial momentum.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:46.100 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.860 align:middle line:90%
So here is full momentum, OK?

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.570 align:middle line:90%
So I suppress the indices.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And the p beta is the
total final momentum.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.770 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.250 align:middle line:84%
So this part is
purely kinematic.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.290 align:middle line:84%
So the M alpha beta
is the physical part.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is normally called
the scattering amplitude.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:20.380 align:middle line:90%


00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.900 align:middle line:84%
So our goal is to be able
to calculate the scattering

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.290 align:middle line:90%
amplitude.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.550 align:middle line:84%
So this is something--
some version

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.050 align:middle line:84%
of the scattering
amplitude that can

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.650 align:middle line:90%
be measured in the experiments.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.310 align:middle line:84%
So theoretically, we want
to be able to calculate

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.700 align:middle line:90%
this quantity.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.320 align:middle line:84%
So they'll be able to
compare with the experiments.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.225 align:middle line:90%
So we also mentioned--

00:04:45.225 --> 00:04:47.240 align:middle line:84%
I will not repeat
here-- we also mentioned

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.330 align:middle line:84%
that this S alpha
beta, S beta alpha

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.770 align:middle line:84%
also have various
properties, which

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:02.310 align:middle line:84%
you should go back to your notes
of last class to review them.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.570 align:middle line:84%
So one of the key points
is the LSZ theorem,

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.620 align:middle line:84%
which said, which
I just mentioned,

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:24.360 align:middle line:84%
that M alpha beta can be
obtained from a correlation

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.950 align:middle line:90%
function, like this.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Say, for example,
for that theory, OK?

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.770 align:middle line:84%
So the n would correspond
to the total number

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.070 align:middle line:84%
of particles of the
initial plus final states.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.470 align:middle line:84%
So suppose you have
2 to 2 scattering,

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.260 align:middle line:90%
and then n would be equal to 4.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you start
from 2 particles,

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.450 align:middle line:84%
you scattering to 3
particles, then n will be 5.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.240 align:middle line:90%
OK, just the total number, yeah.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.360 align:middle line:84%
So later, we will discuss,
in more detail, how you

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.240 align:middle line:90%
obtain M alpha beta from here.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.850 align:middle line:84%
But here, at the moment,
it's enough for us

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.300 align:middle line:84%
to know that the
scattering amplitude can be

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.410 align:middle line:90%
extracted from this quantity.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.682 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sorry, I should--

00:06:10.682 --> 00:06:12.140 align:middle line:84%
So here, it should
be time ordered.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:19.700 align:middle line:90%


00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And so let me just
explain the notation here.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:84%
So the omega is the vacuum
of your interacting theory.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.870 align:middle line:90%
And then the T is time ordering.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:41.180 align:middle line:90%


00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.020 align:middle line:84%
It means that, whoever
with the larger time,

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.350 align:middle line:90%
it will appear earlier.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Whoever with a larger
time will appear earlier.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.780 align:middle line:90%
And so any questions on this?

00:06:53.780 --> 00:07:00.530 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.960 align:middle line:84%
So our goal would be to tell you
how to calculate this quantity.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.010 align:middle line:84%
So once you know how to
calculate this quantity,

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.010 align:middle line:84%
then we will be able to
calculate the scattering

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:09.700 align:middle line:90%
amplitude.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And then you will be able
to compare with experiments.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.680 align:middle line:90%
And good.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.940 align:middle line:84%
So in principle, we already know
how to calculate this quantity

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.550 align:middle line:90%
from what you learned in 8.06.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.170 align:middle line:84%
So for people who have taken
8.06, here, you learned.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so we mentioned last time,
this theory cannot be solved,

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:34.340 align:middle line:90%
exactly.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And the only way we
can treat this theory

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:42.140 align:middle line:84%
is to take lambda small and then
treat this as a perturbation,

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.910 align:middle line:84%
treat this as a
small perturbation,

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.640 align:middle line:84%
and then expand all
your physical quantities

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.080 align:middle line:90%
in power series of lambda.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.940 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.780 align:middle line:84%
So this procedure is
called perturbation theory.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And in your quantum
mechanics class,

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:03.140 align:middle line:84%
you should have already learned
how to do perturbation theory.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:07.790 align:middle line:84%
For example, in 8.06, that's
a big part of the 8.06 class.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so just with 8.06,
in principle, you already

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.410 align:middle line:90%
know how to do this.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.086 align:middle line:84%
Let me just outline
the procedure--

00:08:15.086 --> 00:08:22.350 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.440 align:middle line:90%
a computation.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.980 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.470 align:middle line:84%
So that is a
correlation function.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:35.045 align:middle line:84%
So it's called a time
ordered correlation function.

00:08:35.045 --> 00:08:51.190 align:middle line:90%


00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:55.880 align:middle line:84%
So what I will call this is
a naive perturbation theory.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.380 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
perturbation theory

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:03.530 align:middle line:84%
you would do after
you learned 8.06, OK,

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.147 align:middle line:84%
after you learned
8.06, and then you

00:09:05.147 --> 00:09:06.980 align:middle line:84%
will be able to do this
perturbation theory.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:12.350 align:middle line:90%


00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:16.640 align:middle line:84%
But we will do something
more clever, OK?

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.460 align:middle line:84%
We will do something
more clever.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.610 align:middle line:84%
But let me just
remind you, equipped

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.980 align:middle line:84%
with your previous quantum
mechanical knowledge,

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.890 align:middle line:84%
how would you
treat this problem?

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:34.030 align:middle line:84%
So now let's consider, again,
that theory as example.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:38.410 align:middle line:84%
So the equation of
motion gives you

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:44.290 align:middle line:84%
partial square, minus m square
phi equal to, say, lambda

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:45.580 align:middle line:90%
divided by 6 phi cubed.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.690 align:middle line:90%


00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And so we can solve this
equation even though we cannot

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.430 align:middle line:90%
solve this equation exactly.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.620 align:middle line:84%
We can solve it for
perturbatively in lambda.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:09.960 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.370 align:middle line:84%
So the way we do it
is the following.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:19.230 align:middle line:84%
We write phi equal to phi 0,
and the lambda phi 1 plus lambda

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.260 align:middle line:90%
squared phi 2, et cetera.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.030 align:middle line:90%
So lambda is a small number.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:29.460 align:middle line:84%
You imagine you expand phi
in power series of lambda.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And then you just plug
in this power series

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.210 align:middle line:84%
into this equation, and
then you equate two side

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.640 align:middle line:90%
with the same power of lambda.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.930 align:middle line:90%
With the same power of lambda?

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So the 0th order, you just
get our previous equation,

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:90%
phi 0 equal to 0.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:52.030 align:middle line:84%
So phi 0 is just like our
previous free field equation.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:55.360 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And then at 1st order,
then you see phi 1,

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:07.540 align:middle line:84%
and now you have 1 over 6
phi 0 to the cube, and then

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:08.050 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:11.880 align:middle line:90%


00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So this equation, we
know how to solve.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And once you know how
to solve this equation,

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.070 align:middle line:84%
you find a solution
for phi 0, then

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.810 align:middle line:90%
you plug it in this equation.

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And now this just becomes
a linear equation.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.290 align:middle line:90%
Now you can solve phi 1.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, you can
solve phi 2, et cetera.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So order by order, you
can solve all of them.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And all of them become
linear equations.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:40.230 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:50.670 align:middle line:84%
So phi 1 -- all higher orders
can be solved in terms of phi

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:51.750 align:middle line:90%
0.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:56.640 align:middle line:84%
So once you find the
phi 0, and then phi 0

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.200 align:middle line:90%
can be solved in terms of phi 0.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:05.650 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:09.290 align:middle line:84%
So classically, this
gives you a solution.

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And as we said, quantum
mechanically, we just

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.630 align:middle line:84%
treat this, treat all of
this as operator equations.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, essentially,
you can just

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:24.130 align:middle line:84%
solve the phi, perturbatively,
as the operator equation--

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.140 align:middle line:90%
as a quantum operator.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you solve this
quantum operator equation,

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.090 align:middle line:90%
perturbatively.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:45.840 align:middle line:90%


00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:58.270 align:middle line:84%
So similarly, we
can solve this omega

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.410 align:middle line:90%
using perturbation theory.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.050 align:middle line:90%
So first, we expand again.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.600 align:middle line:90%
We expand this omega in power.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is the vacuum of
the interacting theory.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:12.685 align:middle line:84%
And we expand it into
a perturbative series.

00:13:12.685 --> 00:13:26.230 align:middle line:90%


00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:31.610 align:middle line:84%
So the 0th order, you just
get the free theory vacuum.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And then you will have
corrections from the lambda,

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.780 align:middle line:84%
here, due to you
have interactions

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.360 align:middle line:84%
and because your
Hamiltonian change.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Because of the lambda,
your Hamiltonian change.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And so your ground
state will also change.

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And so, now, you
can use your 8.06

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:54.680 align:middle line:84%
to work out those higher
order corrections.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:14:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so now when you
worked out the phi,

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:03.940 align:middle line:84%
when you worked
out the omega, now,

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.140 align:middle line:90%
you can work out this object.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.580 align:middle line:90%
So let me just call this G n.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So the G n then can be reduced
to a calculation free theory.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:33.060 align:middle line:90%


00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And you need
perturbation theory,

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.340 align:middle line:84%
because everything can be
expressed in terms of phi 0.

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And here, again, you
expand in terms of phi 0.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And the corrections can
be obtained by, say, phi 0

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.550 align:middle line:84%
acting on a vacuum
state, et cetera.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:51.240 align:middle line:84%
So in the end, if you
do this procedure,

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.080 align:middle line:84%
then you should be able
to calculate this G n.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Conceptually, it's not very
difficult to calculate.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.850 align:middle line:84%
But this procedure is
actually very complicated.

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:08.590 align:middle line:90%


00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I don't urge you
to try it yourself.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.270 align:middle line:84%
But I think you
should try just to get

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:18.665 align:middle line:84%
the sense that this procedure
is actually not very easy to do.

00:15:18.665 --> 00:15:20.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, in
quantum field theory,

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:24.370 align:middle line:84%
we actually need to develop a
more sophisticated technique

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:25.810 align:middle line:90%
to treat this.

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what people
did in the early days.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:34.268 align:middle line:84%
In the early days, before
systematic perturbation

00:15:34.268 --> 00:15:36.310 align:middle line:84%
technique for quantum
field theory was developed,

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.470 align:middle line:84%
that's how people
did it in the past.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:41.590 align:middle line:90%


00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:42.790 align:middle line:90%
And that was not easy.

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.070 align:middle line:90%
But people did it.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.650 align:middle line:90%


00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.600 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
calculate, the 1st order,

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.590 align:middle line:90%
it's actually doable.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:middle line:84%
But the higher orders become
increasingly complicated.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:04.312 align:middle line:84%
And quickly becomes
very complicated

00:16:04.312 --> 00:16:05.520 align:middle line:90%
when you go to higher orders.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:21.910 align:middle line:90%


00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, people developed
something more clever.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:32.040 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, people developed
something more clever.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.240 align:middle line:90%
So there are two approaches.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:40.730 align:middle line:84%
There are two more
sophisticated approaches, which

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:44.490 align:middle line:90%
are, in the end, equivalent.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:48.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, in the end,
they're equivalent,

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.680 align:middle line:84%
but their derivation
is different.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.940 align:middle line:84%
So the first is you use
so-called interaction picture.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:05.430 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:08.359 align:middle line:84%
You use so-called
interaction picture.

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:10.682 align:middle line:84%
So what do you do
is the following.

00:17:10.682 --> 00:17:12.849 align:middle line:84%
So you separate your
Hamiltonian, total Hamiltonian,

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:15.970 align:middle line:84%
in terms of a free theory
Hamiltonian and the interacting

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.752 align:middle line:90%
part.

00:17:17.752 --> 00:17:19.210 align:middle line:84%
So the free theory
Hamiltonian just

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:30.500 align:middle line:84%
comes from, say, if I write
this as L0 minus that plus L I--

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:36.220 align:middle line:84%
so this term is L I,
so this part is L0.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And so similarly, you can
write your Hamiltonian-- also

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.140 align:middle line:84%
separate into the free theory
Hamiltonian and the interacting

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.910 align:middle line:90%
part.

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And then the
interacting picture--

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:53.440 align:middle line:84%
it introduces the state
into interacting picture,

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:58.090 align:middle line:84%
and you introduce the operator
in the interacting picture.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:00.760 align:middle line:84%
So the state, in the
interacting picture,

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:09.290 align:middle line:84%
are related by the standard
state in the Schrodinger

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:09.790 align:middle line:90%
picture.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:18.960 align:middle line:90%


00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.420 align:middle line:90%
So let me just put S here.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.150 align:middle line:84%
So this denotes the states
in the Schrodinger picture,

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.400 align:middle line:90%
through this factor of H0--

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.550 align:middle line:90%
basically, i H0 t.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And the operators in
the interacting picture

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:41.490 align:middle line:84%
are related to the operator
in the Schrodinger picture,

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:43.980 align:middle line:84%
also, through this factor
of the exponential of H0.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:51.323 align:middle line:90%


00:18:51.323 --> 00:18:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Already in your
quantum mechanics,

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.990 align:middle line:84%
you may have discussed
the interaction picture.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen the
interaction picture before?

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:57.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.200 align:middle line:84%
So remember this evolves
with the full Hamiltonian.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.600 align:middle line:84%
In the Schrodinger
picture, this evolves

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.460 align:middle line:90%
with the full Hamiltonian.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And so, here, the
interaction picture

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:16.680 align:middle line:84%
related this by evolution
operator-- conjugate

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.040 align:middle line:84%
of the evolution operator
for the free Hamiltonian.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So this Psi I is still
evolved in a complicated way.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So in the interacting
picture, the states still

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.810 align:middle line:90%
evolves in a complicated way.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.910 align:middle line:84%
But the operator
evolve very simply,

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:32.790 align:middle line:84%
because, in the
Schrodinger picture,

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:34.530 align:middle line:90%
the operator don't evolve.

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And here, the evolution
just controlled

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.900 align:middle line:90%
by the free Hamiltonian.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.210 align:middle line:84%
So in the interacting
picture, the states

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:45.750 align:middle line:84%
still evolve, complicatedly,
but the operator

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.790 align:middle line:90%
evolves in a simple way.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, with some manipulation,
by introducing this interacting

00:19:53.100 --> 00:20:00.420 align:middle line:84%
picture, you can design a
more clever way to do this,

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:90%
to do the perturbation theory.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I will not
go through it, here.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:15.690 align:middle line:84%
You should read the book, Peskin
and Schroeder, section 4.2.

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And there they give
a detailed discussion

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:25.530 align:middle line:84%
how you do perturbation theory
using this interacting picture.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:29.940 align:middle line:84%
So a second approach is
to use the path integral.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:37.620 align:middle line:90%


00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.600 align:middle line:90%
And just use path integral.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So path integrals,
in my own opinion,

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:48.790 align:middle line:84%
have lots of advantage over
this interaction picture.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.310 align:middle line:84%
So when you do
interaction picture,

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.200 align:middle line:84%
you get the feeling,
somehow, you're

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.720 align:middle line:90%
doing some very clever tricks.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know why you
want to do those tricks.

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:01.948 align:middle line:90%
And you get some nice formulas.

00:21:01.948 --> 00:21:03.990 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, you feel
you're doing a little bit--

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.870 align:middle line:90%


00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.300 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you're doing
some kind of magic.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.780 align:middle line:84%
But the path
integral treatment is

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:15.030 align:middle line:84%
automatic in the sense
it's straightforward.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.680 align:middle line:90%
And you don't have to think.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And it just follows
from the path integral.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's much easier
to generalize.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:23.160 align:middle line:90%
And it's physically intuitive.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why we will
describe this approach.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Because it's more
physically intuitive.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, when you do too
much fancy mathematics,

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:41.320 align:middle line:84%
you feel you obscure
the physical picture.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.672 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, this
interaction picture

00:21:44.672 --> 00:21:46.630 align:middle line:84%
gives you a little bit
of that kind of feeling.

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:50.620 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.810 align:middle line:84%
But it's important
for you to know it.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:54.700 align:middle line:84%
We don't have time
to cover both.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And so we choose just
to do this in class.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.908 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you have a question?

00:21:59.908 --> 00:22:01.450 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: In the
interaction picture,

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:03.740 align:middle line:84%
why do both state
and the operator

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.450 align:middle line:90%
evolve according to H sub 0?

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.108 align:middle line:84%
Shouldn't the state
evolve according

00:22:07.108 --> 00:22:08.400 align:middle line:90%
to the interaction Hamiltonian?

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.025 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:22:09.025 --> 00:22:11.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, just by design.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.450 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.550 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: I just
defined them this way.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:15.258 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:22:15.258 --> 00:22:16.883 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: I just
defined them this way.

00:22:16.883 --> 00:22:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Turns out the quantity
defined this way is actually

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:23.370 align:middle line:84%
convenient for doing
perturbation theory.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I say there's
a little bit of magic here.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And you have to introduce this
kind of unintuitive quantities,

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.360 align:middle line:84%
which turns out actually
to be quite simple when

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.020 align:middle line:90%
you do perturbation theory.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:35.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.470 align:middle line:90%


00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:41.010 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:42.230 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:45.170 align:middle line:90%


00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:48.778 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's just go plug
into the path integral.

00:22:48.778 --> 00:22:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And now let's just plug
into path integral.

00:22:50.570 --> 00:23:06.620 align:middle line:90%


00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.860 align:middle line:84%
So path integral is
an alternative way

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.350 align:middle line:90%
to formulate quantum mechanics.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:15.770 align:middle line:84%
It's equivalent, say, to
the Schrodinger equation

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.370 align:middle line:90%
or Heisenberg equation.

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:19.370 align:middle line:84%
It's equivalent to your
standard way of thinking

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:21.980 align:middle line:90%
about quantum mechanics.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:25.880 align:middle line:84%
So path integral will give
you a better conceptual way

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:29.510 align:middle line:84%
for non-relativistic
quantum mechanics.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Path integral, most
of the time, they

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:38.880 align:middle line:84%
give you a better
conceptual way to think

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.900 align:middle line:90%
about quantum mechanics.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:44.860 align:middle line:84%
But, in terms of
calculations, it often

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.200 align:middle line:90%
does not offer any advantage.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the textbooks,
for undergraduate quantum

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:55.372 align:middle line:84%
mechanics, they don't
just do path integral.

00:23:55.372 --> 00:23:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Because to do the calculation,
it's still much easier

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:58.830 align:middle line:90%
to solve Schrodinger equation.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:02.530 align:middle line:90%


00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:06.342 align:middle line:84%
But conceptually, it gives
you a better picture.

00:24:06.342 --> 00:24:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And for quantum field
theory, it actually

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:09.115 align:middle line:90%
become much more useful.

00:24:09.115 --> 00:24:13.103 align:middle line:90%


00:24:13.103 --> 00:24:14.395 align:middle line:90%
Is there any questions on this?

00:24:14.395 --> 00:24:17.640 align:middle line:90%


00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.140 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:18.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.690 align:middle line:90%


00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:26.970 align:middle line:84%
OK, so first, we are
going just to review

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:28.720 align:middle line:84%
the story for the
non-relativistic quantum

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.900 align:middle line:90%
mechanics.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And once we understand this and
the immediate generalization--

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:37.910 align:middle line:90%
the field theory is immediate.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Generalization to field
theory is immediate.

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:48.640 align:middle line:84%
So we will just use the example
of just one particle, just

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.100 align:middle line:84%
a particle in one
dimension, just

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:54.250 align:middle line:90%
with the most familiar one.

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:57.340 align:middle line:90%
So use this as an example.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Once we understand this
example, then you essentially

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:02.495 align:middle line:90%
understand everything.

00:25:02.495 --> 00:25:07.310 align:middle line:90%


00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:09.350 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.530 align:middle line:84%
So now the key point
about the path integral--

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:16.070 align:middle line:90%


00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.030 align:middle line:84%
previously, in
quantum mechanics,

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:21.530 align:middle line:84%
you start with the
Schrodinger equation.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.020 align:middle line:84%
But the path integral starts
with a different object.

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.630 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.420 align:middle line:84%
So the object which
the path integral

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.180 align:middle line:84%
is most convenient to
treat is the propagator

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.035 align:middle line:90%
we discussed before.

00:25:33.035 --> 00:25:38.580 align:middle line:90%


00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So this is the object which
we defined, in the Heisenberg

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.050 align:middle line:90%
picture, to be this object.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:50.930 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
transition amplitude.

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:53.040 align:middle line:90%
If you have a particle--

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.960 align:middle line:84%
if you have an eigenstate,
with x prime and t prime

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:01.730 align:middle line:84%
and go into a position
eigenstate at the location, x,

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:03.440 align:middle line:90%
at time t.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.803 align:middle line:84%
So we mentioned before,
if you load this object,

00:26:06.803 --> 00:26:07.970 align:middle line:90%
essentially it's equivalent.

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:09.890 align:middle line:84%
You have solved the
Schrodinger equation.

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Because from the wave
equation at t prime,

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:17.420 align:middle line:90%
then by integrated with this--

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.720 align:middle line:84%
convoluted with
this object, then

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.420 align:middle line:84%
you can get the wave
function at time t.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.980 align:middle line:90%


00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And so this can also be written
in terms of Schrodinger picture

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:36.530 align:middle line:90%
as this.

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Just start with the
position eigenstate

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:44.300 align:middle line:84%
at x prime, then you
evolve for t minus t prime,

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:49.685 align:middle line:84%
and then you ask the
overlap with the x.

00:26:49.685 --> 00:26:53.796 align:middle line:90%


00:26:53.796 --> 00:26:56.410 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:26:56.410 --> 00:27:00.460 align:middle line:90%
So let me call this object k.

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:06.490 align:middle line:84%
This is k x t, x
prime, t prime, OK?

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:10.730 align:middle line:84%
If you know the wave function,
so the wave function at t

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:16.277 align:middle line:84%
x can be written as a wave
function at the t x prime, k t

00:27:16.277 --> 00:27:20.350 align:middle line:90%
x, t prime, x prime.

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think I
changed the order.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.680 align:middle line:84%
So just to be consistent
with the order I wrote there.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.940 align:middle line:90%
t prime, psi, t prime, x prime.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you know the wave
function at t prime,

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:39.750 align:middle line:84%
and then, if I integrate this,
you know the wave function.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:44.690 align:middle line:84%
So knowing this object
is equivalent to solving

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:45.780 align:middle line:90%
the system.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:50.120 align:middle line:84%
So now we will describe a
way to compute this object.

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.270 align:middle line:84%
We will describe a way
to compute this object.

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:56.870 align:middle line:90%


00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:00.710 align:middle line:84%
So do you have any
questions on this?

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:01.210 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:03.850 align:middle line:90%


00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:09.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we will do
this by using a trick.

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:12.180 align:middle line:90%


00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:14.830 align:middle line:84%
So imagine this
is your time axis.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:17.020 align:middle line:90%
So we start with t prime.

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And then we end at t, So
this is the time axis.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:24.660 align:middle line:90%
End at t.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:28.590 align:middle line:84%
So what we will do is we
divide it into segments.

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Divide this interval by
infinite number of segments,

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.410 align:middle line:84%
and each segment is
infinitesimal, of course.

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:43.920 align:middle line:84%
So we label this point
by 0, 1, 2, etcetera.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:50.960 align:middle line:90%
So t0 would be just be t prime.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And the last point will be
n, and the tn would be t.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:01.910 align:middle line:84%
So we divided this
by n intervals.

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:05.030 align:middle line:90%


00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:07.920 align:middle line:84%
So the width of the
interval is delta t

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.840 align:middle line:84%
equal to t minus t
prime divided by n.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.202 align:middle line:90%
So here is delta t.

00:29:13.202 --> 00:29:16.320 align:middle line:90%


00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And if we take n go to
infinity, and then this integral

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.700 align:middle line:90%
goes to 0.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:27.880 align:middle line:90%


00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:32.060 align:middle line:84%
So the reason for
considering this?

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:34.400 align:middle line:84%
Just now, we can
rewrite the expression,

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:49.130 align:middle line:84%
minus i H t prime in
terms of many i H delta t,

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:50.165 align:middle line:90%
and then n times.

00:29:50.165 --> 00:29:52.523 align:middle line:90%


00:29:52.523 --> 00:29:53.690 align:middle line:90%
Essentially, I have n times.

00:29:53.690 --> 00:30:00.510 align:middle line:90%


00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:01.875 align:middle line:90%
So now what I'm going to do?

00:30:01.875 --> 00:30:05.190 align:middle line:90%


00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Then we have this x, say,
exponential minus i H delta t.

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:16.470 align:middle line:84%
So now let's write this
n times, separately--

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:20.340 align:middle line:90%


00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:20.865 align:middle line:90%
x prime.

00:30:20.865 --> 00:30:24.120 align:middle line:90%


00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.207 align:middle line:90%
So now let's insert.

00:30:27.207 --> 00:30:29.290 align:middle line:84%
So the mathematical tool
that we are going to use?

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Insert, between
each such factor,

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:38.010 align:middle line:84%
a complete set of
states, a complete set

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:39.930 align:middle line:90%
of position eigenstates.

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:49.140 align:middle line:90%
So we insert at t i.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Yeah because here, it's
t0, then going to here

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:56.970 align:middle line:90%
will be t1, et cetera.

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:01.940 align:middle line:84%
So at t i, you insert a
complete set of eigenstate.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:06.420 align:middle line:90%


00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:11.750 align:middle line:84%
You just insert one
position eigenstate.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:15.900 align:middle line:90%


00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:27.780 align:middle line:84%
So now this object, k, then
can be written as then d x 1,

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.430 align:middle line:90%
d x n minus 1.

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:32.490 align:middle line:90%
So at each here, you--

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:33.360 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And then you have x exponential
minus i H delta t x n minus 1.

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:47.980 align:middle line:90%


00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And then all the way,
here, into x1 exponential

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:56.080 align:middle line:90%
minus i H delta t, x prime.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:01.670 align:middle line:90%


00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:06.560 align:middle line:84%
So the purpose for
doing so is that now we

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:12.230 align:middle line:84%
can calculate each of
such things, explicitly.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.910 align:middle line:90%
And now we will see.

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:17.925 align:middle line:84%
So now let's consider
just one of such factor.

00:32:17.925 --> 00:32:23.350 align:middle line:90%


00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:30.180 align:middle line:84%
So factor, here, have the form
x i plus 1 exponential minus i

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.390 align:middle line:90%
h delta t x i.

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:38.040 align:middle line:84%
So any factor, here, have
the form for some value of i.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.830 align:middle line:90%


00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So i start from 0 all
the way to n minus 1.

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:47.710 align:middle line:90%


00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:51.520 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's compute
this quantity.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.740 align:middle line:90%


00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And now this quantity
is actually computable,

00:32:56.650 --> 00:33:02.350 align:middle line:84%
even though this object
is very hard to compute,

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:06.710 align:middle line:84%
even though this object
is very hard to compute.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:08.320 align:middle line:84%
This object is very
hard to compute.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Because you have the
potential there, et cetera.

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:16.160 align:middle line:84%
In general, we don't know how
to compute this exponential.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.560 align:middle line:84%
But now the trick is that,
once you separate them

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.890 align:middle line:84%
into infinitesimal steps,
then we can actually calculate

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:23.903 align:middle line:90%
the infinitesimal step.

00:33:23.903 --> 00:33:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And once you can calculate
infinitesimal step,

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:29.630 align:middle line:84%
you just add them together,
then become the whole thing.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:30.785 align:middle line:90%
So that's the basic idea.

00:33:30.785 --> 00:33:33.490 align:middle line:90%


00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:35.755 align:middle line:84%
So to do this
contain two elements.

00:33:35.755 --> 00:33:43.120 align:middle line:90%


00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.940 align:middle line:84%
So the first element
is to recognize--

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:50.660 align:middle line:84%
now, remember, h,
here, is the operator.

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.820 align:middle line:84%
So let me just to
emphasize here,

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.160 align:middle line:84%
now, let me put a hat,
here, just to emphasize here

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.810 align:middle line:90%
is the operator.

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And so if you write
this explicitly,

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:07.030 align:middle line:90%
this is minus i delta t.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And then you have p
squared divided by 2m.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:15.020 align:middle line:90%
Let me just also put the--

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.680 align:middle line:84%
yeah, to emphasize the
operators, and the V hat.

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:25.320 align:middle line:90%


00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:29.475 align:middle line:84%
So now, because the
delta t is small,

00:34:29.475 --> 00:34:34.880 align:middle line:84%
it goes to 0, then to
leading order in delta t,

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.739 align:middle line:90%
so this is the first element.

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:38.000 align:middle line:90%
The first element is a point.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Then to leading
order in delta t,

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:43.550 align:middle line:84%
we can actually just
separate the exponential.

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:48.409 align:middle line:84%
You can say this is
approximately equal

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:57.350 align:middle line:84%
to exponential i delta t, p
hat squared divided by 2m,

00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and the exponential
i delta t, V hat x.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And the only corrections
are order delta t squared.

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:12.940 align:middle line:90%


00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:19.160 align:middle line:84%
So this, you can easily see
from the Campbell House--

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:23.050 align:middle line:90%
Campbell or Baker?

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:26.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, anyway BCH formula.

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:29.590 align:middle line:90%
So from the BCH formula--

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:31.330 align:middle line:90%
let me write it here.

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:37.975 align:middle line:84%
Exponential A plus B is equal
to exponential A exponential B.

00:35:37.975 --> 00:35:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And then exponential minus
1/2 A commutator B, then

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.000 align:middle line:90%
plus with more commutators.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.472 align:middle line:84%
And now each A and B are
proportional to delta t.

00:35:52.472 --> 00:35:54.680 align:middle line:84%
So here is proportional to
delta t, here proportional

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:55.220 align:middle line:90%
to delta t.

00:35:55.220 --> 00:36:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And here, it involves at
least the product of A and B.

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:04.640 align:middle line:84%
So here, it's all higher
order in delta t squared.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:08.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the key
reason we want to do this.

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:12.050 align:middle line:84%
We want to separate
into individual steps.

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:13.820 align:middle line:90%
Because we can factorize them.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Because, in general, we
cannot factorize this guy.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:20.180 align:middle line:84%
This guy is very complicated,
because p and x don't commute.

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.770 align:middle line:84%
In general, we cannot
factorize them.

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:22.760 align:middle line:90%
It's very complicated.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.550 align:middle line:84%
For a finite t, here, we
cannot factorize them.

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.590 align:middle line:84%
But for delta t, we
can factorize them.

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:30.140 align:middle line:90%
We get this structure.

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:32.740 align:middle line:84%
So once you have this
structure, and then this thing

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:33.740 align:middle line:90%
becomes easy to compute.

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:37.930 align:middle line:90%


00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:39.285 align:middle line:90%
The second thing you can show.

00:36:39.285 --> 00:37:12.780 align:middle line:90%


00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.340 align:middle line:84%
So the second
thing you can show?

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can show
that x i plus 1--

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:22.740 align:middle line:84%
so now you plug in
this factorized form

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:26.340 align:middle line:90%
into this expression.

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:29.890 align:middle line:90%
And now you can compute this.

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:36.510 align:middle line:84%
So you have minus i delta t,
p hat squared divided by 2m,

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:42.600 align:middle line:84%
minus i delta t,
V x hat and x i.

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.410 align:middle line:90%
So those are just eigenvalues.

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:45.300 align:middle line:90%
So there's no hat.

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:46.440 align:middle line:90%
But here, there's a hat.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.860 align:middle line:90%
They are operators.

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:53.430 align:middle line:84%
So here, you can now
compute this object.

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:56.550 align:middle line:84%
So this becomes an elementary
exercise in quantum mechanics.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:59.060 align:middle line:90%


00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:01.040 align:middle line:90%
I will not.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:04.400 align:middle line:84%
There's like two line
calculation here.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.250 align:middle line:84%
I will leave it
to your homework,

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:10.250 align:middle line:84%
so you can calculate
this object.

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Let me just write
down the result.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:16.430 align:middle line:84%
So this becomes the
following object--

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:22.250 align:middle line:84%
m divided by 2pi i
delta t exponential--

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:25.940 align:middle line:84%
so you can evaluate
this thing, explicitly--

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:39.650 align:middle line:84%
1/2 i m, x i plus 1 minus x
i delta t squared delta t,

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:45.020 align:middle line:90%
minus i delta t V x.

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:45.965 align:middle line:90%
So you just get this.

00:38:45.965 --> 00:38:48.480 align:middle line:90%


00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.170 align:middle line:90%
So this is the answer.

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:53.520 align:middle line:90%
So this is the second element.

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Now this is readily computable
using the standard technique.

00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:02.610 align:middle line:84%
So I will remember to
put it in your homework.

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:10.190 align:middle line:90%


00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:16.840 align:middle line:84%
So now we have to use a
little bit of imagination.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:21.420 align:middle line:84%
So now we have to imagine-- use
a little bit of imagination.

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:24.395 align:middle line:84%
I should have drawn this
line longer or bigger.

00:39:24.395 --> 00:39:26.145 align:middle line:84%
Let me just draw this
a little bit bigger.

00:39:26.145 --> 00:39:29.580 align:middle line:90%


00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:31.995 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, I drew this
line too short.

00:39:31.995 --> 00:39:34.680 align:middle line:90%


00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:38.560 align:middle line:90%
So let me just draw this longer.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.840 align:middle line:90%
So here is t prime.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.910 align:middle line:90%
Here is t.

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Here, you have
different locations.

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:50.890 align:middle line:84%
So I also draw the
delta t to be big.

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:54.210 align:middle line:90%
So at each t i, you have x i.

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:56.760 align:middle line:90%
We insert an x i, OK?

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.290 align:middle line:90%
So this is t i.

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:00.750 align:middle line:90%
We insert an x i.

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So at t1, we insert
x1, et cetera.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:09.420 align:middle line:84%
So now you imagine,
for each choice,

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.300 align:middle line:84%
for each value of
x, in the end, we

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.130 align:middle line:84%
need to integrate
over all possible x.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:17.100 align:middle line:90%


00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:23.940 align:middle line:84%
So for each particular
value of x1, x2, x3, x n,

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:31.175 align:middle line:84%
we can view it as a function
of t evaluated at that point.

00:40:31.175 --> 00:40:35.230 align:middle line:90%


00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:43.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's consider, you
have a function, x t,

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:49.495 align:middle line:84%
so that when you evaluate it at
t i, the value is x i plus x i.

00:40:49.495 --> 00:40:55.190 align:middle line:90%


00:40:55.190 --> 00:41:02.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you think this way, now
this thing in the exponential

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:06.660 align:middle line:84%
will become a very
familiar object.

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:10.020 align:middle line:90%
So what is this object?

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.930 align:middle line:90%
A Lagrangian?

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, just become
the Lagrangian.

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Because this is just
like the time derivative,

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:19.550 align:middle line:84%
so this is just
like x dot square.

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is just
like V times delta t.

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:26.700 align:middle line:90%


00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:27.975 align:middle line:90%
So this is equal to--

00:41:27.975 --> 00:41:30.800 align:middle line:90%


00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:33.130 align:middle line:90%
so go from here to here.

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:35.470 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is just equal to--

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:47.920 align:middle line:84%
with the same prefactor, just
become exponential i delta t

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:51.410 align:middle line:90%
times your Lagrangian density.

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:53.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, just a Lagrangian, here.

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Just the Lagrangian x,
x dot evaluated at t i.

00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:02.120 align:middle line:90%


00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.740 align:middle line:90%
So you have the Lagrangian.

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:09.750 align:middle line:84%
So remember, the
Lagrangian is just 1/2

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:11.840 align:middle line:90%
m x dot squared minus V x.

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:15.960 align:middle line:90%


00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So if you take all this delta
t factor and this i factor,

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:23.460 align:middle line:84%
and then this just becomes
1/2 m x dot square.

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And this just becomes
V all evaluated at x i.

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:29.070 align:middle line:90%
And x i is the value at t i.

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:32.630 align:middle line:90%
So all evaluated at t i.

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So now you recognize, you just
get your Lagrangian there.

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:39.660 align:middle line:90%


00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:48.200 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can write
down the full t, full K.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:57.250 align:middle line:84%
So now the full K become
limit n go to infinity,

00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:59.940 align:middle line:90%
because we take delta t go to 0.

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So we need to take
the n go to infinity.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:10.540 align:middle line:84%
So m 2 pi i delta t to
the power m divided by 2.

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:13.570 align:middle line:84%
So each one gives
you square root.

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
d x1, d xn minus 1.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:28.010 align:middle line:84%
But now the integrand
becomes i delta t.

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Now you just sum over i
from 0 to n minus 1, L,

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:40.760 align:middle line:84%
your Lagrangian, x, x
prime evaluated at t i.

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:43.310 align:middle line:90%


00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Because now, the product
in the exponential

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:47.330 align:middle line:90%
just become the sum.

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:53.440 align:middle line:90%


00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:57.800 align:middle line:84%
So now you recognize
this essentially

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:05.240 align:middle line:84%
is the discrete version of
the integral of L with dt.

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.270 align:middle line:90%
It's just over time.

00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:09.305 align:middle line:90%
So now we can write.

00:44:09.305 --> 00:44:11.970 align:middle line:90%


00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:14.400 align:middle line:84%
So the exponential,
we can essentially--

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.120 align:middle line:84%
so let me keep
this integral here.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.540 align:middle line:84%
So the exponential
part, we can write it

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:27.760 align:middle line:84%
as exponential times
i from t prime to t,

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:32.890 align:middle line:84%
say dt double
prime, L, x, x dot.

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:34.840 align:middle line:90%
So this just becomes that.

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:38.360 align:middle line:84%
The integrand just
becomes like that.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:42.520 align:middle line:84%
But we still have this whole
bunch of complicated stuff.

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Take n go to
infinity-- this thing.

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:49.150 align:middle line:90%


00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So normally, when you have
something complicated,

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:58.310 align:middle line:84%
again, there's an unfailing
trick in physics to do it.

00:44:58.310 --> 00:44:59.420 align:middle line:90%
What is that trick?

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:00.520 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:03.950 align:middle line:90%


00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:05.090 align:middle line:90%
Give it a name?

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, we just rename
it into something simple.

00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:11.750 align:middle line:84%
So we just call the
whole thing D X(t).

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:14.630 align:middle line:90%


00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:16.610 align:middle line:84%
This is just supposed
to represent this limit.

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:19.460 align:middle line:90%


00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:22.505 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
condition that x

00:45:22.505 --> 00:45:28.410 align:middle line:84%
t prime equal to x prime,
and x t equal to t--

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:32.000 align:middle line:90%
or x t equal to x.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And the meaning of
this D X(t), if you

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:48.460 align:middle line:84%
think about it, as I mentioned,
each particular choice of x1

00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:55.710 align:middle line:84%
and to x n minus 1, you
can think of some function

00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:59.490 align:middle line:90%
of x evaluated at t i.

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:02.505 align:middle line:84%
So now, you integrate over
all possible such values.

00:46:02.505 --> 00:46:05.280 align:middle line:90%


00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.860 align:middle line:84%
You integrate over all
possible such functions.

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.260 align:middle line:90%


00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:18.990 align:middle line:84%
So this just
corresponding to integrate

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:32.420 align:middle line:84%
all possible functions
x t satisfying--

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:35.980 align:middle line:84%
so mathematically,
this means satisfying

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:41.390 align:middle line:84%
that the x t prime equal to
x prime, and x t equal to x.

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:46.210 align:middle line:84%
So because we always
fix the two end points.

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:48.005 align:middle line:84%
You only integrate
in the middle.

00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:49.255 align:middle line:90%
You only integrate the middle.

00:46:49.255 --> 00:46:51.980 align:middle line:90%


00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So now this has a very simple
physical interpretation.

00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:01.070 align:middle line:90%


00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:03.730 align:middle line:84%
So now this has a very simple
physical interpretation.

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:18.140 align:middle line:90%


00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So integrate over all
possible functions x,

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:25.585 align:middle line:84%
between t and t prime,
with the end point fixed.

00:47:25.585 --> 00:47:28.150 align:middle line:90%


00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Physically, this
just means, suppose--

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:35.920 align:middle line:90%


00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.210 align:middle line:90%
so this is the t.

00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:39.730 align:middle line:90%
This is the x-axis.

00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:43.630 align:middle line:84%
So suppose that the
t prime is here.

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:50.140 align:middle line:84%
So here is the, say,
x prime at t prime.

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:54.070 align:middle line:90%
And so this is the x t.

00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:57.820 align:middle line:90%
So this is the x prime, t prime.

00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.700 align:middle line:90%
And this point is x and t.

00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:03.610 align:middle line:84%
So you integrate all possible
functions between them just

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:05.650 align:middle line:90%
corresponding to--

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:09.070 align:middle line:84%
you integrate over all
paths between them.

00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:14.220 align:middle line:90%


00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:16.470 align:middle line:84%
You integrate over all
possible paths between them.

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:21.150 align:middle line:90%


00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:35.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is the same as integrate
all paths between them.

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.055 align:middle line:90%
And the thing is weighted.

00:48:37.055 --> 00:48:39.950 align:middle line:90%


00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And each path is weighted
with the integrand.

00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:52.160 align:middle line:90%


00:48:52.160 --> 00:49:02.130 align:middle line:84%
It's weighted by
exponential i S.

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:04.680 align:middle line:90%
And the S is just your action.

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:08.570 align:middle line:90%


00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:14.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is, again,
from t prime to t.

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:20.512 align:middle line:90%


00:49:20.512 --> 00:49:21.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let me just write down.

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:25.110 align:middle line:90%


00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:26.295 align:middle line:90%
By this factor, OK?

00:49:26.295 --> 00:49:29.250 align:middle line:90%


00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:31.560 align:middle line:84%
So the so the integration,
with the Lagrangian,

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:34.020 align:middle line:90%
is just your action.

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you find
that, now, you can

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:43.010 align:middle line:84%
write this propagate this
transition amplitude in terms

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:44.850 align:middle line:84%
of the expression
corresponding to integrate

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:48.630 align:middle line:84%
all possible paths, sum
over all possible paths,

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:52.020 align:middle line:84%
and with the weight by the
action, exponential action.

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:56.440 align:middle line:90%


00:49:56.440 --> 00:50:03.640 align:middle line:84%
So this started as
a technical trick,

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:07.150 align:middle line:84%
because computing this
thing is complicated.

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And then we can make
mathematical progress

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:14.830 align:middle line:84%
by dividing them
into small intervals.

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:17.020 align:middle line:90%
But once you do that--

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:19.720 align:middle line:84%
but now we obtain
a different way.

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:24.220 align:middle line:84%
But now, we actually obtain
something conceptually new.

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:26.640 align:middle line:84%
You just say that
quantum mechanics.

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:32.400 align:middle line:84%
So classically,
remember, there is

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:35.610 align:middle line:84%
a fixed path from
x t prime to t,

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:37.590 align:middle line:84%
just follow the
equation of motion.

00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:39.690 align:middle line:84%
But now we say quantum
mechanically, we just

00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:41.460 align:middle line:90%
sum over all possible paths.

00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's the quantum
uncertainty compared

00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:46.710 align:middle line:90%
with the classical mechanics.

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:48.870 align:middle line:84%
So starting with that
mathematical trick,

00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:52.170 align:middle line:84%
but now we actually obtain
something conceptually brand

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:53.240 align:middle line:90%
new.

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because quantum
mechanically, the difference

00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:57.740 align:middle line:84%
from classical
mechanics, just now

00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:00.282 align:middle line:84%
we just sum over all
possible paths, which

00:51:00.282 --> 00:51:01.490 align:middle line:90%
is physically very intuitive.

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Because quantum mechanically,
you can just go anywhere--

00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:05.840 align:middle line:90%
OK, this uncertainty principle.

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:10.240 align:middle line:90%


00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:10.740 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:13.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Are there constraints on
what path is really possible?

00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Does it have to
be differentiable?

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.697 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, this is a good question.

00:51:20.697 --> 00:51:23.410 align:middle line:90%


00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:29.960 align:middle line:84%
So to make sense, rigorously,
this quantity is actually--

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:34.770 align:middle line:84%
yeah, to make rigorous, this
quantity is not easy to do.

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:36.650 align:middle line:90%
So we will not go into there.

00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:40.220 align:middle line:84%
That needs to go into
lots of mathematics.

00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:42.230 align:middle line:84%
So normally, we
don't need to worry

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:46.220 align:middle line:84%
about the precise mathematics,
how to define that path.

00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:48.800 align:middle line:90%


00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Mostly, we think this from
the conceptual picture.

00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And also, when we do technical
manipulations, as we will see,

00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:00.530 align:middle line:84%
often, you don't need to
know the details, how you

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:02.210 align:middle line:90%
define this measure, precisely.

00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:02.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:06.590 align:middle line:90%
Sir, a question.

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:08.330 align:middle line:90%
There's no coming back in time.

00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:10.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's right?

00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:13.940 align:middle line:90%
In principle.

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's no coming back in
time, just from here to there.

00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:18.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:19.940 align:middle line:90%
There's no coming back in time.

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:24.670 align:middle line:84%
But the path can wind
around as you want.

00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but time, you
cannot come back.

00:52:29.170 --> 00:52:32.110 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:34.260 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:39.450 align:middle line:84%
So there's also another
form of this path integral.

00:52:39.450 --> 00:52:40.850 align:middle line:90%
So I will not do it here.

00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:44.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a slight variance of this.

00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:46.040 align:middle line:90%
Let me just write it down.

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Again, I can put it
in your homework.

00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:54.950 align:middle line:84%
So there's also a Hamiltonian
form, which is much less used.

00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:57.380 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes this
is also useful.

00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:00.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a Hamiltonian form.

00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:06.230 align:middle line:84%
So you can also write the k,
same object as the following,

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:08.300 align:middle line:90%
as x.

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:09.935 align:middle line:84%
Again, the same
boundary condition, x

00:53:09.935 --> 00:53:13.610 align:middle line:84%
t prime equal to
x prime and x t.

00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:17.570 align:middle line:84%
So you integrate over all
possible paths, as here.

00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:23.620 align:middle line:84%
But you also integrate
over all possible momentum,

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:25.240 align:middle line:90%
within this time range.

00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And then the integrand
becomes the Hamiltonian.

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:33.830 align:middle line:84%
You write it in terms
of the Hamiltonian.

00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:43.430 align:middle line:84%
So t prime, t dt double
prime, then p x dot minus H.

00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:46.190 align:middle line:90%
So H is your Hamiltonian.

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And the p, now, is just some
function, some arbitrary

00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:49.800 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And so for any
choice of x and t p,

00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:57.620 align:middle line:90%
you can evaluate this quantity.

00:53:57.620 --> 00:53:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And then you sum all
of them together.

00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And so this alternative
form, which can be easily--

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:08.660 align:middle line:84%
again, a couple of
lines, which you can

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:10.160 align:middle line:84%
show to be equivalent
to this form.

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:17.240 align:middle line:90%


00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:20.150 align:middle line:84%
To show this is related
to the second step,

00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:23.180 align:middle line:84%
here, the intermediate
step of doing this one

00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:24.440 align:middle line:90%
will lead to this one.

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:33.425 align:middle line:90%


00:54:33.425 --> 00:54:33.925 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:54:33.925 --> 00:54:36.600 align:middle line:90%


00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:47.160 align:middle line:90%


00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:51.135 align:middle line:84%
So now let me just
talk about the example.

00:54:51.135 --> 00:54:58.700 align:middle line:90%


00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So how you can use this
method to calculate, say,

00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:06.875 align:middle line:90%
some systems, simple systems?

00:55:06.875 --> 00:55:11.000 align:middle line:90%


00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.160 align:middle line:84%
So as I said, this
method is not very

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:16.740 align:middle line:84%
efficient for non relativistic
quantum mechanics--

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:22.340 align:middle line:84%
and so even of a different
conceptual picture.

00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
from those examples.

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:27.990 align:middle line:84%
So now let's consider
a simple case.

00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So we just consider
a free particle.

00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:35.870 align:middle line:84%
So there's no V. So just
consider a free particle.

00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:43.530 align:middle line:90%


00:55:43.530 --> 00:55:47.640 align:middle line:84%
So here, S just
1/2 m x dot square.

00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:52.960 align:middle line:90%


00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Let me just use q,
since my notes use q.

00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:57.910 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:55:57.910 --> 00:56:03.475 align:middle line:84%
So let's try to compute, in
this theory, the amplitude.

00:56:03.475 --> 00:56:04.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's call Z t.

00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:06.990 align:middle line:90%


00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Say at time 0, you
are at q equal to 0.

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And then at time t, again,
you add q equal to 0.

00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:21.610 align:middle line:84%
So you just come back
to the same point.

00:56:21.610 --> 00:56:23.090 align:middle line:90%
Come back to the same point.

00:56:23.090 --> 00:56:26.080 align:middle line:84%
So corresponding
to this situation,

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:29.260 align:middle line:84%
if you call this direction
to be t and this direction

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:35.620 align:middle line:84%
to be q, so, at some
initial point, you are here.

00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And your final point, at
some t, the value of t,

00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:41.230 align:middle line:84%
again, you go back to
the same point in q.

00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And then we just sum
over all paths here--

00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:48.490 align:middle line:90%


00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:49.330 align:middle line:90%
but free particle.

00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:53.820 align:middle line:90%


00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So in order to compute this guy,
now, we have to work with this.

00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Because this is only
a formal notation.

00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Remember, this is a formal
notation for this object.

00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:06.340 align:middle line:84%
OK, if you really
want to compute this--

00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:08.370 align:middle line:84%
So this is called
the path integral.

00:57:08.370 --> 00:57:09.870 align:middle line:84%
So this is called
the path integral.

00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:12.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to really
calculate this path integral,

00:57:12.690 --> 00:57:16.690 align:middle line:84%
explicitly, then you have
to go back to this form.

00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:20.220 align:middle line:84%
You have to go
back to this form.

00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:24.240 align:middle line:90%
So the z t is equal to--

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:27.210 align:middle line:84%
in this case, limit
n go to infinity.

00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:33.180 align:middle line:90%


00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:35.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let me just not copy.

00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:40.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, anyway, you
can write down.

00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:42.090 align:middle line:90%
You just copy this down.

00:57:42.090 --> 00:57:45.750 align:middle line:90%
Just change this.

00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Just to save time,
change this x i to q.

00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And now the integrand, you
only have 1/2 m q squared.

00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:56.550 align:middle line:90%
There's no return.

00:57:56.550 --> 00:58:00.340 align:middle line:84%
You can just plug
that in, into here.

00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So now, in principle, you
can calculate that integral.

00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And I will leave
it to your exercise

00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:06.960 align:middle line:90%
to do in your homework.

00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And you find that it will
recover the standard answer.

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:12.780 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of the day,
when you do this integral,

00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:15.690 align:middle line:84%
this mini-integral, then you
find that this gives you--

00:58:15.690 --> 00:58:21.510 align:middle line:90%


00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:24.990 align:middle line:84%
actually, I didn't write
down the final answer.

00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:25.545 align:middle line:90%
Let me see.

00:58:25.545 --> 00:58:31.280 align:middle line:90%


00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So you find the final
answer is a very simple one,

00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:39.770 align:middle line:90%
just 2 pi i t square root.

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:44.960 align:middle line:84%
So you can do this, an
infinite number of integrals,

00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:47.010 align:middle line:90%
and then you get that answer.

00:58:47.010 --> 00:58:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you can calculate
that thing, easily,

00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:52.610 align:middle line:84%
by solving the
Schrodinger equation

00:58:52.610 --> 00:58:54.690 align:middle line:90%
using your standard method.

00:58:54.690 --> 00:58:57.050 align:middle line:84%
But this is a good
exercise to do.

00:58:57.050 --> 00:59:02.420 align:middle line:90%


00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:05.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is one method
to calculate it.

00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:07.700 align:middle line:84%
But this method is
not very efficient.

00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Because each time, if we
have to go through this

00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:11.870 align:middle line:84%
limit, and it will
be very annoying.

00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:14.960 align:middle line:90%


00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:18.980 align:middle line:84%
So now there's a
more abstract method.

00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a more abstract
method but much less

00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:25.310 align:middle line:90%
mathematically rigorous.

00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:27.080 align:middle line:84%
You can make it
mathematically rigorous,

00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:30.830 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not going to make
it mathematically rigorous.

00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:36.233 align:middle line:84%
But when you get used to it,
it's much easier to manipulate.

00:59:36.233 --> 00:59:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going to talk
about a second method

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:40.470 align:middle line:90%
to calculate this.

00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:41.945 align:middle line:90%
So this is the first method.

00:59:41.945 --> 00:59:46.740 align:middle line:90%


00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:48.435 align:middle line:90%
You just do honest integral.

00:59:48.435 --> 00:59:51.670 align:middle line:90%


00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:52.785 align:middle line:90%
So the second method?

00:59:52.785 --> 01:00:01.354 align:middle line:90%


01:00:01.354 --> 01:00:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Let me call this one
for the first method.

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:06.340 align:middle line:90%
And the second method--

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:35.140 align:middle line:90%


01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So in the second method,
let's first look at this.

01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, sorry, this should
be integrated over dt.

01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:44.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is a m and q's
creates the Lagrangian.

01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Here, we're talking
about the action.

01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So here we look at the action
which you appear in the path

01:00:49.050 --> 01:00:52.080 align:middle line:84%
integral in that
formal form then

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:56.340 align:middle line:84%
you have s is equal
to 1/2 m, then

01:00:56.340 --> 01:01:00.240 align:middle line:84%
you have dt from t
equal to 0 to capital T.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:03.390 align:middle line:84%
From t equal to 0 to
capital T. And then we

01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:06.030 align:middle line:90%
have 1/2 m q dot square.

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:11.510 align:middle line:90%


01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:13.890 align:middle line:90%
So we have that.

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going to slightly
rewrite this expression.

01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:24.320 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to write as
following, m, from 0 to T, dt--

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.910 align:middle line:90%
I will do integration by parts.

01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:30.070 align:middle line:90%


01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:30.900 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sorry.

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:32.490 align:middle line:90%
So I'm already out.

01:01:32.490 --> 01:01:36.300 align:middle line:84%
Then I have q minus
delta t squared, q.

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:39.170 align:middle line:90%


01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:41.520 align:middle line:84%
So integration by parts,
so the derivative will only

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.750 align:middle line:90%
act on one of the q.

01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:44.580 align:middle line:90%
So I get a minus sign.

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And the boundary term is all 0,
because the q, at the initial

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:50.522 align:middle line:90%
and the final value, are 0.

01:01:50.522 --> 01:01:51.855 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so you can check yourself.

01:01:51.855 --> 01:01:56.830 align:middle line:90%


01:01:56.830 --> 01:01:58.930 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to write this
expression a little bit

01:01:58.930 --> 01:01:59.430 align:middle line:90%
further.

01:01:59.430 --> 01:02:04.160 align:middle line:90%


01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:10.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to introduce
two t, t and t prime.

01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:13.370 align:middle line:90%
I write it as q.

01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let me, now,
just write it as 1/2.

01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:19.025 align:middle line:90%
Let me just write it as 1/2 q t.

01:02:19.025 --> 01:02:21.680 align:middle line:90%


01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And I write here minus m delta
t minus t prime, partial t

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.520 align:middle line:90%
prime squared, q t prime.

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:39.520 align:middle line:90%


01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:42.410 align:middle line:90%
So these two are the same.

01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:45.280 align:middle line:84%
So I introduce
additional t prime,

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.360 align:middle line:84%
but, also, I introduce
a delta function.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:50.380 align:middle line:84%
So when you evaluate that delta
function with t prime integral,

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:53.470 align:middle line:84%
you just get back to
the expression above.

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:57.220 align:middle line:90%


01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:59.355 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going to
pull this into the k.

01:02:59.355 --> 01:03:06.460 align:middle line:90%


01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, actually, sorry, I want
to put this minus sign out, just

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:11.590 align:middle line:90%
for convenience.

01:03:11.590 --> 01:03:13.540 align:middle line:90%
So let me just call this in k.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.543 align:middle line:90%
So what I get is the minus.

01:03:15.543 --> 01:03:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it doesn't
matter, actually.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.160 align:middle line:90%
So sorry.

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.370 align:middle line:90%
Let me put it here.

01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:22.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

01:03:22.270 --> 01:03:32.310 align:middle line:84%
So here, we can just write
1/2 dt dt prime, q t, k, t,

01:03:32.310 --> 01:03:34.555 align:middle line:90%
t prime, q t prime.

01:03:34.555 --> 01:03:42.507 align:middle line:90%


01:03:42.507 --> 01:03:43.340 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE] Question.

01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:45.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:48.470 align:middle line:84%
[AUDIENCE] What's the
integral of dt prime?

01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:49.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:50.750 align:middle line:84%
The integral of dt
prime, you can just

01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:53.960 align:middle line:84%
evaluate using this delta
function and then this go away.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And then this here,
this all become t,

01:03:56.090 --> 01:03:57.533 align:middle line:90%
then you just reduce to that.

01:03:57.533 --> 01:03:59.450 align:middle line:84%
[AUDIENCE] So is it like
an all time integral?

01:03:59.450 --> 01:03:59.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:00.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.070 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

01:04:01.070 --> 01:04:04.220 align:middle line:90%
It's the same from 0 to T. Yeah.

01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:04.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:05.870 align:middle line:90%
The same range.

01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:08.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:09.850 align:middle line:84%
So now I just call
this into the k.

01:04:09.850 --> 01:04:14.530 align:middle line:90%


01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:19.630 align:middle line:84%
So now, I think we
have done this before.

01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And now I want you to view
this t and q as an index.

01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Imagine this is just
a continuous index.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And then q is just
like a vector--

01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:34.690 align:middle line:90%
q t prime is like a vector.

01:04:34.690 --> 01:04:35.960 align:middle line:90%
q t is like a vector.

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.730 align:middle line:90%
And this is the same vector.

01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And now this is just a matrix
between the two vector.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:44.950 align:middle line:90%


01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:59.555 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can view q t as a
vector, with t as the index.

01:04:59.555 --> 01:05:04.740 align:middle line:90%


01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:10.340 align:middle line:90%
And then the k is the matrix--

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:15.100 align:middle line:90%


01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:25.130 align:middle line:84%
it's a matrix in
the space of q t.

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:38.470 align:middle line:90%


01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:44.740 align:middle line:84%
So when I write this form,
then this integral, dq t,

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:50.410 align:middle line:84%
so then we have this
Z T equal to dq t.

01:05:50.410 --> 01:05:52.390 align:middle line:84%
So for simplicity,
let me just suppress

01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:55.930 align:middle line:84%
the initial and the final
just for simplicity.

01:05:55.930 --> 01:06:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you just have i,
then 1/2 i dt dt prime.

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:09.930 align:middle line:90%
Also let me just suppress the--

01:06:09.930 --> 01:06:13.710 align:middle line:90%
then you have q dot k dot q.

01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Let me just use this
simplified notation.

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:21.930 align:middle line:90%
This is the same as that guy.

01:06:21.930 --> 01:06:22.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:24.570 align:middle line:84%
[AUDIENCE] Is this
like ad hoc that you

01:06:24.570 --> 01:06:26.820 align:middle line:84%
left the first q
as a function of t

01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and not made it a function
of t prime instead?

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:32.200 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.838 align:middle line:90%
You can do that it way, too.

01:06:33.838 --> 01:06:34.755 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it won't change.

01:06:34.755 --> 01:06:40.440 align:middle line:90%


01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.210 align:middle line:90%
So now you compare this form.

01:06:42.210 --> 01:06:45.390 align:middle line:90%


01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:49.380 align:middle line:84%
So now, this look like
a Gaussian integral.

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Now this look like
a Gaussian integral.

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:57.270 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's recall
your Gaussian integral,

01:06:57.270 --> 01:07:00.660 align:middle line:90%
which you'll be familiar with.

01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:07.540 align:middle line:84%
When you have the x exponential
minus a divided by 2x square,

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:10.885 align:middle line:84%
then that gives you
2 pi divided by a.

01:07:10.885 --> 01:07:15.580 align:middle line:90%


01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:17.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is a
one-dimensional integral.

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.320 align:middle line:84%
But you can also have an
n-dimensional integral.

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:33.990 align:middle line:90%


01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:36.390 align:middle line:90%
So here, the index is a sum.

01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:40.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is equal to
2 pi to the power

01:07:40.170 --> 01:07:51.660 align:middle line:84%
n divided by 2, square root
delta A, of this matrix A.

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So now this is just
a generalization

01:07:55.140 --> 01:08:02.250 align:middle line:84%
of this integral, except the
index becomes continuous.

01:08:02.250 --> 01:08:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And here, the k
have two indices.

01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:08.120 align:middle line:90%
It's just like m, n.

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.400 align:middle line:90%
So here is like q m and q n.

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.915 align:middle line:90%
And this is just like m n.

01:08:11.915 --> 01:08:15.530 align:middle line:90%


01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:17.479 align:middle line:84%
So this is just
like an ordinary--

01:08:17.479 --> 01:08:19.189 align:middle line:84%
this is just like
a Gaussian integral

01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:24.950 align:middle line:84%
but in the space of infinite
dimensional vectors.

01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:26.569 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, of course,
not just infinite.

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:28.402 align:middle line:84%
It's uncountable
infinite dimension,

01:08:28.402 --> 01:08:29.735 align:middle line:90%
because it's a continuous index.

01:08:29.735 --> 01:08:32.600 align:middle line:90%


01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:43.479 align:middle line:84%
So now with this understanding,
with this realization,

01:08:43.479 --> 01:08:45.430 align:middle line:84%
we can just directly
write down the answer.

01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:49.000 align:middle line:90%


01:08:49.000 --> 01:09:01.160 align:middle line:84%
We say then the Z T must be just
given by some constant divided

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.859 align:middle line:90%
by delta k, determinant k.

01:09:03.859 --> 01:09:10.310 align:middle line:90%


01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:12.319 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you just
generalize this formula.

01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:13.639 align:middle line:90%
You generalize this formula.

01:09:13.639 --> 01:09:16.630 align:middle line:90%


01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:19.090 align:middle line:84%
So just now, k is
the determinant

01:09:19.090 --> 01:09:23.350 align:middle line:84%
in the more complicated space,
in the space of functions.

01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:26.670 align:middle line:90%


01:09:26.670 --> 01:09:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So the only unfortunate thing
is that both C and the delta k

01:09:31.770 --> 01:09:34.260 align:middle line:90%
actually are divergent.

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:37.970 align:middle line:90%


01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:42.760 align:middle line:90%
So C is our constant.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And the delta K
is the determinant

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:57.280 align:middle line:90%
of K in the space of functions.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:04.480 align:middle line:90%


01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:06.640 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't like
the K is the matrix.

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:09.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a matrix defined
in the space of q t.

01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:11.860 align:middle line:90%
q t is the space of functions.

01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:15.450 align:middle line:90%


01:10:15.450 --> 01:10:18.630 align:middle line:84%
So this content
can be divergent.

01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:21.570 align:middle line:90%


01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:24.090 align:middle line:84%
But this doesn't matter,
as we will later see,

01:10:24.090 --> 01:10:29.070 align:middle line:84%
such a constant don't matter
very much for your physics.

01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I warned you before,
in quantum field theory,

01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:34.810 align:middle line:84%
we will see
divergences everywhere.

01:10:34.810 --> 01:10:37.490 align:middle line:84%
So the key is to recognize
which divergences are important

01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:40.500 align:middle line:84%
and which divergence
are not important.

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So unimportant divergence,
you just forget them.

01:10:44.730 --> 01:10:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so we will later see
that such a C will always

01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:51.900 align:middle line:84%
cancel when you can see
the physical quantities.

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:53.460 align:middle line:90%
And this will never matter.

01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:57.450 align:middle line:90%


01:10:57.450 --> 01:11:02.600 align:middle line:84%
But still, we need
to talk about how

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:05.360 align:middle line:90%
to think about the determinant.

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:10.170 align:middle line:84%
What do we mean by
determinant here?

01:11:10.170 --> 01:11:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So we do it in the
same way as you

01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:13.805 align:middle line:90%
would do in the matrix space.

01:11:13.805 --> 01:11:21.900 align:middle line:90%


01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:26.680 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a finite
dimensional matrix,

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:29.800 align:middle line:84%
there's a way to calculate
the determinant, yeah,

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:32.230 align:middle line:84%
the standard way,
which you learned.

01:11:32.230 --> 01:11:35.110 align:middle line:90%


01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Say a1, a1 1, a2 2, et cetera,
there's a complicated formula,

01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:40.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:46.570 align:middle line:84%
But that way does not
generalize to such a k,

01:11:46.570 --> 01:11:49.940 align:middle line:90%
with continuous indices.

01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:52.450 align:middle line:84%
So we must find a way to
generalize the determinant,

01:11:52.450 --> 01:11:59.320 align:middle line:84%
here, in a way, which can apply
to such a k, which is defined

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:02.060 align:middle line:90%
in the space of functions.

01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:04.030 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
way we can calculate

01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:12.010 align:middle line:84%
the determinant, a way without
using the standard formula.

01:12:12.010 --> 01:12:15.430 align:middle line:90%
So you do this as follows.

01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the
determinant of A is also

01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:22.460 align:middle line:84%
the product of all
the eigenvalues of A

01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:25.670 align:middle line:84%
So you can just find all
the eigenvalues of A.

01:12:25.670 --> 01:12:27.380 align:middle line:90%
You take the product of them.

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And then that is the
determinant of A.

01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:33.560 align:middle line:84%
So this way to
define determinant

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.360 align:middle line:90%
actually generalize.

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:38.240 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter how
many eigenvalues you have.

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:44.700 align:middle line:84%
So now we can just find
all the eigenvalues of k.

01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Just find all the
eigenvalues of k.

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And then we just take
the product of them.

01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:58.520 align:middle line:90%
That gives us the determinant.

01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:00.770 align:middle line:84%
So this is the way
which we can generalize.

01:13:00.770 --> 01:13:03.960 align:middle line:84%
So how do we define the
determinant eigenvalue?

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:08.090 align:middle line:84%
So when we define the
eigenvalue of A m n,

01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:16.430 align:middle line:84%
we find the eigenvector X
will satisfy this behavior.

01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:23.300 align:middle line:84%
So the n is summed, and
then give you a this, right?

01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:28.250 align:middle line:84%
So now the analog of the m
n, here, is t and t prime.

01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:37.020 align:middle line:84%
So the analog here is from 0
to T, t prime, k, t, t prime,

01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:38.490 align:middle line:90%
some function, f n.

01:13:38.490 --> 01:13:41.460 align:middle line:90%


01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:44.250 align:middle line:84%
So n, here, label
different eigenvalues.

01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:45.300 align:middle line:90%
So let me call it i.

01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:48.620 align:middle line:90%


01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:55.010 align:middle line:84%
i t prime, you go
to lambda i f t.

01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:57.890 align:middle line:90%


01:13:57.890 --> 01:14:01.220 align:middle line:84%
So this would be the
eigenvalue equation.

01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Because now, the n index, here,
is just replaced by t prime.

01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:10.290 align:middle line:84%
The sum over n just
replaced by integral.

01:14:10.290 --> 01:14:13.400 align:middle line:90%
And then the rest is the same.

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:17.870 align:middle line:84%
So you just find all the
eigenvalues of k the f t.

01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it should
satisfy the condition, here,

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:28.212 align:middle line:90%
the f 0 equal to f i--

01:14:28.212 --> 01:14:32.090 align:middle line:84%
yeah, f i T should satisfy
the boundary condition.

01:14:32.090 --> 01:14:33.200 align:middle line:90%
This is equal to 0.

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.330 align:middle line:90%
Because that's the integral.

01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:38.210 align:middle line:84%
That's the condition
of a path integral.

01:14:38.210 --> 01:14:40.760 align:middle line:84%
The path integral,
it's from 0 to 0.

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:48.110 align:middle line:90%


01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And you just solve this
eigenvalue problem.

01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:53.270 align:middle line:84%
This is a well-defined
mathematical problem.

01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Because k is just a
differential operator.

01:14:57.010 --> 01:14:58.870 align:middle line:84%
k is just some
differential operator.

01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And now, this becomes a
well-defined mathematical

01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:01.450 align:middle line:90%
problem.

01:15:01.450 --> 01:15:03.190 align:middle line:90%
We can find these eigenvalues.

01:15:03.190 --> 01:15:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And then we just
take the product.

01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:10.070 align:middle line:84%
So this way, we
generalize that formula.

01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:13.420 align:middle line:84%
So this is the exercise
for you to do yourself.

01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:16.180 align:middle line:90%
OK, k is just a quadratic.

01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Differential is
just delta t square.

01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:20.080 align:middle line:90%
It's very easy.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:21.025 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's very easy.

01:15:21.025 --> 01:15:24.870 align:middle line:90%


01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:29.950 align:middle line:90%
So you find f i t.

01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, actually,
I think i is also

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:35.830 align:middle line:90%
not a very fortunate notation.

01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:39.310 align:middle line:90%
Because it can be easily--

01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:43.470 align:middle line:84%
yeah, let me call
it j, OK, so pi j t.

01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:48.340 align:middle line:90%


01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:51.520 align:middle line:84%
So you can just solve this
equation, easily, yourself.

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:53.300 align:middle line:84%
So let me just write
down the answer.

01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:57.280 align:middle line:84%
So the eigenvalue
of pi j t divided

01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:02.230 align:middle line:84%
by capital T. And with
eigenvalues lambda j

01:16:02.230 --> 01:16:09.730 align:middle line:84%
equal to m j square, pi
squared, divided by t square.

01:16:09.730 --> 01:16:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And the j equal to
1, 2, et cetera.

01:16:13.690 --> 01:16:17.420 align:middle line:90%


01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:20.320 align:middle line:90%
So even though the k--

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:24.100 align:middle line:84%
both index of k are
continuous, but the eigenvalues

01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:27.400 align:middle line:84%
are discrete, OK, a
discrete infinite.

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.620 align:middle line:84%
The eigenvalue are discrete
infinite, just labeled

01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:31.245 align:middle line:90%
by integer j.

01:16:31.245 --> 01:16:32.620 align:middle line:84%
You can easily
convince yourself.

01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:35.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, just solve this equation.

01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:36.190 align:middle line:90%
It's easy to solve.

01:16:36.190 --> 01:16:40.810 align:middle line:90%


01:16:40.810 --> 01:16:43.065 align:middle line:84%
So now we can find
the determinant of k.

01:16:43.065 --> 01:16:49.350 align:middle line:90%


01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Now we find the
determinant of k.

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:56.340 align:middle line:84%
So this is given by
product of n equal to 1i--

01:16:56.340 --> 01:17:05.790 align:middle line:84%
j equal to 1, to
infinity, m j squared,

01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:07.346 align:middle line:90%
pi squared divided by t square.

01:17:07.346 --> 01:17:14.180 align:middle line:90%


01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:17.510 align:middle line:90%
So you say, what is this beast?

01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So we have all these
infinite things.

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:22.100 align:middle line:90%
We have these things.

01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:26.020 align:middle line:84%
We have all these constants
multiplied infinite times.

01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:29.320 align:middle line:90%
And then we have this j square.

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:31.330 align:middle line:90%
And so now I claim--

01:17:31.330 --> 01:17:34.330 align:middle line:90%


01:17:34.330 --> 01:17:37.810 align:middle line:84%
again, I will not have
time to do it here.

01:17:37.810 --> 01:17:44.560 align:middle line:84%
I will claim this guy,
once you do proper things,

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:46.810 align:middle line:84%
and then that gives
you that answer.

01:17:46.810 --> 01:17:49.870 align:middle line:84%
When you do that C over delta
t, that can get you back

01:17:49.870 --> 01:17:52.210 align:middle line:90%
to this answer.

01:17:52.210 --> 01:17:54.340 align:middle line:90%
Get you back to that answer.

01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:58.135 align:middle line:84%
So you will work through that
in your homework problem.

01:17:58.135 --> 01:18:05.060 align:middle line:90%


01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:11.840 align:middle line:84%
So this way, even
though it looks hairy,

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:14.660 align:middle line:84%
but once you get used
to it's much easier

01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:20.630 align:middle line:84%
than doing those integrals
and take the limit.

01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:24.020 align:middle line:84%
It's much easier than doing
this-- take the limit.

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:26.852 align:middle line:84%
And also, we will later
see, most of the time,

01:18:26.852 --> 01:18:29.060 align:middle line:84%
you actually don't need to
calculate the determinant,

01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:31.190 align:middle line:90%
explicitly.

01:18:31.190 --> 01:18:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Later, we will see,
most of the time,

01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:35.750 align:middle line:84%
you don't need to calculate
determinant, explicitly.

01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:38.150 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
use those things.

01:18:38.150 --> 01:18:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And just the path
integral framework

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:45.830 align:middle line:84%
somehow provide a platform
for you to do a lot of things.

01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:47.840 align:middle line:84%
You don't actually
need to evaluate it.

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:50.060 align:middle line:84%
It's actually
provides a platform.

01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:52.490 align:middle line:84%
That's the most important
thing about the path integral.

01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:55.700 align:middle line:84%
It's often not about
how you evaluate it.

01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:58.290 align:middle line:90%


01:18:58.290 --> 01:19:00.770 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:03.840 align:middle line:84%
So before we conclude, let me
just make some further remark.

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:06.600 align:middle line:90%


01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Because it's better if we
just make a couple of remarks

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:14.805 align:middle line:84%
here so that we don't
forget next time.

01:19:14.805 --> 01:19:23.370 align:middle line:90%


01:19:23.370 --> 01:19:26.725 align:middle line:84%
yeah give me like two
minutes to make some remark.

01:19:26.725 --> 01:19:45.380 align:middle line:90%


01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:49.190 align:middle line:84%
So remember remarks
I already said.

01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:51.980 align:middle line:84%
We said that this is a
new formulation of quantum

01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:56.150 align:middle line:84%
mechanics, gives you
a new conceptual way

01:19:56.150 --> 01:20:00.193 align:middle line:84%
to think about
quantum mechanics.

01:20:00.193 --> 01:20:01.610 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you a
new conceptual way

01:20:01.610 --> 01:20:05.240 align:middle line:84%
to think about
quantum mechanics.

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And you can show that these two
formulations are equivalent.

01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:12.890 align:middle line:90%
So this is equivalent.

01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:16.550 align:middle line:84%
You can show that this is
equivalent to the Schrodinger

01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:26.600 align:middle line:84%
approach, to the
Schrodinger formulation,

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:30.965 align:middle line:84%
by showing that the K,
you calculate it this way.

01:20:30.965 --> 01:20:33.770 align:middle line:90%


01:20:33.770 --> 01:20:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Using path integral,
you find this K.

01:20:37.490 --> 01:20:40.005 align:middle line:84%
You can show that the K actually
satisfies the Schrodinger

01:20:40.005 --> 01:20:40.505 align:middle line:90%
equation.

01:20:40.505 --> 01:20:52.350 align:middle line:90%


01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:54.662 align:middle line:90%
So this will guarantee--

01:20:54.662 --> 01:20:56.870 align:middle line:84%
I already erased-- that
guarantee your wave function,

01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:58.790 align:middle line:84%
when you come over to
this K, it will also

01:20:58.790 --> 01:21:01.190 align:middle line:84%
satisfy the
Schrodinger equation.

01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:03.050 align:middle line:84%
So you can show that
this actually satisfies

01:21:03.050 --> 01:21:04.092 align:middle line:90%
the Schrodinger equation.

01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:09.250 align:middle line:90%


01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:11.220 align:middle line:84%
So you can show that
the K actually satisfies

01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:12.540 align:middle line:90%
the Schrodinger equation.

01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Again, I will leave
it to your homework.

01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:21.180 align:middle line:90%


01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:21.930 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:21:21.930 --> 01:21:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And the second point
is just to highlight

01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:33.670 align:middle line:84%
this contrast between the
classical mechanics, which

01:21:33.670 --> 01:21:40.210 align:middle line:84%
have a fixed path determined
by equation of motion,

01:21:40.210 --> 01:21:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and the quantum, you just
sum over all possible paths

01:21:45.790 --> 01:21:48.550 align:middle line:90%
weighted by your action.

01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:50.020 align:middle line:90%
You just sum.

01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Just a contrast,
OK, just contrast.

01:21:52.270 --> 01:21:56.050 align:middle line:90%


01:21:56.050 --> 01:21:56.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:21:56.610 --> 01:21:58.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let's stop here.

01:21:58.630 --> 01:22:02.440 align:middle line:90%


01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:07.860 align:middle line:84%
So the next time, then we are
ready to go to field theory.

01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:11.880 align:middle line:84%
So with this, if you
are familiar with this,

01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:14.980 align:middle line:84%
if you are familiar with this,
get used to everything here,

01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:16.920 align:middle line:84%
then going to field
theory is just immediate.

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:19.020 align:middle line:84%
You're just changing
the notation.

01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Because, as we said,
the field theory

01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:23.250 align:middle line:84%
just goes on into quantum
mechanics with infinite number

01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:24.180 align:middle line:90%
of degrees of freedom.

01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:26.773 align:middle line:84%
Once you understand
1 degree of freedom,

01:22:26.773 --> 01:22:28.440 align:middle line:84%
then you can just
generalize to infinite

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:30.773 align:middle line:84%
number of degrees of freedom
just by changing notations.

01:22:30.773 --> 01:22:32.970 align:middle line:90%
So this aspect will be the same.

01:22:32.970 --> 01:22:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So we can immediately write down
the path integral for quantum

01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:38.640 align:middle line:90%
field theory next time.

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And then we can talk
about the interactions.

01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:45.000 align:middle line:90%
