00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.530 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: So in
the last lecture,

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.590 align:middle line:84%
we have concluded the
discussion of fermions.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And now, we go to the
last missing piece

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.090 align:middle line:84%
before we can talk
about the QED.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.540 align:middle line:84%
It's how to quantize
the Maxwell field, OK?

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.110 align:middle line:90%
How to get photon, OK?

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.940 align:middle line:90%
And so today, we start.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:49.680 align:middle line:90%


00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.640 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.670 align:middle line:90%
So this is a short chapter.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.500 align:middle line:84%
I think we should
be able to finish it

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.550 align:middle line:90%
just this week in two lectures.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.500 align:middle line:84%
So first, let me just
remind you of some aspects

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.440 align:middle line:90%
of the classical Maxwell theory.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.270 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And then we will talk about
this quantization, OK?

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.490 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.790 align:middle line:84%
So the Lagrangian, say,
for the classical Maxwell

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.430 align:middle line:90%
theory can be written as--

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.735 align:middle line:84%
Lagrangian density can
be written as F mu nu.

00:01:32.735 --> 00:01:37.010 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.800 align:middle line:84%
So F mu nu is just
the standard--

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.380 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.770 align:middle line:84%
partial mu A nu equal
to partial nu A mu.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.335 align:middle line:84%
And the J mu is just the
electromagnetic current.

00:01:51.335 --> 00:01:57.170 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:84%
J mu just
electromagnetic current.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.259 align:middle line:84%
And then so from this
Lagrangian density,

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.530 align:middle line:84%
then you can derive the
equation motion, which is just

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.360 align:middle line:90%
the Maxwell equation, OK?

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So the Maxwell equation is
given by partial mu F mu

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.220 align:middle line:90%
nu equal to minus J mu, OK?

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.260 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
familiar equation

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.680 align:middle line:84%
which we see from classical
electrodynamics, OK?

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And so if you act partial
mu on both sides--

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.195 align:middle line:84%
so now, let's consider act
partial mu on both sides.

00:02:54.195 --> 00:02:59.470 align:middle line:90%


00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Since F mu mu is, by
definition, antisymmetric,

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.680 align:middle line:90%
so this is automatically 0.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And so this tells you that
by consistency, the current

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.270 align:middle line:90%
has to be conserved, OK?

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.610 align:middle line:84%
The current which is appearing
on the right-hand side

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.860 align:middle line:84%
of the Maxwell equation
has to be conserved.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you don't have
a consistent equations, OK?

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:30.910 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And so another important
feature of the Maxwell equation

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.190 align:middle line:90%
is so-called the gauge symmetry.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.290 align:middle line:90%
So the Maxwell action--

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.060 align:middle line:84%
both the action and the equation
motion are invariant under--

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:90%
so the L, yeah the action.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.340 align:middle line:90%


00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.050 align:middle line:84%
So you integrate this
over full spacetime.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's invariant under the
following transformation--

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:24.080 align:middle line:84%
that A mu goes to A mu
prime equal to A mu plus

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.930 align:middle line:90%
partial mu lambda x.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.196 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:28.196 --> 00:04:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And here the lambda x
is an arbitrary function

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.590 align:middle line:90%
of spacetime coordinates, OK?

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.715 align:middle line:90%
It's an arbitrary function.

00:04:41.715 --> 00:04:44.370 align:middle line:90%


00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.610 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that
the Maxwell theory--

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:56.000 align:middle line:84%
the action is invariant
under this transformation.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So you can easily
check yourself.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Under this transformation,
F mu mu does not change, OK?

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.520 align:middle line:84%
So the transformation
between this and this-- they

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.720 align:middle line:90%
just cancel each other.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.485 align:middle line:90%
And so F mu nu does not change.

00:05:09.485 --> 00:05:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And then you see the equation
of motion, of course,

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.370 align:middle line:84%
is invariant under
this transformation

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.230 align:middle line:90%
because F mu nu does not change.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.450 align:middle line:90%
And J mu does not transform.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And also, the
action is invariant

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.250 align:middle line:84%
because the F mu
nu does not change.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And naively, this term does
change under the transformation

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.930 align:middle line:84%
because you have this
partial mu lambda,

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.420 align:middle line:84%
but the additional term
corresponding to partial mu

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.950 align:middle line:90%
lambda times J mu--

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.090 align:middle line:84%
but then you can do integration
by parts under the integration

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.840 align:middle line:90%
because J mu is conserved.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And so the action
is invariant, OK?

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.830 align:middle line:90%
So the action is invariant.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And so this symmetry is a little
bit different from the symmetry

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.600 align:middle line:84%
we have discussed before
because the symmetry depends

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.420 align:middle line:84%
on the function of
arbitrary spacetime,

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.250 align:middle line:90%
of spacetime coordinates.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:10.500 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So for this reason and
the previous symmetry

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.340 align:middle line:84%
we have talked about, the
transformation parameters

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.390 align:middle line:84%
are independent of the
spacetime coordinates, OK?

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.040 align:middle line:90%
They're constants.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.455 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why this is
called the local symmetry.

00:06:25.455 --> 00:06:33.400 align:middle line:90%


00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's also called,
just for historical reason,

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.705 align:middle line:90%
gauge symmetry.

00:06:37.705 --> 00:06:44.720 align:middle line:90%


00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.630 align:middle line:84%
It's called local symmetry
or gauge symmetry--

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.570 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:56.190 align:middle line:84%
and yeah, in contrast
to the global symmetry,

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.390 align:middle line:84%
which we encountered before,
whose transformation parameters

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.520 align:middle line:90%
are spacetime-independent.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:84%
So the gauge symmetry and
the global symmetries--

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.760 align:middle line:84%
even though they
are all symmetries,

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.960 align:middle line:84%
they have very, very different
physical interpretation, OK?

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So global symmetry is
a genuine symmetry.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:24.910 align:middle line:84%
So the theory's
translation variant

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.630 align:middle line:84%
means that what's
happening here in Boston

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.750 align:middle line:84%
is the same happening in,
say, Washington, DC, OK?

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Generally, things are
invariant under that.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.400 align:middle line:84%
But the local symmetry
is very different, OK?

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.275 align:middle line:90%
So the local symmetry means--

00:07:41.275 --> 00:07:47.510 align:middle line:90%


00:07:47.510 --> 00:08:00.620 align:middle line:84%
so the presence
of gauge symmetry

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:17.210 align:middle line:84%
implies that the system has
redundant degrees of freedom.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:31.380 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.000 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So let me just
give you a cartoon

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.190 align:middle line:90%
to illustrate this point.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:43.510 align:middle line:84%
So the space of A
mu, of course, is

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:90%
an infinite dimensional space.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:46.510 align:middle line:90%
But let me just--

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:51.940 align:middle line:84%
imagine this blackboard
is the space of A mu, OK?

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.460 align:middle line:90%
This plane is the space of A mu.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Under this gauge
transformation, it

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.700 align:middle line:90%
can be viewed as the following.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Say for each A mu, imagine
you make an arbitrary

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.780 align:middle line:90%
transformation--

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.370 align:middle line:90%
this lambda x.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.930 align:middle line:90%
And so this line--

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:21.250 align:middle line:84%
so let's denote the
space of lambda x.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.246 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:09:23.246 --> 00:09:26.553 align:middle line:84%
So at each point A mu, you
can make a transformation

00:09:26.553 --> 00:09:27.970 align:middle line:84%
for different
lambda corresponding

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.820 align:middle line:90%
to different points, OK?

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you start with
a different A mu,

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.380 align:middle line:90%
then you have a different--

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.010 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.660 align:middle line:90%
So each of them is called--

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:43.000 align:middle line:90%


00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:54.810 align:middle line:84%
so each of them is called the
orbit of gauge transformations.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.950 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.950 --> 00:09:59.940 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And they are parameterized
by lambda, OK?

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And they're
parameterized by lambda.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that the
physics is invariant

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.990 align:middle line:84%
under this transformation
means that the physics

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.050 align:middle line:84%
at this point for
this choice of A

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:19.470 align:middle line:84%
is the same as for
this choice of A, OK?

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, the
physics on this joint--

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:26.610 align:middle line:84%
just physics on the same
orbit is the same, OK?

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.300 align:middle line:90%
They describe the same physics.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
only a cross-section--

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.310 align:middle line:90%
so you can have many orbits, OK?

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:42.950 align:middle line:84%
So in each orbit, we can just
choose a representative point.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And then the
physics only depends

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:49.340 align:middle line:84%
on a cross-section of all
these different orbits, OK?

00:10:49.340 --> 00:11:07.150 align:middle line:84%
So physics only depends
on a cross-section, OK?

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:10.930 align:middle line:84%
So a cross-section
of this orbit, OK?

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:11.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.525 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: What's lambda?

00:11:13.525 --> 00:11:14.400 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.800 align:middle line:90%
Lambda.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.270 align:middle line:84%
So different points
corresponding

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.690 align:middle line:90%
to different lambda.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.060 align:middle line:84%
So you view this, really, as
an infinite dimensional space.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And so each point corresponding
to a different choice of lambda

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.190 align:middle line:84%
because lambda can be
arbitrary function, OK?

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.430 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:34.000 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Let me just parameterize
by lambda x.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:44.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:54.876 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.876 --> 00:12:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that we can choose
this lambda arbitrarily--

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:10.250 align:middle line:84%
so this means in
this case, there's

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:17.260 align:middle line:90%
one scalar degree of freedom.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.440 align:middle line:84%
So lambda is just
a scalar field.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:25.620 align:middle line:84%
It can be viewed as a scalar
field in spacetime coordinates.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So this one scalar degree
of freedom as parameterized

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:45.890 align:middle line:90%
by lambda is redundant.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.220 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Because any point
on this orbit--

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.770 align:middle line:84%
they carry exactly
the same physics.

00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:01.500 align:middle line:84%
They carry the
exact same physics.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:08.665 align:middle line:90%
And so any questions on this?

00:13:08.665 --> 00:13:12.420 align:middle line:90%


00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you remember
in classic E&M,

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:28.800 align:middle line:84%
when you solve the Maxwell
equation, the physical object

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.450 align:middle line:84%
or the physical
quantities-- they

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.420 align:middle line:84%
are all independent
of the choice.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:34.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.460 align:middle line:84%
So each choice of this
section is called a gauge, OK?

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.470 align:middle line:90%
Choice of a gauge.

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.387 align:middle line:84%
And so the choice
of a section is

00:13:43.387 --> 00:13:44.595 align:middle line:90%
called the choice of a gauge.

00:13:44.595 --> 00:13:49.370 align:middle line:90%


00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.380 align:middle line:84%
So when you solve
the Maxwell equation,

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.780 align:middle line:84%
typically, you choose
such a section.

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.400 align:middle line:90%
You choose a gauge.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.997 align:middle line:84%
And then you can just
solve the Maxwell equation

00:13:58.997 --> 00:14:01.580 align:middle line:84%
within that gauge so that you
no longer have redundant degrees

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.110 align:middle line:90%
of freedom, OK?

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.600 align:middle line:84%
So often, this gauge
is chosen so that you

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:84%
can solve the Maxwell
equation, simplify

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:14.620 align:middle line:84%
the task of solving the
Maxwell equation, OK?

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:84%
So we often solve the Maxwell
equation by fixing a gauge.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:34.930 align:middle line:90%


00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:35.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:44.070 align:middle line:84%
So there are two common
examples which we use

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.600 align:middle line:90%
to solve the Maxwell equations.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.210 align:middle line:84%
So one is called
the Coulomb gauge.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:55.630 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:56.130 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:56.130 --> 00:15:04.760 align:middle line:84%
So in this gauge, you require
the spatial components of A mu

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.190 align:middle line:90%
satisfy this equation, OK?

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:11.150 align:middle line:84%
So I will use the
notation that A mu

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:14.240 align:middle line:84%
equal to phi-- so the
zeroth component I call phi.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And then the spatial
component, the time component

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.930 align:middle line:84%
I call phi and the spatial
component I just call A vector.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And also, I often write
J mu as the rho, which

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:33.272 align:middle line:84%
is a charge density and then
the electric current j, OK?

00:15:33.272 --> 00:15:36.968 align:middle line:90%


00:15:36.968 --> 00:15:41.750 align:middle line:84%
So in this Coulomb gauge,
then the Maxwell equation

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.290 align:middle line:90%
is simplified.

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:43.790 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.410 align:middle line:90%
So you look at this equation.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And you look at
different components, OK?

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And so we're not
going into detail.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.397 align:middle line:84%
Let me just write
down the answer.

00:15:52.397 --> 00:15:53.870 align:middle line:84%
When you impose
this Coulomb gauge,

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:57.380 align:middle line:84%
you find the Maxwell equation
becomes the following.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:03.150 align:middle line:90%
So let me call this equation 1.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:04.650 align:middle line:90%
Call this equation star.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:07.500 align:middle line:84%
So in the Coulomb
gauge, you find

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.090 align:middle line:90%
the equation star becomes--

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:11.610 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:17.640 align:middle line:84%
so the time component becomes
the so-called Poisson equation.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.390 align:middle line:90%


00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And then the spatial
component becomes like this.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:37.680 align:middle line:90%


00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.180 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.770 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.660 align:middle line:90%
So you get these two equations.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:47.040 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.630 align:middle line:84%
So let's just remind you a
little bit of the physics

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.750 align:middle line:84%
encoded in these
two equations, OK?

00:16:53.750 --> 00:17:07.650 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
equation in which we

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:12.810 align:middle line:84%
can use rho, the charge
density distribution,

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.869 align:middle line:84%
to solve for the
electric potential,

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:18.390 align:middle line:90%
for the scalar potential.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.579 align:middle line:84%
But notice that this
equation does not

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:22.170 align:middle line:90%
involve time derivatives.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:37.920 align:middle line:90%


00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.500 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.510 align:middle line:90%
So this is not dynamical.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:44.100 align:middle line:90%
So phi is not dynamical.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:54.050 align:middle line:90%


00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.270 align:middle line:84%
It's determined
by rho instantly.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:18:09.800 align:middle line:90%


00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.730 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:16.850 align:middle line:84%
So this means that the
configuration of phi at a given

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:21.020 align:middle line:84%
time is just determined by
the configuration of rho

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.090 align:middle line:90%
exactly at that given time, OK?

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's no dynamics
in the phi itself, OK?

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.610 align:middle line:84%
There's no time
derivative in phi.

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:30.152 align:middle line:84%
There's no dynamic
in the phi itself.

00:18:30.152 --> 00:18:33.000 align:middle line:90%


00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.145 align:middle line:90%
So this is first.

00:18:34.145 --> 00:18:36.650 align:middle line:90%


00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:43.470 align:middle line:84%
The second thing-- is that let's
see what this Coulomb gauge

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.640 align:middle line:90%
condition means.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
this condition,

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.300 align:middle line:90%
when you go to momentum space--

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.630 align:middle line:84%
so this Fourier transform
goes to momentum space.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And then that just become
k dot A equal to 0, OK?

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.260 align:middle line:90%
So that just means that--

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:00.830 align:middle line:90%
yes?

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.205 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: This is
a technicality,

00:19:02.205 --> 00:19:04.990 align:middle line:84%
but in the expression
for A, shouldn't it

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:10.210 align:middle line:84%
be minus phi because
it's A sub u, right?

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:11.860 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: Which
should be minus phi?

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:16.293 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: A sub u equals minus
phi comma A. Because in the--

00:19:16.293 --> 00:19:16.960 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.340 align:middle line:90%
Which equation do you say is--

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.300 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Oh, right
under Coulomb gauge.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:20.930 align:middle line:90%
In i.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:21.640 align:middle line:90%
No, you're there.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.640 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: You mean here?

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.400 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, above that.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:23.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.760 align:middle line:84%
HONG LIU: No, this is
my convention, right?

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:26.105 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:19:26.105 --> 00:19:26.730 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:27.647 align:middle line:90%
This is my convention.

00:19:27.647 --> 00:19:28.188 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:19:28.188 --> 00:19:28.900 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.100 align:middle line:90%
You can call it minus phi.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.430 align:middle line:90%
You can call it positive phi.

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:33.310 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.690 align:middle line:90%


00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:40.250 align:middle line:84%
So in momentum space, you
can just write it as this.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:47.350 align:middle line:84%
So this just means that
the component of A parallel

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:50.470 align:middle line:90%
to the momentum is 0, OK?

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:54.890 align:middle line:84%
A only has component which is
perpendicular to the momentum

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.010 align:middle line:90%
and to the spatial momentum.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:04.870 align:middle line:84%
So we can separate, write
A as the longitudinal

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:08.140 align:middle line:90%
plus A transverse, OK?

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.080 align:middle line:84%
The longitudinal is defined
to be the component of A,

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.390 align:middle line:90%
which is proportional to k.

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:15.460 align:middle line:90%
So A i L--

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.010 align:middle line:84%
when you go to
the Fourier space,

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:21.580 align:middle line:84%
it will be
proportional to k, OK?

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And then the A i T will
be transverse to k,

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.310 align:middle line:84%
means that A iT dot
ki is equal to 0.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.900 align:middle line:90%
Then the Coulomb gauge means--

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:47.150 align:middle line:90%


00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:54.330 align:middle line:84%
this means that A is
equal to A transpose, OK?

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Just A transpose-- just
longitudinal part is 0, OK?

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:58.890 align:middle line:84%
The part proportional
to the momentum is 0.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.810 align:middle line:90%


00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:07.330 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can
already see what--

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:10.450 align:middle line:84%
so I just combine
these two features.

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Then how many dynamical
degrees freedom

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.705 align:middle line:90%
does the Maxwell theory have?

00:21:16.705 --> 00:21:21.500 align:middle line:90%


00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.207 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:21:22.207 --> 00:21:22.790 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.260 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Why is it two?

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.060 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Because
phi is not dynamical,

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.020 align:middle line:90%
so you don't care about that.

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:27.395 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:21:27.395 --> 00:21:28.820 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: You have
two transverse.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:29.778 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: That's right.

00:21:29.778 --> 00:21:31.220 align:middle line:90%
The phi is not dynamical.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:32.030 align:middle line:90%
We don't care.

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.070 align:middle line:90%
And then this Ai is 0.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And so you only have the
transverse component.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.420 align:middle line:84%
The transverse component is
perpendicular to the momentum

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:39.920 align:middle line:90%
direction.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And you only have two
independent components, OK?

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:53.660 align:middle line:84%
So we find there are only two
transverse dynamical degrees

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:54.160 align:middle line:90%
freedom.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:22:00.760 align:middle line:90%


00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, this is
the two polarizations.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Classically, this is just
corresponding two polarizations

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.220 align:middle line:90%
of electromagnetic wave, OK?

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:18.020 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
the EM wave, you only

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.210 align:middle line:84%
have two independent
polarizations.

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:23.650 align:middle line:90%


00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:26.430 align:middle line:84%
You only have two
independent polarizations.

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:31.450 align:middle line:84%
So this is the story
for the Coulomb gauge.

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:33.220 align:middle line:84%
So Coulomb gauge
is very convenient

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.880 align:middle line:84%
and has been widely
used-- in particular,

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.630 align:middle line:84%
in the nonrelativistic
situations when you don't

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:44.530 align:middle line:90%
involve very fast velocity.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:48.025 align:middle line:84%
But the Coulomb gauge, of
course, is not perfect.

00:22:48.025 --> 00:22:50.620 align:middle line:90%


00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.430 align:middle line:84%
So there are some drawbacks
of the Coulomb gauge.

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:59.340 align:middle line:84%
So first, there is no
manifest Lorentz symmetry.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:03.540 align:middle line:90%


00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:09.720 align:middle line:84%
So the Maxwell equation is
manifestly Lorentz covariant,

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:19.770 align:middle line:84%
but the Coulomb gauge is
not because this condition

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.320 align:middle line:90%
certainly is not covariant, OK?

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.280 align:middle line:90%
It is not covariant.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not the same in
different frames, OK?

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And the one consequence of this
loss of the manifest Lorentz

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:41.740 align:middle line:84%
covariance is this phi equation
is determined instantaneously.

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:46.150 align:middle line:84%
So we know that when you
have the relativistic theory,

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:49.480 align:middle line:84%
then everything should
propagate smaller

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.490 align:middle line:90%
than the speed of light, OK?

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And so you cannot have such
instant action at a distance.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:84%
So this implies the instant
action at a distance, OK?

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:05.337 align:middle line:84%
And this is an artifact
of the Coulomb gauge.

00:24:05.337 --> 00:24:07.045 align:middle line:84%
This is an artifact
of the Coulomb gauge.

00:24:07.045 --> 00:24:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And the underlying physics
is certainly not, OK?

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:14.020 align:middle line:84%
So for example, one
consequence of this

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:18.340 align:middle line:84%
is that the causality
is not manifest.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:24.610 align:middle line:90%


00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:25.360 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Because you have instant
action at a distance.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:45.490 align:middle line:90%


00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:49.230 align:middle line:84%
But remember that phi itself
is not physically observable.

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So we cannot observe
phi physically.

00:24:54.270 --> 00:25:00.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's OK for phi to
have an instant action.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.223 align:middle line:84%
But of course, the electric
field, the magnetic field--

00:25:04.223 --> 00:25:04.890 align:middle line:90%
they are causal.

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:05.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.126 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So if we impose a
Lorentz invariant condition

00:25:09.126 --> 00:25:12.485 align:middle line:84%
on the gauge, do we not
get any [INAUDIBLE]??

00:25:12.485 --> 00:25:13.610 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah, we are not.

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:14.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:15.620 align:middle line:90%
We'll be manifest.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:16.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:19.730 align:middle line:84%
This also will not
break the causality.

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Just the causality
is not manifest

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:28.050 align:middle line:84%
because this phi is not
physical, directly observable.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:31.390 align:middle line:90%


00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:31.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:34.080 align:middle line:90%
So then that motivates.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the
Coulomb gauge are

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.340 align:middle line:84%
mostly suitable in
the case involving

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:44.555 align:middle line:84%
low velocities in the
nonrelativistic situation.

00:25:44.555 --> 00:25:45.055 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:45.055 --> 00:25:48.830 align:middle line:90%


00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:56.960 align:middle line:84%
So the second-- but in a
more relativistic situation,

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:02.840 align:middle line:84%
people often consider
so-called Lorentz gauge.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.900 align:middle line:84%
So the Lorentz gauge
is defined to be

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:13.060 align:middle line:90%
partial mu A nu equal to 0, OK?

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:14.530 align:middle line:90%
So the partial mu x--

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:19.390 align:middle line:84%
now, this equation is covariant
because index are contracted.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is a covariant
equation, OK?

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.460 align:middle line:90%
So this is a covariant equation.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And so the Lorentz
covariance is manifest.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Then the Maxwell equation--
so under this gauge, then

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:43.140 align:middle line:84%
the equation star now
becomes very simple.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:48.340 align:middle line:90%


00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:48.840 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.860 align:middle line:90%
It just becomes that.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:51.360 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.540 align:middle line:84%
So you see, this equation
is indeed covariant, OK?

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.580 align:middle line:90%
So the derivative contracted.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.620 align:middle line:90%
And then you have J mu, OK?

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.630 align:middle line:84%
So now, this is something
we are familiar--

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:07.130 align:middle line:84%
this is like you have four
independent scalar fields--

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:12.410 align:middle line:84%
massless scalar fields-- but
each of them has a source, OK?

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So that's the situation which
you actually see in your pset,

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.330 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:19.710 align:middle line:84%
In Pset, you look at the
scalar field with the source.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And so this is like four
independent scalar fields.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.730 align:middle line:90%
Each is sourced by J mu.

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:30.560 align:middle line:84%
But of course, they
are not independent

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.780 align:middle line:84%
because we have this
gauge condition, OK?

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.050 align:middle line:90%
We have this gauge condition.

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And also, this gauge
condition, of course,

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:39.850 align:middle line:84%
is compatible with this
equation because if you

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:45.670 align:middle line:84%
act partial mu on both sides,
and then because of this gauge

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:49.150 align:middle line:84%
condition, the left side is 0
and the right-hand side is also

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:51.445 align:middle line:90%
0 from the current conservation.

00:27:51.445 --> 00:28:04.320 align:middle line:90%


00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:14.280 align:middle line:84%
So now, let me also make some
remarks on the Lorentz gauge.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.350 align:middle line:84%
The Lorentz gauge is very
convenient because it gives you

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:22.570 align:middle line:84%
seemingly decoupled equations
between different A mu, OK?

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:24.246 align:middle line:90%
Between different A mu.

00:28:24.246 --> 00:28:27.592 align:middle line:90%


00:28:27.592 --> 00:28:33.680 align:middle line:84%
So the Lorentz
gauge also suffers

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.180 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of a problem, OK?

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.500 align:middle line:90%
Inconvenience.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Because the Lorentz gauge does
not fix the gauge completely,

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:41.510 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:41.510 --> 00:29:04.660 align:middle line:84%
So after-- Lorentz gauge does
not fix the gauge freedom

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.720 align:middle line:90%
completely.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:12.250 align:middle line:84%
So there's still some residual
gauge symmetry left, OK?

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:17.600 align:middle line:90%
So consider A mu.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Goes to A mu plus
partial mu phi, OK?

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:34.415 align:middle line:84%
And if phi satisfies partial
mu, partial nu equal to 0--

00:29:34.415 --> 00:29:37.880 align:middle line:90%


00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:43.970 align:middle line:84%
if phi satisfies this equation,
then this preserves the gauge--

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:49.700 align:middle line:90%


00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.140 align:middle line:90%
preserves the condition.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:54.680 align:middle line:90%


00:29:54.680 --> 00:30:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Preserves this condition if
phi satisfies the equation, OK?

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So this tells you that the
gauge freedom is not completely

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.520 align:middle line:90%
fixed, OK?

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you look
at this freedom,

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:25.830 align:middle line:84%
so here it's like
you can shift --

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:29.490 align:middle line:84%
lambda is an arbitrary
scalar field.

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:31.570 align:middle line:90%
It's an arbitrary function.

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:35.400 align:middle line:84%
So you can view it as an
arbitrary scalar field, OK?

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.010 align:middle line:90%
With no constraints, OK?

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:39.570 align:middle line:90%
With no constraint.

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:43.050 align:middle line:84%
We can say it's an arbitrary
off-shell scalar field, OK?

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:46.740 align:middle line:84%
But now, after you
fix the Lorentz gauge,

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:50.730 align:middle line:84%
you find that there's still
some remaining gauge freedom--

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:52.830 align:middle line:84%
and the remaining gauge
freedom corresponding

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:56.710 align:middle line:84%
to an on-shell massive
scalar field, OK?

00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:58.960 align:middle line:90%
Still, if phi satisfies this--

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.200 align:middle line:84%
because this equation is
like an equation of motion

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.920 align:middle line:90%
for a massless scalar field.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And so after you fix
the Lorentz gauge,

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:10.180 align:middle line:84%
there's still a freedom of the
on-shell massless scalar field

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:12.980 align:middle line:90%
left, OK?

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:16.350 align:middle line:90%
So this is the first remark.

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So the second remark
is related to--

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:24.000 align:middle line:90%
later, we are going to--

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.990 align:middle line:84%
how we treat, say, this Lorentz
gauge to quantize it, OK?

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:34.590 align:middle line:90%
So this is an alternative way.

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:36.990 align:middle line:84%
So you can just fix
the Lorentz gauge, say,

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:38.247 align:middle line:90%
in your equation of motion.

00:31:38.247 --> 00:31:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Just in your equation of motion,
anywhere, you see this thing.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:42.630 align:middle line:90%
You set it to be 0, OK?

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:45.570 align:middle line:84%
But we can also actually
impose the Lorentz gauge

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.790 align:middle line:90%
at the action level, OK?

00:31:47.790 --> 00:32:08.000 align:middle line:84%
So we can fix the Lorentz gauge
as the action level as follows.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.210 align:middle line:90%
So we consider a new action--

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:17.680 align:middle line:84%
say, a new Lagrangian
related to the previous one

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:23.950 align:middle line:90%
by a shift like this, OK?

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:26.530 align:middle line:90%
And the lambda here--

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:27.400 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.420 align:middle line:90%
Let me not use lambda.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:32.710 align:middle line:90%


00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:34.360 align:middle line:90%
So that should be not--

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.830 align:middle line:90%
yeah, just xi, OK?

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:37.645 align:middle line:84%
So xi here is
arbitrary constant.

00:32:37.645 --> 00:32:46.580 align:middle line:90%


00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:47.608 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:32:47.608 --> 00:32:48.650 align:middle line:90%
Xi is arbitrary constant.

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:52.180 align:middle line:90%


00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's look
at this new theory

00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:00.500 align:middle line:84%
we just obtained from
the original theory

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.990 align:middle line:90%
by adding this term, OK?

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:06.520 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's look at
this equation of motion.

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at this
equation of motion,

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:11.630 align:middle line:84%
then you find it's given
by the following form.

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:14.380 align:middle line:90%
Partial square A mu.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:18.270 align:middle line:84%
So partial square just means
the partial nu partial nu, OK?

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:24.925 align:middle line:84%
And then you have lambda
minus 1 partial mu--

00:33:24.925 --> 00:33:30.010 align:middle line:90%
partial nu A mu equal J mu, OK?

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:33.440 align:middle line:90%
You find the equation like this.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.030 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:38.530 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:42.710 align:middle line:90%


00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So you see an
equation like this.

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:54.750 align:middle line:84%
So you get this new term because
of in the Lagrangian, OK?

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:58.335 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's act
partial mu on both sides.

00:33:58.335 --> 00:34:06.840 align:middle line:90%


00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.929 align:middle line:84%
Since the current is
conserved, and then

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:13.969 align:middle line:84%
when you act partial mu here,
you get partial mu A mu.

00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:16.639 align:middle line:84%
And then yeah, you
just combine together.

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:22.489 align:middle line:84%
You find you get partial square
partial mu A mu equal to 0.

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:26.840 align:middle line:90%


00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you act the
partial mu on both sides,

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:33.030 align:middle line:90%
you find that this equal to 0.

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:40.020 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can impose partial
mu A mu equal to 0, OK?

00:34:40.020 --> 00:35:07.110 align:middle line:84%
We can enforce with star star by
imposing boundary conditions so

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:18.520 align:middle line:84%
that this equation only has
trivial solutions, which

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.935 align:middle line:84%
means that this partial
mu A mu is equal to 0, OK?

00:35:20.935 --> 00:35:25.060 align:middle line:90%


00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:25.630 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:28.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm running out
of space here, OK?

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:31.930 align:middle line:90%
So you have this equation.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And now, you can enforce
the Lorentz gauge

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:39.420 align:middle line:84%
by putting the
boundary conditions

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:42.710 align:middle line:84%
so that this equation
only has 0 solution, OK?

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And then equivalently, then you
have imposed the Lorentz gauge.

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:50.920 align:middle line:84%
But the nice thing
of this approach

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:57.470 align:middle line:84%
is that now, you can
treat it as action-level.

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And the advantage, we
will see later, OK?

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:03.133 align:middle line:84%
Because in quantum
theory, the action

00:36:03.133 --> 00:36:04.550 align:middle line:84%
is very important--
in particular,

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:07.260 align:middle line:90%
when you do the path integral.

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:11.130 align:middle line:84%
In particular, when you
do the path integral.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:12.900 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:13.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:14.340 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Could you
go into a little bit

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.752 align:middle line:84%
more detail about what
the specific [INAUDIBLE]??

00:36:16.752 --> 00:36:20.020 align:middle line:90%


00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.040 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:26.070 align:middle line:84%
We will do it
later in your Pset.

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:28.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:28.700 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:33.500 align:middle line:90%


00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:34.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:37.820 align:middle line:84%
So we will touch
on this question.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:41.150 align:middle line:84%
We will touch on this
question when we quantize it.

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:43.840 align:middle line:84%
This feature will
become very important.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you will
have an opportunity

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:50.720 align:middle line:84%
to work out in
detail in your Pset.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.050 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:53.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:56.420 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is there a
subtlety as to why you--

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:59.250 align:middle line:84%
does it matter when you fix
your gauge at the action level

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:01.910 align:middle line:84%
or later on with your
equation of motion?

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:02.535 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:37:02.535 --> 00:37:05.170 align:middle line:90%
It's just a little bit easier.

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:06.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Later, when we do
the path integral,

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.277 align:middle line:90%
you will see it's easier.

00:37:09.277 --> 00:37:09.777 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:09.777 --> 00:37:13.300 align:middle line:90%


00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Classically, there
is no difference.

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:18.210 align:middle line:84%
But quantum mechanically,
we always want to do

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:20.990 align:middle line:90%
is at the action level.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:22.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.840 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.190 align:middle line:90%


00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:27.060 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:28.080 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:28.890 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we have an extra constant,
but the physics should not

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:33.870 align:middle line:90%
depend on this constant.

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:39.450 align:middle line:90%


00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:42.010 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:43.660 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:52.060 align:middle line:84%
So let me just point out--
when xi is equal to 1,

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:56.130 align:middle line:84%
the story is
particularly simple.

00:37:56.130 --> 00:38:00.830 align:middle line:84%
So for general xi, you get
this more complicated equation,

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:02.720 align:middle line:84%
but for xi equal
to 1, you notice

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.670 align:middle line:90%
that here this term is just 0.

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And then even with
this new Lagrangian,

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:13.790 align:middle line:84%
you get exactly the
same equation of motion

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:19.370 align:middle line:84%
as if you have imposed
the Lorentz gauge

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:22.130 align:middle line:90%
in the equation of motion, OK?

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:24.665 align:middle line:84%
So xi equal to 1 is
particularly simple.

00:38:24.665 --> 00:38:29.670 align:middle line:90%


00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:32.445 align:middle line:84%
So xi equal to 1 is particularly
simple for a reason.

00:38:32.445 --> 00:38:36.470 align:middle line:90%


00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:44.130 align:middle line:84%
So if you put the
xi equal to 1 here,

00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:45.880 align:middle line:84%
then you will find
that this term actually

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:49.660 align:middle line:84%
cancel with some of the
terms in this L exactly.

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:56.030 align:middle line:84%
So actually, when
xi is equal to 1,

00:38:56.030 --> 00:39:02.500 align:middle line:84%
you find that the Lagrangian
becomes the following.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:12.990 align:middle line:84%
It becomes 1/2 partial mu A
nu partial mu A nu minus J

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:14.960 align:middle line:90%
mu A nu, OK?

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.300 align:middle line:90%
It just becomes very simple.

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Again, just the
action now becomes

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:22.580 align:middle line:84%
like you have just a bunch
of free scalar fields, OK?

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:23.565 align:middle line:90%
Massless scalar fields.

00:39:23.565 --> 00:39:27.315 align:middle line:90%


00:39:27.315 --> 00:39:27.815 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:39:27.815 --> 00:39:42.330 align:middle line:90%


00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:42.830 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:43.820 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.990 align:middle line:90%


00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:48.233 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:39:48.233 --> 00:39:49.622 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: For the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:49.622 --> 00:39:52.197 align:middle line:90%


00:39:52.197 --> 00:39:53.030 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Oh, sorry.

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:56.130 align:middle line:90%


00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:58.537 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so this mu
should be downstairs.

00:39:58.537 --> 00:40:03.240 align:middle line:90%


00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:03.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:06.950 align:middle line:84%
So just even at
the action level,

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:09.435 align:middle line:84%
it looks like we have four
decoupled massless scalar

00:40:09.435 --> 00:40:09.935 align:middle line:90%
fields.

00:40:09.935 --> 00:40:16.940 align:middle line:90%


00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:19.110 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:20.630 align:middle line:90%
So now, we are ready.

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:24.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is a quick review
of the classical story.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.860 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's discuss
how to quantize it.

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:45.110 align:middle line:90%


00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:45.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:51.470 align:middle line:90%


00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And so again, we will first
do the standard canonical

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.860 align:middle line:90%
quantization, OK?

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Write down the most
general solutions

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:02.990 align:middle line:90%
to the operator equations.

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:08.368 align:middle line:84%
And then we will discuss
using the path integral, OK?

00:41:08.368 --> 00:41:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Using the path integral--
the path integral

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:14.660 align:middle line:84%
is convenient for
treating interactions.

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And the canonical approach is
convenient for understanding

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:26.930 align:middle line:84%
what's the physical degrees
freedom, to understand

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:30.940 align:middle line:90%
what's going on physically, OK?

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:35.560 align:middle line:84%
So for simplicity, let's
just forget about J mu, OK?

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:38.080 align:middle line:84%
So let's just look at the
Maxwell theory itself.

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:41.660 align:middle line:90%


00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So J mu does not do anything
in terms of quantization

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.980 align:middle line:90%
of the Maxwell theory, OK?

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.500 align:middle line:84%
So we don't need
to worry about it

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:53.750 align:middle line:90%
when we quantize this theory.

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:59.180 align:middle line:84%
So this theory is
quadratic in A mu.

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:04.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is what we
call a free theory, OK?

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:05.960 align:middle line:90%
Because it's quadratic in A mu.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.090 align:middle line:90%
There's no interaction, OK?

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:12.380 align:middle line:84%
So in the absence of
source, in the absence

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:15.680 align:middle line:84%
of the charge density
or current density,

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:20.450 align:middle line:84%
the Maxwell theory has
no self-interaction, OK?

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:21.690 align:middle line:90%
Has no self-interaction.

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:30.280 align:middle line:84%
So the photon is free in
the absence of sources.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.515 align:middle line:90%
So this is a free theory.

00:42:31.515 --> 00:42:39.752 align:middle line:90%


00:42:39.752 --> 00:42:41.210 align:middle line:84%
But the quantization
of this theory

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:45.745 align:middle line:84%
is actually very subtle due
to the following reasons, OK?

00:42:45.745 --> 00:42:49.130 align:middle line:90%


00:42:49.130 --> 00:43:01.110 align:middle line:90%
So subtleties in quantization.

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:05.210 align:middle line:90%


00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:17.337 align:middle line:84%
First, is that because
of the gauge symmetry,

00:43:17.337 --> 00:43:18.920 align:middle line:84%
there's a redundant
degree of freedom.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:26.510 align:middle line:90%


00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:27.010 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:28.468 align:middle line:84%
They are redundant
degrees freedom,

00:43:28.468 --> 00:43:31.720 align:middle line:90%
which are unphysical, OK?

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.160 align:middle line:90%
Which are unphysical.

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:37.900 align:middle line:90%
So we want to only quantize--

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:43.150 align:middle line:84%
should quantize-- only
physical degrees freedom.

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:50.490 align:middle line:90%


00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:51.820 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:55.060 align:middle line:84%
So this is much more
subtle at the quantum

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.070 align:middle line:90%
level than the classical level.

00:43:57.070 --> 00:44:00.790 align:middle line:84%
So at the classical level,
we just fix the gauge, OK?

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:03.380 align:middle line:90%
Then that's it.

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:06.950 align:middle line:84%
But at the quantum level,
things fluctuate, OK?

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:11.330 align:middle line:84%
So you have to make sure
the fluctuations you look at

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:13.760 align:middle line:84%
are corresponding to
physical fluctuations, not

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.550 align:middle line:84%
corresponding to fluctuations
of those unphysical degrees

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:17.810 align:middle line:90%
freedom, OK?

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And so that makes the
quantum theory more subtle

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:23.150 align:middle line:90%
compared with classical, OK?

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:25.970 align:middle line:90%


00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And the second subtlety is
that F mu nu is antisymmetric.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:36.440 align:middle line:90%


00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So the second one
is more technical.

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:42.950 align:middle line:90%
So this one is very conceptual.

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:48.610 align:middle line:90%


00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:49.810 align:middle line:90%
It's antisymmetric.

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So that means there's
no partial 0A0 term, OK?

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Because this is symmetric
between the two indices.

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And these are antisymmetric
between two indices.

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:06.470 align:middle line:90%
There's no A0 partial 0 A0.

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Then that means there's
no time derivative term

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:12.980 align:middle line:84%
for the A0 component
in your action, OK?

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:34.780 align:middle line:84%
So that means L does not
contain time derivatives of A0.

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.390 align:middle line:90%


00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:44.680 align:middle line:84%
So this means that if we look at
the momentum conjugate to A0--

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:49.350 align:middle line:90%


00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:53.250 align:middle line:84%
we should look at the
Lagrangian density

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:56.790 align:middle line:84%
divided by time derivative is
0-- this is just identically 0.

00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:59.760 align:middle line:90%


00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.340 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is corresponding
to a constrained equation.

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:08.240 align:middle line:90%


00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:11.950 align:middle line:84%
This does not express
a canonical momentum

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:15.010 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the A0 dot, OK?

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:17.613 align:middle line:84%
Or the time derivative
of anything.

00:46:17.613 --> 00:46:19.030 align:middle line:84%
So this is a
constrained equation.

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And again, if you want
to treat properly,

00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:25.520 align:middle line:84%
we have to use constrained
quantization, OK?

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:29.270 align:middle line:84%
We have to use
constrained quantization.

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And so this leads
to subtleties, OK?

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:36.780 align:middle line:90%


00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Remember-- we said since the
constrained allowing-- we

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:48.960 align:middle line:84%
already discussed for
the Dirac equation.

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And there we avoided going into
such constrained quantization

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:55.380 align:middle line:90%
by using a trick.

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And here we will
do similarly, OK?

00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:59.730 align:middle line:84%
We will not directly deal
with constrained quantization,

00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:02.310 align:middle line:84%
but we use some trick
to go around this issue.

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:04.390 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.920 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And so let me just
write down by passing

00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:18.090 align:middle line:84%
the canonical momentum due to
Ai, then this is Ai dot, OK?

00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:19.750 align:middle line:90%
Dot is the time derivative.

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And then so this is
corresponding to minus F0i.

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And then this gives
you just Ei, OK?

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:31.427 align:middle line:84%
So the canonical momentum
corresponding to Ai

00:47:31.427 --> 00:47:32.385 align:middle line:90%
is just electric field.

00:47:32.385 --> 00:47:39.180 align:middle line:90%


00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:40.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.500 align:middle line:90%
So it's just electric field.

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.150 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:53.190 align:middle line:84%
So with this warning, then let's
proceed to quantize the theory,

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:54.030 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:58.210 align:middle line:84%
So as we said, we want to only
quantize on a cross-section,

00:47:58.210 --> 00:47:58.710 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:03.810 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to quantize those
unphysical degrees freedom, OK?

00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Those unphysical
degrees freedom.

00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:08.328 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
fix the gauge, OK?

00:48:08.328 --> 00:48:09.495 align:middle line:90%
So we have to fix the gauge.

00:48:09.495 --> 00:48:43.450 align:middle line:90%


00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:43.950 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So first, let's see how to
do it in the Coulomb gauge.

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:54.960 align:middle line:84%
So Coulomb gauge is
conceptually simple, OK?

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:58.790 align:middle line:90%


00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:01.970 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, so in
the absence of source,

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:03.710 align:middle line:90%
let's look at the two equations.

00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:09.587 align:middle line:84%
And then again, we follow
the same strategy as before.

00:49:09.587 --> 00:49:11.170 align:middle line:84%
We follow the same
strategy as before.

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:13.990 align:middle line:84%
We first find the most
general classical solution.

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And then we turn that into the
quantum operator solution, OK?

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:20.470 align:middle line:90%
The same strategy.

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:24.510 align:middle line:84%
So in the Coulomb gauge,
then we have two equations.

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And then we just have
phi squared equal to 0,

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:39.190 align:middle line:84%
and now partial mu A mu,
partial mu, partial mu Ai

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:43.780 align:middle line:90%
now equal to partial phi, OK?

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:44.860 align:middle line:90%
We have these two.

00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:48.070 align:middle line:84%
So they're two equations
with J equal to 0--

00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and then become the
two equations, OK?

00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:53.670 align:middle line:90%


00:49:53.670 --> 00:50:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And also, we have
the gauge condition,

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.570 align:middle line:84%
which means that Ai
must be transverse, OK?

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:07.270 align:middle line:90%


00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.770 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So here are the equations
we have to satisfy.

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:13.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Here are the equations
we have to satisfy.

00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:18.580 align:middle line:90%


00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:25.220 align:middle line:84%
So here in this gauge, we
don't have this problem,

00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:29.250 align:middle line:84%
which is a constrained
quantization because phi is not

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:31.530 align:middle line:90%
a dynamic variable, OK?

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:35.520 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have to worry
about quantizing it, OK?

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, if you
look at this equation--

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.020 align:middle line:84%
so this is so-called
elliptic equation.

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And then you can impose
the boundary condition.

00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:46.020 align:middle line:84%
So if you require phi
to go to 0 at infinity--

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:48.150 align:middle line:84%
spatial infinity--
and then this equation

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:50.850 align:middle line:90%
only has identical 0 solution.

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:54.600 align:middle line:84%
So the phi-- you can
just set it to be 0.

00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:56.310 align:middle line:90%
So phi is just 0, OK?

00:50:56.310 --> 00:50:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And so now, since
the phi is just 0,

00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:03.060 align:middle line:84%
we don't have to worry
about this canonical--

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:03.630 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:05.190 align:middle line:84%
We just don't have
to quantize phi.

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:08.760 align:middle line:90%


00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And now, the equation for
Ai becomes very simple.

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:23.270 align:middle line:84%
You just have partial mu,
partial mu Ai equal to 0.

00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And now, this just becomes
massless scalar field equation.

00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:27.830 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:31.212 align:middle line:84%
This is just like you have a
massless scalar field equation.

00:51:31.212 --> 00:51:33.520 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.170 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can just proceed
with the quantization.

00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:36.670 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:41.180 align:middle line:84%
But remember-- Ai is
only transverse, OK?

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:43.370 align:middle line:90%
Ai has to be transverse.

00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:43.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:46.370 align:middle line:84%
So now, we impose this
as an operator equation.

00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So all this should be
interpreted as an operator

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.710 align:middle line:90%
equation when we quantize it.

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And so that means
that Ai as an operator

00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:58.850 align:middle line:84%
can only have a
transverse component.

00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:00.725 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can just
quantize the theory.

00:52:00.725 --> 00:52:06.130 align:middle line:90%


00:52:06.130 --> 00:52:06.630 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:10.440 align:middle line:84%
So the solution to this, of
course, we already know, OK?

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:14.080 align:middle line:84%
So we can just now proceed
with the quantization.

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.460 align:middle line:84%
So the first step
is that we have

00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:19.480 align:middle line:84%
to write down the canonical
commutation relation.

00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:28.750 align:middle line:84%
So this means that Ai with pi i,
pi j, should be i delta ij, OK?

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:32.010 align:middle line:90%
We have to impose this, OK?

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:34.530 align:middle line:84%
So this equation-- in
the current context,

00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:42.920 align:middle line:84%
if I write it carefully, it's
the Ai t xi t, x, and then

00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:48.500 align:middle line:90%
Ej t, x prime.

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:55.460 align:middle line:84%
So this should be equal to i
delta ij delta x minus x prime.

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:57.820 align:middle line:90%


00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:58.320 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:01.580 align:middle line:90%


00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:07.080 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So for me to
get to, to pick our gauge

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:09.490 align:middle line:84%
to start quantizing
the theory, is there

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:11.880 align:middle line:84%
a reason why we are using
the Coulomb gauge here?

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:15.185 align:middle line:84%
We discussed it
violates causality--

00:53:15.185 --> 00:53:16.060 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: No, no, no.

00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:17.830 align:middle line:84%
It does not violate
causality, right?

00:53:17.830 --> 00:53:21.720 align:middle line:90%
Just causality is not manifest.

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:23.490 align:middle line:90%
It does not violate causality.

00:53:23.490 --> 00:53:26.801 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: What does
that mean, not manifest?

00:53:26.801 --> 00:53:28.255 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: It means that the--

00:53:28.255 --> 00:53:33.150 align:middle line:90%


00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:36.300 align:middle line:84%
so manifest is at
every step, you

00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:38.800 align:middle line:90%
see the causality is preserved.

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And not manifest is that you
have to check it to make sure

00:53:43.310 --> 00:53:45.370 align:middle line:90%
causality is preserved.

00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:46.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:50.560 align:middle line:84%
So I say this
equation is covariant.

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:51.648 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to check it.

00:53:51.648 --> 00:53:52.690 align:middle line:90%
I know this is covariant.

00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:53.648 align:middle line:90%
I look at the equation.

00:53:53.648 --> 00:53:55.830 align:middle line:90%
It's covariant, OK?

00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:57.870 align:middle line:84%
But then if I look
at this theory,

00:53:57.870 --> 00:53:59.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
theory is covariant.

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:03.030 align:middle line:84%
But this theory is
actually covariant.

00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So the way to check
if it's covariant

00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:08.640 align:middle line:84%
is you check its
observable quantities.

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:09.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:11.150 align:middle line:84%
But phi is not
observable quantities.

00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:15.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we say it's
not manifestly causal.

00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:17.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:19.750 align:middle line:84%
So Coulomb gauge is
a convenient gauge

00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:22.720 align:middle line:84%
to use, even quantum
mechanically.

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:23.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:25.661 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So the
canonical momentum here

00:54:25.661 --> 00:54:28.845 align:middle line:84%
is not related to
the field momentum

00:54:28.845 --> 00:54:34.230 align:middle line:90%
E cross B, not related to--

00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:37.070 align:middle line:84%
we have the momentum carried
by the field E cross B?

00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:38.260 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: No, no, no, no.

00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:40.140 align:middle line:84%
No, it has nothing
to do with that.

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:40.640 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:44.150 align:middle line:84%
This is the canonical momentum
conjugated to the field.

00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And that momentum
you're talking about

00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:49.130 align:middle line:84%
is the momentum carried by
the electromagnetic field.

00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:51.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the spacetime
momentum carried

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:56.280 align:middle line:90%
by the electromagnetic field.

00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So that's the analog
of the Noether charge.

00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:02.080 align:middle line:84%
That momentum is the analog
of the Noether charge.

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:02.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.310 align:middle line:90%
For the scalar case, yeah.

00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:04.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:04.810 --> 00:55:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Remember-- in the scalar case,
there are also two momentums.

00:55:07.330 --> 00:55:07.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:10.910 align:middle line:90%


00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:13.320 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:14.648 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:55:14.648 --> 00:55:20.220 align:middle line:90%
So this is wrong, OK?

00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:22.680 align:middle line:84%
So if we just naively write
down this canonical commutation

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:25.320 align:middle line:84%
relation, this is wrong
because this equation

00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:38.210 align:middle line:84%
is incompatible with the
Lorentz gauge condition, OK?

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:46.850 align:middle line:90%


00:55:46.850 --> 00:55:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So imagine you just add
the derivative on this--

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:54.020 align:middle line:90%
to the derivative on x.

00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And then since this is operator
equation-- and then yeah.

00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:00.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:01.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:04.390 align:middle line:90%
So let me call this equation 1.

00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:12.050 align:middle line:84%
So if act partial i on 1,
then the left-hand side,

00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:24.620 align:middle line:90%
I have A t, x and Ej t, x prime.

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:29.430 align:middle line:84%
On the right-hand side, then
I have the delta function.

00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:33.710 align:middle line:90%
Let me just-- partial i delta.

00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:37.450 align:middle line:90%


00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:39.500 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And the right-hand
side is non-0.

00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:44.090 align:middle line:84%
It's just a derivative
of the delta function.

00:56:44.090 --> 00:56:46.010 align:middle line:84%
But the left-hand side,
according to this,

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:47.750 align:middle line:90%
should be 0, OK?

00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:49.457 align:middle line:90%
So we have a contradiction.

00:56:49.457 --> 00:56:55.660 align:middle line:90%


00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:56.920 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:00.720 align:middle line:84%
So this equation
cannot be right.

00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:02.460 align:middle line:90%
And the reason is simple.

00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:05.970 align:middle line:84%
It's because this
equation also includes

00:57:05.970 --> 00:57:08.670 align:middle line:84%
the longitudinal
degrees freedom.

00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:11.970 align:middle line:84%
But we said-- Ai can
only be transverse.

00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:15.165 align:middle line:84%
But this equation actually
is three components.

00:57:15.165 --> 00:57:18.600 align:middle line:84%
It also included
the longitudinal.

00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:21.300 align:middle line:84%
So we should not
include that, OK?

00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:23.715 align:middle line:90%
So what we should do--

00:57:23.715 --> 00:57:28.090 align:middle line:90%


00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:33.815 align:middle line:84%
we should only look
at the Ai T, OK?

00:57:33.815 --> 00:58:03.380 align:middle line:90%


00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:12.170 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, we should
look at Ai T t, x

00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:14.400 align:middle line:84%
and its conjugate
momentum, which

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:19.940 align:middle line:90%
is called pi j T t, x prime.

00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:32.470 align:middle line:84%
So this should be i delta ij
delta 3 x minus x prime, OK?

00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:38.840 align:middle line:84%
So we should look at only
the transverse component, OK?

00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:40.246 align:middle line:90%
And the pi i--

00:58:40.246 --> 00:58:44.940 align:middle line:90%


00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:47.970 align:middle line:84%
the conjugate momentum
for the transpose--

00:58:47.970 --> 00:58:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Ai-- if you start from here, so
you convince yourself from here

00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:57.970 align:middle line:84%
you can find it
from yourself, OK?

00:58:57.970 --> 00:59:02.030 align:middle line:84%
This is just equal to
partial 0 Ai T, OK?

00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Just partial 0 Ai T,
just the time derivative.

00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:11.920 align:middle line:84%
So remember-- here Ei
is equal to partial 0 Ai

00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:13.900 align:middle line:90%
minus partial iA 0.

00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And this part is 0
because phi is equal to 0.

00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And then here if you
take Ai to be transpose

00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and then pi transpose to--
yeah, equal do that, OK?

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:28.930 align:middle line:90%


00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:33.440 align:middle line:84%
But this equation
is still not correct

00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:36.620 align:middle line:84%
because the left-hand
side is transverse,

00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:39.350 align:middle line:84%
but the right-hand side
is not transverse, OK?

00:59:39.350 --> 00:59:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So here we have to impose
a transverse projector.

00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:48.220 align:middle line:84%
So rather than write it as
delta ij, what I should do

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:50.440 align:middle line:84%
is I write it as a
transverse projector.

00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:53.080 align:middle line:90%


00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:53.920 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:59.140 align:middle line:84%
So Pij is that when
you act the Ai T--

00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:09.340 align:middle line:84%
so Pij is if you act this on Aj,
it projects into the Ai T. OK?

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:11.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
transverse projector.

01:00:11.830 --> 01:00:21.410 align:middle line:90%


01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:23.340 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And then now, this is a
consistent equation, OK?

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a
consistent equation.

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:30.940 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:32.620 align:middle line:84%
So this transverse
projector, you

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:35.560 align:middle line:84%
can easily write down
in momentum space.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.960 align:middle line:84%
But in coordinate
space, it's a little bit

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.520 align:middle line:90%
awkward to write it down.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.410 align:middle line:84%
So formally, in
coordinate space,

01:00:41.410 --> 01:00:46.720 align:middle line:84%
this Pi jT can be
written as following--

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:55.582 align:middle line:84%
as delta ij minus partial i
partial j divided by delta

01:00:55.582 --> 01:00:56.082 align:middle line:90%
squared.

01:00:56.082 --> 01:01:01.010 align:middle line:90%


01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:03.160 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And so you can easily understand
the meaning of this equation

01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:12.740 align:middle line:90%
because when you act on the--

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:14.360 align:middle line:90%
yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.680 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, you can check yourself.

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.660 align:middle line:90%
This works, OK?

01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:20.840 align:middle line:90%
And to understand what this--

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.630 align:middle line:90%
you can check formally yourself.

01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:24.440 align:middle line:90%
This works, OK?

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.300 align:middle line:90%
Give you to the transpose.

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:31.180 align:middle line:84%
You can understand this equation
by going to momentum space.

01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:34.270 align:middle line:84%
You're going to momentum--
this just becomes ki, this kj.

01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:36.520 align:middle line:90%
This just becomes k squared, OK?

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:40.360 align:middle line:84%
This is just ki times kj
divided by k squared, OK?

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And so the coordinate
space definition of this

01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:45.250 align:middle line:84%
is just corresponding
to the Fourier

01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:49.510 align:middle line:84%
transform of the momentum
space expression, OK?

01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Just formally write
it as this, OK?

01:01:52.090 --> 01:01:54.920 align:middle line:90%
Just formally write like this.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:58.150 align:middle line:90%
Are there any questions on this?

01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:03.624 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So we don't really
understand the operation of 1

01:02:03.624 --> 01:02:04.760 align:middle line:90%
over del squared.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:07.722 align:middle line:84%
We just say this is the
coordinate space representation

01:02:07.722 --> 01:02:09.525 align:middle line:90%
of the momentum space?

01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:10.150 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:11.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:15.400 align:middle line:90%
We just use this to denote--

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:18.040 align:middle line:84%
use notation to
denote what we mean

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:21.410 align:middle line:84%
by the Fourier transform of
the momentum space expression.

01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:21.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:22.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:02:22.690 --> 01:02:24.850 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Do you mean the
inverse of the Laplacian

01:02:24.850 --> 01:02:28.437 align:middle line:84%
when you write 1
over grad squared?

01:02:28.437 --> 01:02:29.020 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Huh?

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:30.750 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Do you mean the
inverse of the Laplacian

01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:32.317 align:middle line:84%
when you write
something something

01:02:32.317 --> 01:02:33.690 align:middle line:90%
something over grad squared?

01:02:33.690 --> 01:02:34.800 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this is just
formal notation to make--

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:40.470 align:middle line:90%
once you can check--

01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:43.750 align:middle line:84%
say, if you have something like
this partial i Aj partial--

01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:44.250 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:49.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is a longitudinal
part of A. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:49.110 --> 01:02:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So one thing you
can check yourself

01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:57.360 align:middle line:84%
is, say, if you act this on the
partial j Ai, partial j Ai--

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.720 align:middle line:84%
and then this will cancel
with the downstairs.

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And then that gives you
the transverse part.

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:05.520 align:middle line:90%


01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:06.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, just try to treat
this as a notation, OK?

01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:15.770 align:middle line:84%
So momentum space is
very easy to understand.

01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:16.270 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:22.390 align:middle line:84%
So this is now our canonical
commutation relation.

01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And now, we only quantize the
physical degrees freedom, OK?

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:31.120 align:middle line:84%
We only quantize the
transverse degrees freedom.

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And everything else-- we
don't worry about it, OK?

01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Everything else-- we
don't worry about it.

01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:40.210 align:middle line:84%
And the transverse part just
satisfies the standard massless

01:03:40.210 --> 01:03:41.380 align:middle line:90%
equation of motion, OK?

01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:44.320 align:middle line:84%
So remember-- the
transverse part just

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.720 align:middle line:84%
satisfies the standard
equation of motion.

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.660 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can just
immediately write down

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:56.110 align:middle line:84%
the most general
expansion of Ai T. We just

01:03:56.110 --> 01:04:00.050 align:middle line:84%
write down the most general
theory that satisfies this--

01:04:00.050 --> 01:04:00.550 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:04.000 align:middle line:84%
This is just like a
massless equation.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.540 align:middle line:84%
So we can just write
what we do previously.

01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:17.510 align:middle line:90%


01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:18.760 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And then we can
just write down--

01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:36.980 align:middle line:84%
so previously, we just say ak i
k x plus ak dagger minus i k x.

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And the omega k in this case
would be just equal to k, OK?

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:44.480 align:middle line:90%
Be good for massless.

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:47.720 align:middle line:90%


01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:52.160 align:middle line:84%
But now, here we have two
independent components, OK?

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:54.360 align:middle line:84%
So we have two
independent components.

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:56.030 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, we
have two, actually,

01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:58.430 align:middle line:90%
independent solutions, OK?

01:04:58.430 --> 01:05:01.760 align:middle line:84%
So now, let me parameterize
the two independent solutions

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:04.670 align:middle line:84%
by a polarization vector--
to write more generally

01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:08.270 align:middle line:84%
by polarization
vector like this.

01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:14.470 align:middle line:84%
r equal to 1 to 2
epsilon i r, OK?

01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:17.180 align:middle line:90%
And then this is r.

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:20.190 align:middle line:90%
This is r.

01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:20.690 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:22.490 align:middle line:90%
So epsilon r--

01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:33.080 align:middle line:90%


01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:51.510 align:middle line:84%
1 to 2 are the basis of
transverse vectors, OK?

01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Because Ai has to
be transverse, OK?

01:05:55.650 --> 01:06:01.180 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, you can
treat it as polarization

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:05.280 align:middle line:90%
associated with this ak, OK?

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:15.360 align:middle line:84%
So by definition, this should
satisfy, say, ir ki equal to 0.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:18.290 align:middle line:84%
So this should be
transverse, OK?

01:06:18.290 --> 01:06:20.960 align:middle line:84%
So we also define them to
be orthogonal to each other.

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:27.220 align:middle line:90%


01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:31.860 align:middle line:84%
So r and s here
are just 1 2, OK?

01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:34.860 align:middle line:84%
So this is orthogonality
normal to each other.

01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:38.986 align:middle line:90%


01:06:38.986 --> 01:06:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Orthogonal, OK?

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And so they also
satisfy the condition.

01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you have two
independent vectors,

01:06:54.830 --> 01:07:01.400 align:middle line:84%
then when you sum them
together, then you

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:05.160 align:middle line:84%
should get the
projection operator, OK?

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:10.485 align:middle line:84%
So you should get
the Pij T k, OK?

01:07:10.485 --> 01:07:13.130 align:middle line:90%


01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:18.230 align:middle line:84%
So epsilon i-- they
are k dependent.

01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:19.790 align:middle line:84%
They depend on the
spatial momentum

01:07:19.790 --> 01:07:21.760 align:middle line:84%
because they have to be
orthogonal to the momentum.

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:22.260 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is just the momentum
space version of this.

01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:27.440 align:middle line:90%
This is the delta ij.

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:30.410 align:middle line:90%


01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:35.850 align:middle line:90%
ki kj squared, OK?

01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:37.860 align:middle line:90%
So this is orthogonal condition.

01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:39.630 align:middle line:84%
This is a completeness
condition.

01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:44.870 align:middle line:90%


01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:47.360 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:48.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a completeness condition.

01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:52.360 align:middle line:90%


01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

01:07:55.630 --> 01:08:03.680 align:middle line:84%
So now, this is the
expansion for Ai, OK?

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:12.620 align:middle line:90%


01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:16.620 align:middle line:84%
So the only difference
from the scalar case--

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:19.920 align:middle line:84%
is that now, here you have
two independent vectors.

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And now, we have allowed
the general polarization

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:26.590 align:middle line:90%
associated with the--

01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:28.060 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Have parameterized
the general solution

01:08:30.310 --> 01:08:34.120 align:middle line:84%
using two independent
polarization vectors, OK?

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:39.510 align:middle line:90%


01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:49.229 align:middle line:84%
So now, you can now plug
this back into here.

01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can find the
commutation relation between

01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:52.679 align:middle line:90%
and A and A dagger.

01:08:52.679 --> 01:08:56.859 align:middle line:90%


01:08:56.859 --> 01:09:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Then you find, as
you would expect,

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:08.640 align:middle line:90%
that they satisfy the standard.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:14.410 align:middle line:84%
So from the
commutation relation,

01:09:14.410 --> 01:09:23.979 align:middle line:84%
we find that the akr
and ak prime s dagger

01:09:23.979 --> 01:09:26.619 align:middle line:90%
is equal to delta rs.

01:09:26.619 --> 01:09:34.955 align:middle line:90%


01:09:34.955 --> 01:09:35.455 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:09:35.455 --> 01:09:52.490 align:middle line:90%


01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:55.280 align:middle line:90%
With the rest 0, OK?

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:58.010 align:middle line:90%
So r and s equal to 1 2.

01:09:58.010 --> 01:09:59.615 align:middle line:90%
And the others are 0.

01:09:59.615 --> 01:10:07.230 align:middle line:90%


01:10:07.230 --> 01:10:07.730 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:10:07.730 --> 01:10:11.360 align:middle line:90%


01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:11.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:15.520 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can write
down the Hilbert space.

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:18.700 align:middle line:84%
We obtain the Hilbert space
again just from what we do.

01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So we specify a vacuum
requiring this-- just ar k

01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:38.440 align:middle line:84%
annihilate the vacuum for
any k and r equal to 1 and 2.

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And then the single
particle state

01:10:51.430 --> 01:11:00.130 align:middle line:84%
is given by just ak r and
the dagger acting on 0.

01:11:00.130 --> 01:11:09.010 align:middle line:84%
So we denoted this as
k and epsilon r, OK?

01:11:09.010 --> 01:11:17.260 align:middle line:84%
So this describes a
single photon state.

01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:29.170 align:middle line:90%


01:11:29.170 --> 01:11:44.070 align:middle line:84%
This polarization vector
given by epsilon r, OK?

01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:48.810 align:middle line:84%
So remember-- epsilon r is
the transverse vector, OK?

01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And you have two
independent of them.

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:51.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:11:51.630 --> 01:11:54.065 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Should there
be some normalization,

01:11:54.065 --> 01:11:58.940 align:middle line:90%
like square root 2 [INAUDIBLE]?

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:00.460 align:middle line:90%
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:01.240 align:middle line:90%
I believe so.

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:01.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Let me just put the
proportionality.

01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:06.550 align:middle line:90%
Right, yeah.

01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:07.360 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:12.220 align:middle line:90%


01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:13.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:14.860 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:17.620 align:middle line:84%
So that concludes the story
for quantization in the Coulomb

01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:18.730 align:middle line:90%
gauge.

01:12:18.730 --> 01:12:30.470 align:middle line:84%
So just to summarize,
for the Coulomb gauge

01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:35.930 align:middle line:84%
so the Coulomb gauge is
conceptually pretty simple, OK?

01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:38.240 align:middle line:84%
So the advantage of
the Coulomb gauge--

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:43.630 align:middle line:90%


01:12:43.630 --> 01:12:54.290 align:middle line:84%
we said we can just directly
quantize physical degrees

01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:57.135 align:middle line:90%
of freedom, OK?

01:12:57.135 --> 01:12:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Because the unphysical
degrees freedom,

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:02.270 align:middle line:84%
phi, just automatically
is equal to 0.

01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And then the
longitudinal part, we

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:07.490 align:middle line:84%
can just throw away by hand
using the Coulomb gauge

01:13:07.490 --> 01:13:10.160 align:middle line:84%
by promoting the Coulomb gauge
condition as the operator

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:10.880 align:middle line:90%
equation.

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we can just
solve it by hand.

01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And then we just have
the transverse part.

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And then once you have
the transverse part,

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:25.475 align:middle line:84%
you can just quantize it then
as a free massless field, OK?

01:13:25.475 --> 01:13:29.720 align:middle line:90%


01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:37.980 align:middle line:84%
But the drawback, of
course, is always not

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:40.980 align:middle line:90%
manifest Lorentz invariant, OK?

01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:43.620 align:middle line:90%
Not manifest Lorentz covariance.

01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:52.130 align:middle line:90%


01:13:52.130 --> 01:13:52.630 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:57.870 align:middle line:90%


01:13:57.870 --> 01:13:58.905 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

01:13:58.905 --> 01:14:08.950 align:middle line:90%


01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:09.450 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:14:09.450 --> 01:14:12.860 align:middle line:90%


01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:15.650 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's look
at the Lorentz gauge.

01:14:15.650 --> 01:14:20.420 align:middle line:90%


01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So these two are the most
commonly used gauges.

01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And also, these are two
representatives, OK?

01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:31.610 align:middle line:84%
They're two
representative gauges

01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:34.670 align:middle line:84%
because by quantizing
them, they're

01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:37.640 align:middle line:84%
involving completely
different procedures.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And by contrasting what's
happening in the Lorentz

01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:45.020 align:middle line:90%
gauge--

01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and what's happening in
the Lorentz gauge actually

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.800 align:middle line:90%
will be very instructive, OK?

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:53.400 align:middle line:84%
So we will just consider
these two cases.

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.445 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's move on
to the Lorentz gauge.

01:14:55.445 --> 01:15:16.650 align:middle line:90%


01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:23.610 align:middle line:84%
So in the Lorentz
gauge, we will use

01:15:23.610 --> 01:15:34.680 align:middle line:84%
a somewhat different strategy
because in the Lorentz gauge--

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:39.270 align:middle line:84%
so first is that solving
the gauge condition

01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:42.000 align:middle line:90%
becomes more difficult, OK?

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And also, in the
Lorentz gauge, there

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.250 align:middle line:90%
is a residual gauge freedom, OK?

01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:52.580 align:middle line:90%
So there are two things.

01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So in the Lorentz
gauge, instead, we

01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:58.300 align:middle line:90%
will start with this action.

01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:00.790 align:middle line:84%
So we will start
with this action.

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:11.440 align:middle line:90%


01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:15.660 align:middle line:84%
We will start with
this action, which

01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:20.910 align:middle line:84%
we say classically can be used
to fix the Lorentz gauge, OK?

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:23.630 align:middle line:90%


01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And when psi is equal
to 1, so this just

01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:34.700 align:middle line:84%
becomes partial mu A nu
and partial mu A nu, OK?

01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:36.440 align:middle line:90%
So this is for xi to 1.

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:41.200 align:middle line:90%


01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So you say, this theory--
we know how to quantize.

01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:51.400 align:middle line:84%
These are just four decoupled
massless scalar fields, OK?

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:55.150 align:middle line:84%
For psi equal to 1, it's
particularly simple.

01:16:55.150 --> 01:16:56.035 align:middle line:90%
We just have four--

01:16:56.035 --> 01:16:58.775 align:middle line:90%


01:16:58.775 --> 01:16:59.275 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

01:16:59.275 --> 01:17:02.520 align:middle line:90%


01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Oh, by the way, I
should mention--

01:17:05.970 --> 01:17:10.650 align:middle line:84%
once you have that form, and
once you have this commutation

01:17:10.650 --> 01:17:12.930 align:middle line:84%
relation, and once you
have this relation,

01:17:12.930 --> 01:17:17.190 align:middle line:84%
you can find any correlation
functions of A, OK?

01:17:17.190 --> 01:17:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Two point functions--
propagator,

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Feynman propagator,
retarded propagator.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.230 align:middle line:84%
You can find all
of them explicitly.

01:17:22.230 --> 01:17:25.310 align:middle line:90%


01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:29.240 align:middle line:84%
So now, this theory
seems to be very simple.

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:33.170 align:middle line:84%
This just decoupled four
massive scalar fields, OK?

01:17:33.170 --> 01:17:35.570 align:middle line:84%
So we can just
straightforwardly write down

01:17:35.570 --> 01:17:37.670 align:middle line:90%
its canonical momentum.

01:17:37.670 --> 01:17:49.520 align:middle line:84%
So pi nu-- this is just
equal to A nu star, A nu dot.

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:51.570 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:17:51.570 --> 01:17:56.610 align:middle line:90%
And the Hamiltonian density--

01:17:56.610 --> 01:18:04.320 align:middle line:84%
just given by 1/2 A
nu dot A nu dot plus--

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:11.040 align:middle line:84%
just like you have 4 independent
massive scalar fields

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:18.640 align:middle line:84%
with the equation of motion
given by this partial square A

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:23.180 align:middle line:90%
nu equal to 0, OK?

01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:27.360 align:middle line:84%
So now, you can just
completely take over, OK?

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:31.400 align:middle line:84%
We can just completely
take over what we did

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:34.850 align:middle line:90%
for the massless scalar, OK?

01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:36.860 align:middle line:84%
To write down the
answer for the massless

01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:39.660 align:middle line:84%
scalar-- but we're
running out of time today.

01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So next time, we
will talk about--

01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:51.380 align:middle line:84%
so now, you can just treat
it as four massless scalar.

01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:55.600 align:middle line:90%
But then we have a problem, OK?

01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Because we just need
the Coulomb gauge.

01:19:00.670 --> 01:19:02.920 align:middle line:84%
We only have two
physical degrees freedom.

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:05.320 align:middle line:90%
But here we have four, OK?

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:09.160 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, we have
to get rid of two, OK?

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And then we will find the ways
to get rid of the two, OK?

01:19:12.910 --> 01:19:13.570 align:middle line:90%
OK, yeah.

01:19:13.570 --> 01:19:17.070 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, let's stop
here for today.

01:19:17.070 --> 01:19:20.000 align:middle line:90%
