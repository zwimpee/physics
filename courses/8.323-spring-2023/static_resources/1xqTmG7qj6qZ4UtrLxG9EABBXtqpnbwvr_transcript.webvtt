00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.470 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.380 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Let us start.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.530 align:middle line:84%
So last time, we started talking
about the following process.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.380 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:90%
So you consider e plus e minus--

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.190 align:middle line:84%
so the electron, the positron
they scatter and then they

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.110 align:middle line:84%
will annihilate and that
creates some other particles.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.890 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.460 align:middle line:84%
So b and the b bar--
some final particles

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.830 align:middle line:84%
can be different
kinds of things.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.500 align:middle line:84%
So if we draw the
Feynman diagram

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.285 align:middle line:84%
with the time going up,
and then the process

00:00:54.285 --> 00:00:55.410 align:middle line:90%
will be like the following.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.760 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.020 align:middle line:90%
So the initial particle--

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.700 align:middle line:84%
so this is the e minus
and this is e plus.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And then we have b
and the b bar, OK?

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.090 align:middle line:90%
So we can--

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.900 align:middle line:84%
So such a process is a very
important discovery machine

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.530 align:middle line:90%
for new particles, OK?

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Very important for
discovering new particles.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.180 align:middle line:84%
So let me just mention
two examples here.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.310 align:middle line:90%
So in 1974 to 1976 at SLAC--

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.900 align:middle line:84%
so SLAC is called Stanford
Linear Acceleration Center.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.580 align:middle line:84%
So they have an electron
positron collider.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And so there they first
discovered the tau particle.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.370 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.530 align:middle line:90%
And this tau particle--

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.710 align:middle line:90%
it's mass is the 1.8 GeV.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:27.200 align:middle line:84%
So when your total energy is
greater than twice the 1.8 GeV,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.100 align:middle line:84%
then you can, in principle,
pair create this tau part--

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.070 align:middle line:90%
tau plus and tau minus.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And another example is in
1974, again, at the SLAC.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And the e plus, e
minus goes to c, c bar.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:90%
So c is the charm quark here.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.590 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's the charm quark here.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.515 align:middle line:84%
So what they observed is
the bound state of the c,

00:02:57.515 --> 00:03:00.240 align:middle line:90%
c bar-- call it J/psi.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.630 align:middle line:84%
So under the mass of the
J/psi, it's about 3.1 GeV.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.430 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.790 align:middle line:90%
3.1 GeV.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.850 align:middle line:84%
So this J/psi-- so this particle
was discovered at the same time

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.710 align:middle line:84%
at Brookhaven
through the proton--

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.100 align:middle line:84%
through the collision of the
protons by our own colleague

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Samuel Ting.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And then they both get the
Nobel Prize in 1975, I think.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So there was actually
a funny story regarding

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.870 align:middle line:90%
the discovery of this particle.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So at Brookhaven, they
collide the protons

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.160 align:middle line:90%
on the fixed target.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So that is a much
messier machine,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.240 align:middle line:84%
because protons contain
lots of quarks and gluons

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:05.080 align:middle line:84%
and so it's with
strong interactions.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you collide
high enough energy,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:90%
you can create any particles.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.190 align:middle line:84%
But since it's involving
strong interactions,

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and strong interactions
have many, many particles.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.840 align:middle line:84%
So the so the collider at
Brookhaven is very, very messy.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.930 align:middle line:84%
So in order to find
the new particles,

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.560 align:middle line:90%
it's very, very difficult.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.940 align:middle line:84%
But they managed to find this
new particle at Brookhaven.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:38.180 align:middle line:84%
But Samuel Ting was famously
extraordinarily meticulous.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, so he wanted to
be absolutely right,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.050 align:middle line:90%
so he was checking and checking.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.670 align:middle line:90%
So during one of the--

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so this is a rumor.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.870 align:middle line:84%
So the rumor said that during
one of the checking process--

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.220 align:middle line:84%
and somehow the
rumor spread that he

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.770 align:middle line:90%
discovered a new particle.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And so the person was doing
the experiment at SLAC

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.690 align:middle line:90%
and called him up.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Even the rumor--
the rumor even--

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so the news leaked.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.350 align:middle line:84%
It even leaked the energy scale
of the particle they found.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And then the person
was doing the register

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.200 align:middle line:84%
at the SLAC then
called the Samuel Ting.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.080 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, I heard you
have found a new particle.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.590 align:middle line:90%
Samuel Ting said, no, I didn't.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.650 align:middle line:90%
He didn't want to have the--

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, actually it's not very
good, because I'm recorded.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.050 align:middle line:90%


00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm recorded.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.920 align:middle line:84%
So I think this maybe it's
not a good spread rumors.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.120 align:middle line:84%
If it's not recorded,
actually, I can tell the story.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Anyway so accordingly,
then the register

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.360 align:middle line:84%
said then, oh, you
didn't find the particle.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.010 align:middle line:90%
Then I can discover it.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Because they already
knew the energy scale.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.930 align:middle line:84%
They already had
the energy scale.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very,
very clean machine.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.120 align:middle line:84%
So electron, positron, when they
collide only energy created.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So it don't create
a lot of junks.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you add the right
energy, you can immediately

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.720 align:middle line:90%
find the new particle.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.350 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to do much work.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And so they put the machine
at that energy, immediately,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:90%
the new particle was discovered.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.830 align:middle line:90%
And so they were--

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:30.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.360 align:middle line:84%
So they were awarded
the Nobel Prize jointly.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.170 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:40.610 align:middle line:84%
So this was an
important discovery,

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.420 align:middle line:84%
because before that, people
didn't believe quarks exist,

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.630 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.250 align:middle line:84%
People didn't quite
believe the quark

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.850 align:middle line:84%
existed, even though there
are many models, et cetera.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And there are lots
of other evidences.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.760 align:middle line:90%
But this was the first--

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.230 align:middle line:84%
yeah, because C-quark
is very heavy.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And so c and c bar, they
bound not very strongly.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
first direct evidence

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.340 align:middle line:90%
actually quark existed.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And so this actually
shocked the community.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.410 align:middle line:84%
So this was
discovered in October.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.320 align:middle line:84%
So they call it the
October Revolution.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.260 align:middle line:90%


00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.930 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it played a very
important role for people

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:33.040 align:middle line:84%
to accept the
existence of quarks.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.880 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:40.890 align:middle line:84%
So in particular, by looking
at the more general process--

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:44.480 align:middle line:90%
so this goes to hadrons.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.960 align:middle line:90%
OK, you just collide them.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.000 align:middle line:90%
And then you look at it.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.960 align:middle line:90%
It's going to hadrons.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:57.190 align:middle line:84%
You can actually show that
the quarks have three colors.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:06.050 align:middle line:90%


00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:06.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.290 align:middle line:84%
You can show quark
have three colors.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, so we
will see that, OK?

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So before doing that, let's
first have to do a calculation,

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:20.830 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.350 align:middle line:84%
So we have to calculate
this explicitly.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.850 align:middle line:90%
Let me see.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.440 align:middle line:90%
I get my page a little bit.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.980 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:32.710 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:33.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so first we have
to do a calculation.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.740 align:middle line:84%
We have to calculate
this process, OK?

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.500 align:middle line:84%
So after we have
calculated this,

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.270 align:middle line:84%
then it's obvious how
this can tell us why

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:46.740 align:middle line:90%
the quark have three colors.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:48.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.733 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So since you only see
the bound state of the quarks,

00:08:50.733 --> 00:08:54.950 align:middle line:84%
how can you know for sure
that they are a bound state?

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.300 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so indeed.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, for
many years, if you

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.450 align:middle line:84%
look at the proton,
neutron, and the pion,

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.260 align:middle line:90%
they're very tightly bound.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And so even though
there were models

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.240 align:middle line:90%
about the quarks inside there--

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.150 align:middle line:90%
so it's not quite--

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.690 align:middle line:84%
yeah, but in the c
case, c are very heavy.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And so they form a
weakly bound state.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And so in the sense that
you're looking at the--

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.380 align:middle line:90%
yeah, so here, it's--

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.960 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, you can
look at the C-quark,

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.104 align:middle line:84%
because it's a very weakly bound
state of the c and C-quark.

00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:34.920 align:middle line:90%


00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.610 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:36.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.240 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Does weakly bound
imply it's usually larger?

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.890 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Weakly bound just say
you can probe with the--

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you can essentially--

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.720 align:middle line:84%
you can probe the internal
structure much easier.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:55.666 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.666 --> 00:09:59.890 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: If electron collider
is much cleaner than Hadron

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Collider, then why is like the
most important machine right

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.440 align:middle line:90%
now is the Hadron Collider?

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.700 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:11.890 align:middle line:84%
That's good, because electron
collider is more difficult,

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.540 align:middle line:84%
because you have to
build a straight line,

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and because the electron have
a much stronger synchrotron

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.400 align:middle line:84%
radiation if they're
moving in the circle.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And so that loses
a lot of energy.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.802 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
electron collider.

00:10:26.802 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:84%
They should build a
strong straight line.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.120 align:middle line:84%
But straight line you cannot
have very high energy,

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.050 align:middle line:90%
require very long distance.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
a lot of people

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.750 align:middle line:84%
built the proton
collider, which is easier.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it's easier
to get higher energy.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:49.330 align:middle line:84%
But the next generation of the
accelerator of the LHC, people

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:53.210 align:middle line:84%
are talking about building
an electron collider again.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:53.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.240 align:middle line:90%


00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.020 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.210 align:middle line:84%
So now let's try
to calculate this.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.920 align:middle line:84%
So essentially we need to
calculate this diagram.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, this
diagram is very easy.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.350 align:middle line:84%
We need to calculate the cross
section corresponding to this.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:13.710 align:middle line:90%
So let me just label a label.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.230 align:middle line:90%
So this is e minus.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.030 align:middle line:90%
So this is e plus.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.020 align:middle line:90%
So this would be b.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.490 align:middle line:90%
And this will be b bar.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:90%
So let me label the momentum.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.700 align:middle line:90%
So here, let's take p1, r1.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And then this would
be p2, r2 bar.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So tell you this
is an antiparticle.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.950 align:middle line:90%
And so this one is k1, s1.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:45.020 align:middle line:90%
And this one is k2 s2 bar.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And so the amplitude for
this will be M. So the cross

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.610 align:middle line:90%
section.

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So now, suppose we consider
unpolarized process.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:02.315 align:middle line:84%
As we discussed last
time, the cross section --

00:12:02.315 --> 00:12:06.130 align:middle line:90%


00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:13.850 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so d sigma, d omega should
be proportional to the spin.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:19.090 align:middle line:84%
So we should sum over
all the final states--

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.370 align:middle line:84%
sum over the polarization
of the final states,

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.860 align:middle line:84%
because we don't measure
individual polarization.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:28.060 align:middle line:84%
But we also should average
over the polarization

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.730 align:middle line:90%
of the initial states.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:34.660 align:middle line:84%
So the result, as we discussed
at the end of last lecture,

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.060 align:middle line:84%
is that you need to
take one quarter, come

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:43.330 align:middle line:84%
from the average over the spin
of these two initial particles,

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and then, just sum of spins
of all the particles, OK?

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:56.890 align:middle line:90%


00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:57.490 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:02.610 align:middle line:90%
And right.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.510 align:middle line:84%
So that's the thing we
need to-- so let's just

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.860 align:middle line:90%
try to first compute the m.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:14.910 align:middle line:90%
So m is given by--

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.420 align:middle line:90%
OK, so we just follow our rule.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So you follow the
fermionic line, OK?

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.240 align:middle line:90%
So here there's a vertex.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.570 align:middle line:90%
So here there's a gamma.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:32.690 align:middle line:84%
So each vertex gives
you minus ie gamma mu.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:33.500 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So if you follow
this one, then we

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:52.830 align:middle line:84%
get v bar r2, p2, minus
ie gamma mu and ur1 p1.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So this is coming from
this fermionic line.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And from this fermionic
line, we start from here.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.160 align:middle line:90%
So this would be the u.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:07.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.740 align:middle line:90%
Also, we have this propagator.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Let me just write down the
propagator for the photon.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.490 align:middle line:84%
So let's take xi
equal to 1 gauge.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.580 align:middle line:90%


00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:24.220 align:middle line:84%
The Lorentz gauge
with xi equal to 1.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.640 align:middle line:90%
And then, lets follow this line.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So here, we should
have a vertex gamma nu.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:30.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And then we will have u bar s1
k1 minus ie gamma nu v s2 k2.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:51.800 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.090 align:middle line:90%
So this is the full amplitude.

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:90%
So this is a number.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:04.570 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is a number,
because this is a row vector.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:05.860 align:middle line:90%
This is a matrix.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is a column vector,
so this will be a number.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, this
will be a number.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:15.417 align:middle line:84%
And then the mu nu indices are
contracted with the propagator

00:15:15.417 --> 00:15:16.000 align:middle line:90%
of the photon.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.790 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:84%
So actually, if I
want to be precise,

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.090 align:middle line:84%
there's actually a
factor of i here.

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.550 align:middle line:84%
But this factor of i is
not important, because--

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.950 align:middle line:90%
and then the q--

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:35.210 align:middle line:84%
so the q is the momentum
of the photon here.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.630 align:middle line:84%
So the q should be the sum
of the initial momentum.

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:46.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, so q should be
equal to p1 plus p2.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And also this means that the q
square is equal to minus s, OK?

00:15:53.830 --> 00:16:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Remember s is defined to be the
minus p1 plus p2 square, OK?

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:05.580 align:middle line:84%
So now we can write this
amplitude using a shorthand

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.220 align:middle line:90%
notation.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.740 align:middle line:84%
So if I forget all this
momentum dependence,

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and then this is equal to minus
ie square divided by s, OK?

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:22.170 align:middle line:84%
If you cancel all the i's,
and then we have two terms--

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:36.485 align:middle line:84%
v bar r2 gamma nu and ur1 and
the u bar s1 gamma nu vs2.

00:16:36.485 --> 00:16:41.910 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:45.520 align:middle line:90%
And now we need to--

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.690 align:middle line:84%
then what we need to do is we
need to square it and sum over

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.310 align:middle line:90%
all the spin.

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And then we plug the
resulting expression

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.940 align:middle line:84%
into the formula we derived
for the cross section

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.280 align:middle line:90%
we derived last time, OK?

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.890 align:middle line:90%


00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:07.329 align:middle line:84%
So the whole calculation
is a little bit tedious.

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:08.980 align:middle line:84%
But I think we
should at least go

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.500 align:middle line:84%
through one such
calculation, because this

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:19.839 align:middle line:84%
is the kind of prime
example of QED calculation.

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:25.569 align:middle line:84%
So each of us should at least
see once in our life, OK?

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:27.535 align:middle line:84%
So we will do it
explicitly here.

00:17:27.535 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:90%


00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.920 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: The final
line needs metric.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.570 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: The final
line is a metric.

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:36.700 align:middle line:84%
You are right,
but I can do that,

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.290 align:middle line:90%
just put the gamma mu here.

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:41.460 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:45.000 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Do we to
keep the i epsilon?

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:45.960 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, also here, because the
q square is never equal to 0,

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.370 align:middle line:84%
so we don't need to
care about i epsilon.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:55.450 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:56.690 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:57.890 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.215 align:middle line:90%
So now let's do the square.

00:17:59.215 --> 00:18:01.735 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.735 --> 00:18:02.735 align:middle line:90%
Now let's to the square.

00:18:02.735 --> 00:18:05.390 align:middle line:90%


00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:09.790 align:middle line:84%
So square-- we just square this
term and square this term, OK?

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.365 align:middle line:90%
So when we square this term--

00:18:11.365 --> 00:18:15.650 align:middle line:90%


00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.230 align:middle line:90%
so we also square this term.

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.220 align:middle line:84%
So here, we just get the e
to the power 4 divided by s

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:21.910 align:middle line:90%
square.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And when we square this
term, we just get another--

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:31.270 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so this is
gamma nu gamma mu.

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:36.720 align:middle line:84%
So if we square it, then
we get another term.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.085 align:middle line:90%
So we just copy this term.

00:18:38.085 --> 00:18:41.530 align:middle line:90%


00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:42.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let me just copy here.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:50.300 align:middle line:90%


00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:56.930 align:middle line:84%
ur1-- Yeah, when we square it,
we get another copy of this.

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.260 align:middle line:90%
And so let me just write it.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.020 align:middle line:90%


00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:04.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, sorry.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.390 align:middle line:84%
So we take the
complex conjugate.

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So when we take the complex,
we need to take the modulus.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.650 align:middle line:84%
So that means we need
to multiply this,

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.130 align:middle line:90%
with its own complex conjugate.

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And the complex
conjugate of this

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:29.290 align:middle line:84%
is given by u bar r1,
then gamma nu and vr2,

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:35.820 align:middle line:84%
and then, times this one
and its complex conjugate.

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And so we have us1 bar gamma nu
vs2 and vs2 bar gamma nu us1.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:53.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:59.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is the original
copy with the nu contract

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.450 align:middle line:90%
with this nu.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is the complex
conjugate with this nu contract

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.455 align:middle line:90%
with this nu, OK?

00:20:04.455 --> 00:20:12.710 align:middle line:90%


00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:13.210 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:16.530 align:middle line:90%


00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:20.180 align:middle line:90%
So this looks like a mess.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:23.830 align:middle line:90%
OK, this look like a big mess.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
actually, there's

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.080 align:middle line:84%
a series of beautiful
tricks we can use

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.240 align:middle line:90%
to calculate this quantity, OK?

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So naively, you say, oh
to calculate this thing,

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:38.020 align:middle line:84%
I have to plug-in
the individual wave

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:43.480 align:middle line:84%
functions for this v and u, et
cetera we worked out before.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.120 align:middle line:84%
But fortunately, actually,
we don't need to do it, OK?

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually go
through a series of tricks.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.860 align:middle line:90%
And then we don't have to do it.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:52.945 align:middle line:90%
So the first trick--

00:20:52.945 --> 00:20:55.610 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:59.920 align:middle line:90%
you say this is a number, OK?

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:07.260 align:middle line:84%
Since this is a number, I can
put a trace outside of it,

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:11.670 align:middle line:84%
because the trace of a
number is just a number.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:14.110 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And now you remember the trace
have this cyclic properties,

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.570 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:20.950 align:middle line:90%
Trace have the cyclic property.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:24.740 align:middle line:84%
So I can actually move
this to there, OK?

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.660 align:middle line:90%
So I can move it.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:31.400 align:middle line:84%
So now I can write it
as e to the 4 s square.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.000 align:middle line:90%


00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.070 align:middle line:84%
I can just move this to there
so that the two come together.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:48.320 align:middle line:84%
So we have vr2, v bar
r2, gamma mu, and ur1.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:54.200 align:middle line:90%
u bar r1 times trace.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:22:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, I put this us to
the other side, us1, u bar s1,

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.420 align:middle line:90%
gamma nu.

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:08.665 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, I missed the gamma nu.

00:22:08.665 --> 00:22:14.900 align:middle line:90%


00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, did I-- so I
put this-- oh, sorry.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.340 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.980 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, I just missed that one.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.710 align:middle line:90%
u bar, r1, gamma nu.

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:27.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, with that, so
I have u bar s 1 gamma mu.

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:41.045 align:middle line:84%
And then we have vs2,
v bar s2, and gamma nu.

00:22:41.045 --> 00:22:41.545 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:22:41.545 --> 00:22:46.330 align:middle line:90%


00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.090 align:middle line:90%
So I get that.

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:50.550 align:middle line:90%
So the reason I do that--

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.140 align:middle line:90%


00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.170 align:middle line:84%
so now, in this form,
now this is a matrix.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:57.760 align:middle line:90%
OK, now this is--

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.680 align:middle line:90%
now this is a column.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.450 align:middle line:90%
This is a row.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:02.745 align:middle line:90%
And this is a matrix.

00:23:02.745 --> 00:23:03.620 align:middle line:90%
And this is a column.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:04.370 align:middle line:90%
And this is a row.

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:07.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is a matrix times
a matrix and times a matrix

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.010 align:middle line:90%
and times a matrix, OK?

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you take the trace and
then you get the number, OK--

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:13.900 align:middle line:84%
similarly with
things since here.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.560 align:middle line:90%


00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And then we need to sum
over all the spins, OK?

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we need
to actually-- when

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:84%
we sum all the
spins, it means we

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:31.820 align:middle line:84%
sum over all possible with some
order, r2, r1, s1, and s2, OK?

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:36.290 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can use a
trick which we had when

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.180 align:middle line:90%
we discussed the Dirac spinors.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.080 align:middle line:90%
OK, so now, recall--

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:43.630 align:middle line:90%


00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:50.680 align:middle line:84%
now, recall for on-shell
spinors means they both satisfy

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.540 align:middle line:90%
the equation of motion, OK?

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:57.670 align:middle line:90%
Those all the eigenspinors, OK?

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:00.730 align:middle line:84%
They satisfy the
following, sum over r--

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:04.780 align:middle line:84%
if you sum over all
the r of the u, urp--

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:09.270 align:middle line:90%


00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:19.410 align:middle line:84%
ur bar p-- that give you
i, ip slash plus m, OK?

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:37.342 align:middle line:84%
And when you sum over v, you get
minus i, minus ik slash plus m.

00:24:37.342 --> 00:24:37.842 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:37.842 --> 00:24:41.460 align:middle line:90%


00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.890 align:middle line:90%
So now, we see we have--

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:48.630 align:middle line:84%
if we sum over spin, then
we have these combinations.

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Now, we can use those formulas.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.780 align:middle line:90%
Now, we can use those formulas.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:25:01.740 align:middle line:84%
So now we find one quarter when
we sum over all the indices,

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:09.420 align:middle line:90%
r1, r2, s1, s2, the m square--

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:17.650 align:middle line:90%


00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:23.550 align:middle line:84%
so we get e4 divided
by 4 s squared.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And then we just apply
those formulas into here.

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:38.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we get trace
minus ip2 slash plus m.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.100 align:middle line:90%


00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:45.330 align:middle line:84%
So m is the mass of
the initial particle.

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And I take the m prime of the
mass of the final particle.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:55.650 align:middle line:84%
So the e plus minus
of mass m and b,

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:59.550 align:middle line:90%
b bar have mass m prime, OK?

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:05.500 align:middle line:90%


00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:11.685 align:middle line:84%
So then I have this, then this
times, then this gamma mu.

00:26:11.685 --> 00:26:14.450 align:middle line:90%


00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this is still
inside this bracket.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:20.220 align:middle line:90%


00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:24.135 align:middle line:90%
ip1 slash plus m, gamma nu.

00:26:24.135 --> 00:26:26.810 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I have trace ik1
slash plus m prime, gamma mu,

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:48.980 align:middle line:84%
and then, minus ik2 slash
plus m prime gamma nu.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.440 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:53.620 align:middle line:84%
So I just-- when I do
this-- so the spin sum

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.380 align:middle line:84%
is crucial for this
simplification.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:01.300 align:middle line:84%
When I sum over spins,
and then without using

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:07.360 align:middle line:84%
explicit expression of those u
and v, we can write all of them

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.930 align:middle line:84%
just in terms of p slash
and k slash, et cetera.

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:13.930 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:16.600 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And now we can
evaluate the trace.

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.710 align:middle line:90%
OK, so evaluate the trace.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Now we need to use
the various formula.

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:29.280 align:middle line:84%
I think some of them you
have done in your pset.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.430 align:middle line:90%
Is that now recall.

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:38.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is the place, all those
exercises, they become useful.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.910 align:middle line:90%
So become mu.

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So here, if you look at the
structure of these terms--

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.122 align:middle line:90%
so here, there's a p slash.

00:27:48.122 --> 00:27:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So there's one
gamma matrix here.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
gamma matrix here.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.002 align:middle line:84%
And here, p slash is
the gamma matrix here.

00:27:56.002 --> 00:27:57.210 align:middle line:90%
There's another gamma matrix.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So at the most, we can have
the product of the 4 gamma

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:02.100 align:middle line:90%
matrices inside the trace.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And also, depend
on the product, we

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.270 align:middle line:90%
can have four, three, and two.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:07.350 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:middle line:90%
Three and two.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:15.960 align:middle line:84%
So for this purpose, we need
to delete those formulas.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:21.480 align:middle line:84%
What are the product of the four
matrices inside the integral?

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:30.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is just given by eta mu
nu, eta lambda rho, plus eta mu

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:32.070 align:middle line:90%
rho--

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:44.580 align:middle line:84%
eta mu rho eta mu lambda minus
eta mu lambda eta mu rho.

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.160 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And also if you have
three gamma matrices,

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.380 align:middle line:90%
do you know the answer?

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.885 align:middle line:90%


00:28:54.885 --> 00:28:55.770 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:57.210 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:58.020 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And if I have two
gamma matrices,

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.285 align:middle line:90%
do you know what is this?

00:29:06.285 --> 00:29:07.230 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: 4 eta mu nu.

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:09.280 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: That's
right, it's 4 eta mu mu.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:09.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:14.040 align:middle line:84%
So you can just apply
those formulas to here.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:18.390 align:middle line:84%
So we'll not do the
calculation explicitly.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:22.500 align:middle line:90%
So you can just plug them in.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.480 align:middle line:90%
And then, it's mechanical.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.100 align:middle line:90%
You can just calculate it.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you find 1 over
4 sum over spin m squared

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.780 align:middle line:84%
is equal to-- let me
write down the answer.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.660 align:middle line:84%
So even though this
answer is slightly long,

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.580 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's
instructive to write it

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:46.660 align:middle line:90%
down so that you see it.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:52.530 align:middle line:84%
So when you plug all this
in and do the algebras,

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and you find that the expression
can be written as this,

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:14.570 align:middle line:84%
k1 dot p1 k2 dot p2 plus
p1 dot k2 and p2 dot k1.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:24.484 align:middle line:84%
Then minus m square k1
dot k2 minus m square p1

00:30:24.484 --> 00:30:28.130 align:middle line:90%
dot p2 m prime square.

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:29.210 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:39.545 align:middle line:84%
Here it should be m prime square
plus 2m square m prime square.

00:30:39.545 --> 00:30:40.045 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:40.045 --> 00:30:43.020 align:middle line:90%


00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:49.020 align:middle line:84%
So we discussed before
that the amplitude square

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.770 align:middle line:90%
must be a Lorentz scalar.

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:55.410 align:middle line:90%
OK, it must be a Lorentz scalar.

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And so you see it
explicitly, here.

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:02.570 align:middle line:84%
So it only involves either
m square, m prime square,

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:06.170 align:middle line:84%
or the product dot product of
the initial and final momentum,

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:06.890 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And you see all
kinds of combination

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:14.690 align:middle line:84%
of the initial and final
momentum appearing here.

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:18.510 align:middle line:90%
And now, so it's convention--

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:20.550 align:middle line:84%
so as we mentioned
before, actually,

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:23.640 align:middle line:84%
if you look at all
these different dot

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:28.090 align:middle line:84%
product between initial
and final momentum,

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:34.100 align:middle line:84%
actually, because of the
momentum conservation--

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:41.170 align:middle line:84%
And actually, there are only
two Lorentz invariant, OK?

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:45.220 align:middle line:84%
So it would be
convenient to write

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:50.650 align:middle line:84%
this or this in terms of those
two Lorentz invariant, OK?

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:55.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's the two
of the stu variables

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:56.770 align:middle line:90%
we defined previously.

00:31:56.770 --> 00:32:00.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's often just to
use stu the same time.

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:04.000 align:middle line:90%
So we just-- yeah.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.970 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you write
them in terms of stu,

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:10.980 align:middle line:90%
and then you find, for example--

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.910 align:middle line:84%
let me just give
you some example.

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:15.438 align:middle line:90%
For example, 2k1 p1.

00:32:15.438 --> 00:32:18.060 align:middle line:90%


00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:21.960 align:middle line:84%
So this can be
written as t minus m

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.830 align:middle line:84%
square minus m
prime square, which

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:33.300 align:middle line:90%
is the same as 2k2 dot p2, OK?

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And 2k1 dot p2, then it's
actually equal to 2k2 dot p1,

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:48.600 align:middle line:84%
then equal to u minus m
square minus m prime square.

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And then, since related
to the initial momentum--

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:59.280 align:middle line:84%
then related to the s equal
to s minus 2m square and minus

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:05.430 align:middle line:84%
k1 k2 equal to s
minus 2m prime square.

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:11.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, So you just apply
those equations in here.

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Then, you can write them
in terms of stu variables.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, you find that one
over sum over spin m squared

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:28.610 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the following
expression, 2e to the power 4 s

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:39.930 align:middle line:84%
square t minus m square
m prime square square

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:47.670 align:middle line:84%
plus u minus m square minus m
prime square square plus 2s.

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:51.350 align:middle line:90%


00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:53.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:59.420 align:middle line:84%
So recall that s plus
t plus u equal to 2.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.420 align:middle line:90%


00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So you can eliminate
one of them.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.090 align:middle line:84%
So you can eliminate
one of them.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:14.989 align:middle line:84%
So this concludes
the calculation

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:18.350 align:middle line:90%
of the scattering amplitude.

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:21.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's the
expression you get, OK?

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And you see that
it's all expressed

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.620 align:middle line:90%
in terms of this stu--

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:30.909 align:middle line:84%
can be expressed nicely in
terms of these stu variables.

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:32.170 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:37.389 align:middle line:90%


00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:39.130 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:42.730 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's calculate
the cross section.

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And our goal will be to
calculate the total cross

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.370 align:middle line:90%
section, OK?

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And so for this purpose, let's
do the center of mass frame,

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:50.790 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:54.120 align:middle line:90%


00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.699 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to consider
the center of mass frame.

00:34:56.699 --> 00:34:59.640 align:middle line:90%


00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.715 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is the simplest.

00:35:01.715 --> 00:35:05.370 align:middle line:90%


00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:08.675 align:middle line:84%
So remember, in the
center of mass frame we--

00:35:08.675 --> 00:35:11.900 align:middle line:90%


00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:14.690 align:middle line:90%
so first we need to--

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:17.120 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so remember the
center of mass frame

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:30.085 align:middle line:84%
you get that d sigma, d
omega cm is given by--

00:35:30.085 --> 00:35:36.780 align:middle line:90%


00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:37.280 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.590 align:middle line:90%
Let me check my formula.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly I'm not sure
what I'm looking for.

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so it's given
by, say, the M

00:35:49.330 --> 00:36:00.230 align:middle line:84%
square divided by p cm prime
divided by 64 pi square

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:03.890 align:middle line:90%
s pcm prime.

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:09.110 align:middle line:84%
So pcm prime is the momentum
for the final particles.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And pcm is the momentum in
the center of mass frame

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.420 align:middle line:90%
for the initial particles.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:17.040 align:middle line:90%


00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:22.980 align:middle line:84%
So now, we also need to
find the pcm, et cetera, OK?

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:28.440 align:middle line:84%
We also need to express the
m, the amplitude in terms

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.800 align:middle line:84%
of the center of
mass square, OK?

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So in the center
of mass frame, then

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:38.910 align:middle line:84%
we have the p1 would
be, say, E, pcm.

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:42.660 align:middle line:90%


00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:49.200 align:middle line:84%
OK, the p2 will be equal
to the same E, minus pcm.

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, they have the
same E, because they

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:53.930 align:middle line:90%
have the same mass.

00:36:53.930 --> 00:37:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, k1 would
be E prime, pcm prime.

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And the k2 would be E
prime, minus pcm prime.

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:22.490 align:middle line:90%


00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:25.310 align:middle line:84%
So now, from energy
conservation,

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:28.730 align:middle line:84%
immediately concluded that
E must be equal to E prime.

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:33.200 align:middle line:84%
So I can forget about E prime,
because the total energy

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.340 align:middle line:90%
will be 2E.

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And the final energy
will also be 2e.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:40.540 align:middle line:84%
So e have to be
equal to e prime.

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:42.620 align:middle line:90%
And then we can find--

00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And so E would be equal to
one half square root of s, OK?

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.620 align:middle line:90%
So this is the--

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:54.360 align:middle line:90%


00:37:54.360 --> 00:38:01.110 align:middle line:84%
or s is equal to 4E square,
because the p1 plus p2

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:02.550 align:middle line:90%
is just 2E.

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:05.070 align:middle line:84%
You square it, it
becomes 4E square.

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And then we find the
pcm square equal to s

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:16.700 align:middle line:90%
divided by 4 minus m square.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:23.165 align:middle line:84%
And the pcm prime
square equal to

00:38:23.165 --> 00:38:26.360 align:middle line:84%
s divided by 4 minus
s prime square.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:39.320 align:middle line:90%


00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:42.330 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:43.573 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:43.573 --> 00:38:47.810 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: We know that
[INAUDIBLE] first component

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:50.012 align:middle line:84%
of your 4 vector, they
have some [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:50.012 --> 00:38:51.470 align:middle line:84%
But how do you know
that it exactly

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:55.070 align:middle line:90%
has to split [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:55.790 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:58.332 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: How do you know that
the final state particles have

00:38:58.332 --> 00:38:59.647 align:middle line:90%
to have the same energy?

00:38:59.647 --> 00:39:00.230 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:02.060 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: But you know that
there's some that have to be--

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:03.290 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, because
they have the same mass.

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:03.980 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:04.430 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:06.138 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because they
have momentum opposite

00:39:06.138 --> 00:39:08.180 align:middle line:84%
to each other in the
center of mass frame.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.350 align:middle line:90%
And they have the same mass.

00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:11.433 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So you can allow
for your final particle

00:39:11.433 --> 00:39:13.910 align:middle line:84%
to have-- final particles to
have different masses and then

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:14.510 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE].

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:16.040 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but in this
process, we are

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.660 align:middle line:84%
considering the-- always the
particle and the antiparticle.

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:21.890 align:middle line:90%
It's an annihilation process.

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:26.500 align:middle line:84%
We always create the particle
and the antiparticle together.

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:29.640 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:35.530 align:middle line:84%
OK, So you can
similarly express the t.

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:37.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, you can similarly
express the t

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:43.810 align:middle line:84%
and u in terms of this center of
mass, the momentum, et cetera.

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:48.400 align:middle line:90%
and So you can just do that.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:53.223 align:middle line:84%
So let me just write
down the final answer.

00:39:53.223 --> 00:39:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Let me just write
down the final answer.

00:39:54.890 --> 00:40:00.640 align:middle line:84%
You can also rewrite
1/4 sum spin,

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:07.160 align:middle line:84%
m squared equal to, in
terms of the center of mass.

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And then you find it's
equal to e to the power 4,

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:17.600 align:middle line:84%
1 plus m squared
plus m prime squared

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:28.860 align:middle line:84%
divided by E squared
plus pcm squared, pcm

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.840 align:middle line:90%
prime squared cosine theta.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:34.850 align:middle line:90%


00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:39.590 align:middle line:90%
OK, and the theta is the--

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:45.860 align:middle line:84%
so you have the scattering of
the initial particle with pcm.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the finite
particle with the pcm prime.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:54.770 align:middle line:90%
And so this angle is theta, OK?

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:55.730 align:middle line:90%
This angle is theta.

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:59.800 align:middle line:90%


00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And so the theta comes from
when you calculate using the--

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:07.950 align:middle line:90%
involving t and u, OK?

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:10.670 align:middle line:90%
Involving t and u.

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:14.060 align:middle line:90%
And so now we have everything.

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:15.340 align:middle line:90%
So we have the pcm.

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:18.890 align:middle line:90%


00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:21.640 align:middle line:90%
It's all in terms of s.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And then your amplitude is also
expressed in terms of either s

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.545 align:middle line:90%
or E. Yeah, E is also the s.

00:41:29.545 --> 00:41:31.920 align:middle line:90%
And then we have the theta, OK?

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.350 align:middle line:90%
Then we have the theta.

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:38.170 align:middle line:84%
So you just plug the
whole thing into here.

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Just plug the whole
thing into here.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you find the
total cross-section.

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:46.300 align:middle line:90%


00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:53.830 align:middle line:84%
You just do d sigma, d
omega, center of mass frame,

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and then sine theta
d theta d phi.

00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:00.370 align:middle line:90%
OK, nothing here depends on phi.

00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:03.220 align:middle line:84%
So the phi integral, you
can just done trivially.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And then you just need
to do the theta integral.

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:06.380 align:middle line:90%
And then you have this.

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:09.370 align:middle line:90%


00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So again, let me just write
down the final answer.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:22.070 align:middle line:84%
So in the end, you get 4 pi
alpha squared divided by s.

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:26.340 align:middle line:84%
So the alpha is the
fine-structure constant.

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so the alpha is e
squared divided by 4 pi,

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.300 align:middle line:90%
is the fine-structure constant.

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is 4 pi
alpha squared, 3s,

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:49.130 align:middle line:84%
and then 1 minus m prime
squared divided by e squared, 1

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:52.675 align:middle line:84%
minus m squared
divided by e squared.

00:42:52.675 --> 00:42:55.580 align:middle line:90%


00:42:55.580 --> 00:43:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing times 1
plus m squared divided by 2e

00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:03.090 align:middle line:90%
squared.

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:05.700 align:middle line:90%


00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And the 1 plus m prime
squared divided by 2e squared.

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:13.910 align:middle line:90%


00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:16.460 align:middle line:90%
So this is the final answer.

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is the answer you
can compare with experiments.

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:22.577 align:middle line:84%
So this is also you can
compare with experiments.

00:43:22.577 --> 00:43:28.660 align:middle line:90%


00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:31.310 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you look
at this answer,

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:40.590 align:middle line:84%
it's almost completely symmetric
in terms of m and m prime

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:43.980 align:middle line:84%
except that for this
ratio, the m is downstairs

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:46.230 align:middle line:90%
and m prime is upstairs.

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:48.624 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, it's the-- yeah.

00:43:48.624 --> 00:43:53.640 align:middle line:90%


00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.590 align:middle line:90%
So this m prime is upstairs.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:58.830 align:middle line:90%
Of course, it's the--

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:01.160 align:middle line:90%
do I have the--

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.000 align:middle line:90%
yeah, yeah.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.880 align:middle line:90%


00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:05.380 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:10.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so this factor is key.

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, you have to have
such kind of factor

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:15.260 align:middle line:84%
in the upstairs
because of when E,

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:19.620 align:middle line:84%
you have to be E to be greater
than m prime squared in order

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:22.120 align:middle line:90%
to produce the particle.

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:26.770 align:middle line:84%
If your energy is not
big enough to produce--

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:30.130 align:middle line:84%
in order to produce a b and
b bar, your energy at least--

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:33.850 align:middle line:90%


00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:37.630 align:middle line:84%
so each E has to be large
enough to be greater

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:43.180 align:middle line:84%
than m, because your
2E, total energy,

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.740 align:middle line:90%
must be greater than 2m prime.

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:47.530 align:middle line:90%


00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And so you see that when
E is smaller than m prime

00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:57.550 align:middle line:84%
and when E equals to m prime,
then this factor becomes 0.

00:44:57.550 --> 00:44:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And then the
cross-section becomes 0.

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:02.700 align:middle line:90%


00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:03.960 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:07.510 align:middle line:90%


00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:11.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now let's consider
some specific cases.

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:45.670 align:middle line:90%


00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:57.480 align:middle line:84%
So now let's consider e
plus, e minus going to muon.

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:06.350 align:middle line:84%
So the muon is the next massive
lepton after the electron.

00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:14.010 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, say me -- m
square will be m e squared.

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And the m prime squared
will be m mu squared.

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:22.820 align:middle line:90%
And the m mu--

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:26.420 align:middle line:90%
so the muon mass is 207 MeV.

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:29.880 align:middle line:90%


00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:33.105 align:middle line:90%
No, it's the 100--

00:46:33.105 --> 00:46:36.702 align:middle line:90%


00:46:36.702 --> 00:46:38.160 align:middle line:84%
actually, I didn't
code the number.

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:44.105 align:middle line:84%
So the muon mass is 207 times
m, the mass of the electron.

00:46:44.105 --> 00:46:46.870 align:middle line:90%


00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:49.840 align:middle line:84%
So does anybody remember
the electron mass?

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.067 align:middle line:90%


00:46:53.067 --> 00:46:54.735 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:54.735 --> 00:46:55.360 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Hmm?

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:56.790 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: 0.511 MeV.

00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:58.040 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.

00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:00.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, 0.5--

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:01.750 align:middle line:90%
1?

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:02.727 align:middle line:90%
Did you say 1?

00:47:02.727 --> 00:47:03.310 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:04.360 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's 511 KeV.

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:12.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, 0.511 MeV.

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And the muon is the 207 times
the mass of the electron.

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:18.730 align:middle line:90%


00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:22.240 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
create the muon, then

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.905 align:middle line:90%
the initial total energy--

00:47:23.905 --> 00:47:27.730 align:middle line:90%


00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:32.170 align:middle line:84%
so the square root
s, which is 2E,

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:36.370 align:middle line:84%
has to be greater
than the 2 m mu.

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:39.340 align:middle line:84%
So that means that the E
has to be greater than m mu.

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:42.010 align:middle line:90%


00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And then this is much, much
larger than the electron mass.

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:50.230 align:middle line:90%


00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:52.870 align:middle line:84%
So this is about
200 times larger

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:57.936 align:middle line:84%
than m E. So that
means actually that,

00:47:57.936 --> 00:48:01.935 align:middle line:84%
for all purposes, that you can
just neglect the electron mass.

00:48:01.935 --> 00:48:06.610 align:middle line:90%


00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:09.870 align:middle line:90%
So this ratio is tiny.

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:10.680 align:middle line:90%
It's tiny.

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:15.203 align:middle line:84%
So we can treat essentially
the electron as massless.

00:48:15.203 --> 00:48:16.786 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the denominator,

00:48:16.786 --> 00:48:22.060 align:middle line:84%
and we added those
to the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:25.508 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, just
not well defined, yeah.

00:48:25.508 --> 00:48:28.760 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
makes sense that it would.

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.990 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, you don't
even-- yeah, in this case,

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:32.115 align:middle line:90%
you don't even go to that--

00:48:32.115 --> 00:48:34.940 align:middle line:90%


00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:38.930 align:middle line:90%
so in the case that the--

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:40.220 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:40.730 align:middle line:90%
Let me see.

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:46.260 align:middle line:90%


00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:48.885 align:middle line:90%
Let me think a little bit.

00:48:48.885 --> 00:48:49.385 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:49.385 --> 00:48:53.150 align:middle line:90%


00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:55.010 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:58.200 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, for this case, of
course it's not well defined.

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.230 align:middle line:84%
But in the opposite
case, let's imagine

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:05.000 align:middle line:84%
if you have the two very
massive particles to collide

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.610 align:middle line:90%
to create a lighter particle.

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:10.918 align:middle line:90%
And then in that case--

00:49:10.918 --> 00:49:12.710 align:middle line:84%
yeah, actually, I don't
remember the answer

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:13.668 align:middle line:90%
from my top of my head.

00:49:13.668 --> 00:49:15.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's a good question.

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:19.510 align:middle line:84%
I will try to find
it afterwards.

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:22.350 align:middle line:90%
Any other questions?

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:24.680 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:28.550 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, so
when the electron

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:30.260 align:middle line:90%
mass is much larger than--

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:35.030 align:middle line:84%
when the muon mass is much
larger than the electron mass,

00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:44.630 align:middle line:84%
then we can set
essentially m e equal to 0.

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, the
formula becomes simpler.

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:49.900 align:middle line:90%


00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:52.000 align:middle line:84%
In this case, it
becomes simpler.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.890 align:middle line:84%
The downstairs is
just equal to 1.

00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:59.830 align:middle line:90%
And this factor also becomes 1.

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:03.420 align:middle line:90%
This factor also becomes 1.

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:05.385 align:middle line:84%
So then there are two
interesting regimes.

00:50:05.385 --> 00:50:15.510 align:middle line:90%


00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:18.260 align:middle line:84%
There are two
interesting regimes.

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:20.980 align:middle line:84%
So the first is you
just near the threshold.

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:36.980 align:middle line:90%


00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:39.380 align:middle line:84%
OK, just near the
threshold means

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:46.645 align:middle line:84%
that the pcm prime is much,
much smaller than m mu.

00:50:46.645 --> 00:50:50.150 align:middle line:90%


00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So in this regime, then the E
would be approximately just m

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:57.560 align:middle line:90%
mu.

00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And then the s would be
approximately just for m mu

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:01.520 align:middle line:90%
squared.

00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:04.440 align:middle line:90%


00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:09.030 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you just look
at that expression--

00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:11.580 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so let's look
at that expression.

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:13.713 align:middle line:90%
Then, you find the--

00:51:13.713 --> 00:51:20.240 align:middle line:90%


00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:28.170 align:middle line:84%
yeah, then you find that the
differential cross-section

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:36.400 align:middle line:84%
is equal to alpha squared
over 8 m mu squared and then

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:42.890 align:middle line:84%
pcm prime divided by m mu
plus higher-order corrections.

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:47.170 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you expand in
pcm divided by m mu--

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:48.850 align:middle line:90%
pcm prime divided by m mu.

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And the total
cross-section is just

00:51:53.240 --> 00:52:00.350 align:middle line:84%
given by pi alpha
squared, 2 mu squared

00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:05.320 align:middle line:90%
and pcm prime divided by m mu.

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.900 align:middle line:84%
OK, so here, you see
explicitly that when

00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:12.740 align:middle line:84%
you reach the threshold,
the threshold corresponding

00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:15.080 align:middle line:90%
to this quantity goes to 0.

00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:23.420 align:middle line:84%
So when this quantity goes to 0,
then you, at the cross-section,

00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:25.050 align:middle line:90%
go to 0.

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:30.695 align:middle line:84%
So another regime of interest is
the ultra-relativistic regime.

00:52:30.695 --> 00:52:41.660 align:middle line:90%


00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:44.000 align:middle line:90%
So ultra-relativistic regime.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.640 align:middle line:84%
So in this case,
we can take E to be

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:52.400 align:middle line:84%
much, much both than m e and
m mu, so also much greater

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.690 align:middle line:90%
than m mu.

00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So of course, it's already
much greater than m e.

00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:00.890 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, then
you can, just here--

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:04.520 align:middle line:90%


00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:06.500 align:middle line:84%
you can just essentially
take the both mass

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:08.180 align:middle line:90%
to be 0 in this case.

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And then you find, in this
case, that d sigma, d omega

00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:19.400 align:middle line:84%
cm just given by alpha
squared divided by 4s--

00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:22.345 align:middle line:90%


00:53:22.345 --> 00:53:25.670 align:middle line:90%
squared theta.

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:27.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And then you can find
the total cross-section.

00:53:29.570 --> 00:53:46.900 align:middle line:90%


00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:51.640 align:middle line:84%
So you can find the
total cross-section

00:53:51.640 --> 00:54:01.610 align:middle line:84%
given by 4 pi alpha
squared divided by 3s.

00:54:01.610 --> 00:54:04.350 align:middle line:90%


00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:08.520 align:middle line:84%
So now, this final
formula is very simple.

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:12.150 align:middle line:84%
So you could have
written down this formula

00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:17.420 align:middle line:84%
without doing any calculation,
of course up to the prefactor,

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:20.120 align:middle line:90%
just on a dimensional grounds.

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:24.920 align:middle line:84%
So in the ultra-relativistic
regime, then essentially

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:27.620 align:middle line:84%
you can neglect both the
mass of the initial particle

00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:29.870 align:middle line:90%
and the final product.

00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And then in this whole process,
if the initial particle

00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:37.960 align:middle line:84%
is massless and the final
particle is massless, then

00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:42.320 align:middle line:84%
for this whole process,
the only scale is, what?

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:45.660 align:middle line:90%


00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:47.430 align:middle line:90%
The only scale is s, OK?

00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:49.290 align:middle line:90%
That's the only scale.

00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:53.080 align:middle line:90%
So the only scale is s.

00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:55.040 align:middle line:90%
And then that means--

00:54:55.040 --> 00:55:00.460 align:middle line:84%
and this should
have dimension area.

00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:04.035 align:middle line:84%
And then that means that
there should be 1 over s.

00:55:04.035 --> 00:55:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And then alpha
squared just comes

00:55:05.410 --> 00:55:10.785 align:middle line:84%
from because we have two vertex
from a two-level process.

00:55:10.785 --> 00:55:15.765 align:middle line:90%


00:55:15.765 --> 00:55:16.265 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:55:16.265 --> 00:55:23.080 align:middle line:90%


00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:24.610 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:26.125 align:middle line:90%
So if you draw the plot--

00:55:26.125 --> 00:55:32.130 align:middle line:90%


00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:36.125 align:middle line:84%
so often, if we draw the
total cross-section times s--

00:55:36.125 --> 00:55:39.580 align:middle line:90%


00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:42.160 align:middle line:84%
so s times the
total cross-section

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:45.320 align:middle line:84%
as a function of the
square root of s,

00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:50.340 align:middle line:84%
then the threshold
is at 2 mu, 2 m mu.

00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And then here it goes to
0, like a square root.

00:55:58.070 --> 00:56:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to,
say, approach your constant.

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:09.320 align:middle line:84%
This is 4 pi alpha
squared divided by 3.

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:11.150 align:middle line:90%
So you have a curve like this.

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:20.390 align:middle line:90%


00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:26.830 align:middle line:84%
So now let's consider
using this process

00:56:26.830 --> 00:56:31.060 align:middle line:84%
to show that actually the
quarks have three colors.

00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:33.370 align:middle line:90%
The quarks have three colors.

00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:41.560 align:middle line:84%
So for this purpose, let's
consider e plus plus e minus

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:42.395 align:middle line:90%
goes to hadrons.

00:56:42.395 --> 00:56:49.400 align:middle line:90%


00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:54.210 align:middle line:84%
So this seemingly is a
very complicated process.

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:57.560 align:middle line:84%
Seemingly, this is a
very complicated process.

00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:05.820 align:middle line:84%
It's because the-- so
suppose if you have e plus,

00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:10.290 align:middle line:84%
you create a quark
and an antiquark pair.

00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:17.630 align:middle line:84%
But you remember, the quarks
they are confined, OK?

00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:20.390 align:middle line:84%
So we don't observe
individual quarks.

00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:23.720 align:middle line:84%
It's because the QCD is
strongly interacting.

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And so the quarks are confined
inside the proton, pions,

00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:29.380 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And so in this process, even
though it originally created

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:38.670 align:middle line:84%
a quark, but each individual
quark and antiquark,

00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:43.170 align:middle line:84%
they cannot survive
on their own.

00:57:43.170 --> 00:57:45.960 align:middle line:84%
So their presence will
polarize the vacuum,

00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:49.640 align:middle line:90%
create many other particles.

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:53.700 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
that you create--

00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:58.070 align:middle line:84%
so each of them will create lots
of particles along with them.

00:57:58.070 --> 00:58:00.740 align:middle line:84%
So in the end, it's a
complicated product.

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:02.630 align:middle line:90%
You observe many hadrons.

00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:04.880 align:middle line:90%
You observe many hadrons.

00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
in the detector,

00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:09.620 align:middle line:84%
we don't directly observe
those quarks and antiquarks.

00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:10.870 align:middle line:90%
We just observe those hadrons.

00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:14.340 align:middle line:90%


00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:20.250 align:middle line:84%
So then you say, how
do we have any hope

00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:23.700 align:middle line:84%
to be able to understand this
process just by measuring

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:27.000 align:middle line:84%
this very complicated product,
because this product can

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.700 align:middle line:84%
have protons, neutrons, pions,
can also have other things?

00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And then this is a very
complicated process.

00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:39.240 align:middle line:84%
But now, the key
is the following.

00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:41.530 align:middle line:84%
But now the key
is the following.

00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, if you look
at the question

00:58:45.350 --> 00:58:49.380 align:middle line:84%
of going to each individual
hadron is complicated.

00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:55.920 align:middle line:84%
But if you can see the so-called
inclusive process, which

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:59.850 align:middle line:84%
goes to all possible
hadrons in this process,

00:58:59.850 --> 00:59:01.830 align:middle line:84%
then that probability
is just given

00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:04.520 align:middle line:90%
by the total cross-section.

00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the
total cross-section

00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:10.710 align:middle line:84%
just matches the
total probability

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:12.870 align:middle line:90%
to create such particles.

00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
are created, they

00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:19.980 align:middle line:84%
go through a
complicated process.

00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:22.830 align:middle line:90%
But that process is unitary.

00:59:22.830 --> 00:59:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Will not-- will be,
say, all probability 1

00:59:27.210 --> 00:59:30.640 align:middle line:84%
to go to all possible
final products.

00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:32.980 align:middle line:84%
So if we include the
cross-section going

00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:35.430 align:middle line:84%
into all possible
final products,

00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:38.810 align:middle line:84%
that probability just captures
by the total cross-section.

00:59:38.810 --> 00:59:48.080 align:middle line:84%
So the total cross-section for
this process, for the e plus,

00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:50.660 align:middle line:84%
e minus going to
q, q bar, and then

00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:54.790 align:middle line:84%
just including the
total cross-section,

00:59:54.790 --> 01:00:13.110 align:middle line:84%
so inclusive section for all
hadron products, this way,

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:18.307 align:middle line:84%
we can actually measure
this process indirectly,

01:00:18.307 --> 01:00:20.390 align:middle line:84%
even though you don't
directly measure the quarks.

01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:24.580 align:middle line:90%


01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:29.370 align:middle line:84%
So now let's calculate
the total cross-section.

01:00:29.370 --> 01:00:31.710 align:middle line:84%
So now let's calculate
the total cross-section.

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:35.470 align:middle line:90%


01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And now we also
don't have a choice

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:41.270 align:middle line:90%
which quark will be produced.

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:47.780 align:middle line:84%
So we need to sum over the total
cross-section for e plus, e

01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:52.860 align:middle line:84%
minus goes to, say,
different kind of quarks.

01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:55.155 align:middle line:84%
So i corresponding to
different types of quarks.

01:00:55.155 --> 01:01:10.030 align:middle line:90%


01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So each of them, we
can just write it

01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:14.180 align:middle line:90%
down using our formula.

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:16.180 align:middle line:90%
So the only difference--

01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:21.610 align:middle line:84%
the only difference-- so
the same diagram applies.

01:01:21.610 --> 01:01:25.490 align:middle line:90%


01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:28.400 align:middle line:84%
The only difference is that the
quark has a different charge

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.540 align:middle line:90%
from the electron.

01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:35.210 align:middle line:90%
So here is i e gamma mu.

01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Here, we should use the
charge for the quark.

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:43.160 align:middle line:90%
So that would be i qe gamma mu.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.400 align:middle line:84%
q would be the quark
of the charge compared

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:49.870 align:middle line:90%
to the charge of the electron.

01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:53.650 align:middle line:90%
So then what do we get?

01:01:53.650 --> 01:02:01.030 align:middle line:84%
So suppose qi is the
charge for the quark qi.

01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:05.230 align:middle line:90%
And then this gives you--

01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:09.376 align:middle line:84%
so this total is
going to all hadrons--

01:02:09.376 --> 01:02:11.048 align:middle line:90%
to all hadrons.

01:02:11.048 --> 01:02:15.930 align:middle line:90%


01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:24.360 align:middle line:84%
So this will be given by sum
over the number of colors.

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And c is the number of
colors for each quark.

01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:30.520 align:middle line:90%
And then i will be the flavor.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Now the i is the
flavor of quark,

01:02:36.970 --> 01:02:40.840 align:middle line:84%
so whether it's the u quark
or d quark or charm quark,

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:41.560 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:44.840 align:middle line:90%
And c is the number of colors.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:49.490 align:middle line:90%
And then you have qi squared.

01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And then you have sigma e plus,
e minus to mu plus, mu minus.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.960 align:middle line:90%
The rest is the same.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So for each type of quark,
this is exactly the same.

01:03:01.890 --> 01:03:04.610 align:middle line:90%
You just replace iq--

01:03:04.610 --> 01:03:06.470 align:middle line:90%
this vertex by iqi.

01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:07.820 align:middle line:90%
And then you get the qi squared.

01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:13.060 align:middle line:90%


01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:13.560 align:middle line:90%
Good?

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.336 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:03:15.336 --> 01:03:17.170 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So you
talked about how when

01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:18.740 align:middle line:90%
the quarks hadronize the--

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:19.970 align:middle line:90%
polarized the vacuum.

01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:20.821 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:03:20.821 --> 01:03:27.210 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
very small [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:29.648 align:middle line:84%
calculate out every
possible [INAUDIBLE]??

01:03:29.648 --> 01:03:31.690 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, that's a
very complicated process.

01:03:31.690 --> 01:03:33.280 align:middle line:90%
We cannot.

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's a very
complicated process.

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:40.148 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge field
to study that, yeah.

01:03:40.148 --> 01:03:41.690 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: But then
how do you account

01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:43.922 align:middle line:84%
for all possible
outcomes outputs?

01:03:43.922 --> 01:03:46.580 align:middle line:84%
You're probably accounting
for all possible quarks.

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:47.960 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: No, you just measure.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.518 align:middle line:84%
You just measure all
possible products, right?

01:03:50.518 --> 01:03:52.143 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: But here,
you're just summing

01:03:52.143 --> 01:03:55.850 align:middle line:84%
over the probability of the
flavors and the [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:55.850 --> 01:03:58.450 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, that's the
only thing you can produce.

01:03:58.450 --> 01:04:00.992 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: And then you're not
worrying about the final states

01:04:00.992 --> 01:04:02.730 align:middle line:90%
that happen from these quarks?

01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:04.290 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:07.290 align:middle line:84%
No, as I said
earlier, we only need

01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:09.150 align:middle line:90%
to worry about this process.

01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And then this process into
hadrons is complicated.

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:17.610 align:middle line:84%
But this happens with
probability 1, OK?

01:04:17.610 --> 01:04:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And so if we calculate
this probability,

01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:22.230 align:middle line:84%
then we know the total
probability to here.

01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:23.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because this happens
with probability 1.

01:04:27.550 --> 01:04:28.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:29.946 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:29.946 --> 01:04:35.170 align:middle line:90%


01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:37.706 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:37.706 --> 01:04:39.290 align:middle line:90%
Indeed, that can happen.

01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:42.770 align:middle line:90%
But this is the leading process.

01:04:42.770 --> 01:04:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this is the
leading process.

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this is the
leading approximation.

01:04:47.370 --> 01:04:51.300 align:middle line:90%


01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:52.260 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:55.680 align:middle line:90%


01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:01.000 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now you're just
given by this formula

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.930 align:middle line:84%
because you just
multiply the qi squared

01:05:04.930 --> 01:05:09.010 align:middle line:84%
to the total cross-section of
the e plus, e minus to muon.

01:05:09.010 --> 01:05:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you sum all
the flavors and times

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.900 align:middle line:90%
the number of the colors.

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:15.370 align:middle line:90%
OK, times the number of colors.

01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:26.730 align:middle line:90%


01:05:26.730 --> 01:05:27.230 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:36.600 align:middle line:90%


01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Because all different
colors have the same charge.

01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:42.210 align:middle line:84%
All different colors
have the same charge.

01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:48.150 align:middle line:90%


01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:49.830 align:middle line:90%
So now we can define a ratio.

01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:52.770 align:middle line:90%


01:05:52.770 --> 01:05:54.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
same for everybody.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.640 align:middle line:90%
So this is just factorize.

01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:01.765 align:middle line:84%
So we can define a ratio
for the quantity called r--

01:06:01.765 --> 01:06:22.320 align:middle line:90%


01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:23.100 align:middle line:90%
called r.

01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:28.290 align:middle line:90%


01:06:28.290 --> 01:06:32.370 align:middle line:84%
It's defined by
sigma e plus, e minus

01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:41.130 align:middle line:84%
goes to hadrons divided
by sigma e plus, e minus

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:44.700 align:middle line:90%
goes to mu plus, mu minus.

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is just given by sum
nc times sum over i flavor

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:51.720 align:middle line:90%
and the qi squared.

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:57.840 align:middle line:90%


01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And this i, of course
you should only

01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:05.970 align:middle line:84%
sum over i, which is
allowed by your energy, OK?

01:07:05.970 --> 01:07:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Those quarks which
are too heavy will not

01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:09.730 align:middle line:90%
be created by your energ--

01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:11.850 align:middle line:90%
You are not including the sum.

01:07:11.850 --> 01:07:25.540 align:middle line:84%
So flavor of quarks allowed
by energy, by initial energy.

01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:28.450 align:middle line:84%
If the quarks are too heavy,
then of course you cannot

01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:31.110 align:middle line:90%
create them.

01:07:31.110 --> 01:07:38.600 align:middle line:84%
So now let's list
the quarks we know.

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:42.600 align:middle line:84%
The process-- I will
not do the final one.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:46.070 align:middle line:84%
So we have u quark, d quark,
strange quark, charm quark,

01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:47.030 align:middle line:90%
bottom quark.

01:07:47.030 --> 01:07:48.290 align:middle line:90%
And then there's a top quark.

01:07:48.290 --> 01:07:49.980 align:middle line:90%
The top quark is very heavy.

01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And its process
will be complicated.

01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:55.800 align:middle line:90%
So let's not worry about that.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:58.770 align:middle line:84%
So then the charge
for each of them.

01:07:58.770 --> 01:08:01.280 align:middle line:90%
So this is 2/3.

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:03.160 align:middle line:90%
So this is minus 1/3.

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:06.430 align:middle line:90%
This is minus 1/3.

01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:09.160 align:middle line:90%
This is 2/3.

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:12.060 align:middle line:90%
This is minus 1/3.

01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And then the mass,
twice of the mass.

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:18.090 align:middle line:84%
So I'll just give you
some rough number.

01:08:18.090 --> 01:08:22.229 align:middle line:90%
So u would be about a few MeV.

01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:24.960 align:middle line:90%
So this is a few MeV.

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:28.979 align:middle line:90%
So this, again, is a few MeV.

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:30.560 align:middle line:90%
Just a few MeV, OK?

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:33.330 align:middle line:90%


01:08:33.330 --> 01:08:36.330 align:middle line:90%
So the strange will become--

01:08:36.330 --> 01:08:37.920 align:middle line:90%
strange is heavier, twice.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:39.720 align:middle line:90%
It's 190 MeV.

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.649 align:middle line:90%


01:08:42.649 --> 01:08:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And the charm, the
threshold is about 3.1 GeV.

01:08:49.090 --> 01:08:52.824 align:middle line:84%
And the threshold for the
bottom quark is about 9.5 GeV--

01:08:52.824 --> 01:08:55.979 align:middle line:90%


01:08:55.979 --> 01:08:58.770 align:middle line:90%
about 9.5.

01:08:58.770 --> 01:09:07.689 align:middle line:84%
So now let's consider the value
of R as a function of energy.

01:09:07.689 --> 01:09:18.529 align:middle line:84%
So then if you consider for
s, smaller than the charm,

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:26.479 align:middle line:84%
say 3 GeV, in this case,
we can just produce uds.

01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:36.930 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, we have R equal
to nc then times, say this.

01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:40.529 align:middle line:90%
So there's one 2/3 and two 1/3.

01:09:40.529 --> 01:09:46.380 align:middle line:84%
So we have 2/3 squared
plus twice 1/3 squared--

01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:49.790 align:middle line:90%
minus 1/3 squared.

01:09:49.790 --> 01:09:53.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is giving
you nc times 2/3.

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:56.390 align:middle line:90%


01:09:56.390 --> 01:10:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And then the others,
you cannot create.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And for square root
s, say between 3 GeV

01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:21.970 align:middle line:84%
and the 9.5 GeV, the threshold
for producing the bottom quark.

01:10:21.970 --> 01:10:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Then, now you can
create the charm quark.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.640 align:middle line:90%
So you just add another 1/3.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:34.270 align:middle line:84%
So then now R becomes nc
times 10 divided by 9.

01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Just add another
2/3 squared here.

01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And then, for now, if
you have square root

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:52.140 align:middle line:84%
of s greater than
9.5 GeV, then now you

01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:54.840 align:middle line:90%
can create the bottom now.

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Then you add
another 1/3 squared.

01:10:56.820 --> 01:11:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So this R is equal
to nc times 10

01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:05.760 align:middle line:84%
divided by 9 plus
another 1/3 squared.

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:11.150 align:middle line:84%
So that gives you
nc, 11 divided by 9.

01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:18.150 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you plot
the R as a function,

01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:25.070 align:middle line:84%
say for square root s as
measured by experiment,

01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:31.880 align:middle line:84%
you should see a threshold at
3, another threshold around 10--

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:36.170 align:middle line:90%
yeah, 9.5, say around 10.

01:11:36.170 --> 01:11:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And then you see
something like this.

01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:42.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm just drawing roughly.

01:11:42.690 --> 01:11:47.600 align:middle line:84%
You create
something-- something.

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
another threshold.

01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:52.528 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
another threshold.

01:11:52.528 --> 01:11:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out the first
9 is precisely at the 2.

01:11:57.570 --> 01:12:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'd say precisely it's
just up to some arrow bar.

01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is about,
say, a little bit more than 3.

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:11.640 align:middle line:90%


01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:16.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, little bit more than 3.

01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:20.890 align:middle line:90%
And then your 4 is the one here.

01:12:20.890 --> 01:12:25.520 align:middle line:90%
4 is around here, yeah.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so if you compare with
these numbers and you conclude

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:35.280 align:middle line:90%
that nc is actually exactly 3.

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:38.967 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, nc is 3, to be compatible
with this experiment.

01:12:38.967 --> 01:12:42.170 align:middle line:90%


01:12:42.170 --> 01:12:43.400 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:52.620 align:middle line:90%


01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:53.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.172 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Does this mean

01:12:55.172 --> 01:12:59.600 align:middle line:84%
that this is the dominant
process for electron, positron?

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.810 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:03.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, going to hadrons, yeah.

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:07.460 align:middle line:90%


01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:12.210 align:middle line:90%


01:13:12.210 --> 01:13:13.010 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:15.930 align:middle line:90%


01:13:15.930 --> 01:13:20.300 align:middle line:90%
So this is a very nice, simple--

01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:23.810 align:middle line:84%
even though this is a
very simple process,

01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:30.050 align:middle line:84%
actually it has very important
physical implications

01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:34.230 align:middle line:84%
and, in fact, quite profound
physical implications.

01:13:34.230 --> 01:13:38.260 align:middle line:90%


01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:40.920 align:middle line:84%
So we only have a
few minutes left.

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:47.895 align:middle line:84%
So let's say a few words
regarding the next topic.

01:13:47.895 --> 01:14:28.630 align:middle line:90%


01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:33.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's again
consider this process of e

01:14:33.610 --> 01:14:36.445 align:middle line:90%
plus, e minus going to mu--

01:14:36.445 --> 01:14:39.730 align:middle line:90%


01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:40.360 align:middle line:90%
going to mu.

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:44.580 align:middle line:90%


01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:47.310 align:middle line:90%
So we have then this diagram.

01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:53.020 align:middle line:90%


01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:55.720 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:14:55.720 --> 01:15:01.630 align:middle line:84%
So suppose this is
p1, p2, and k1 and k2.

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:05.100 align:middle line:90%


01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:09.478 align:middle line:84%
So when we draw this diagram,
we take the time as going above.

01:15:09.478 --> 01:15:10.770 align:middle line:90%
So these are the initial state.

01:15:10.770 --> 01:15:11.853 align:middle line:90%
These are the final state.

01:15:11.853 --> 01:15:17.360 align:middle line:90%


01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:21.260 align:middle line:84%
So now, if we view
this diagram sideways,

01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:25.460 align:middle line:84%
say if we view in
this direction,

01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:28.620 align:middle line:84%
if you try to think that at the
time going to right direction,

01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:34.000 align:middle line:84%
say if you try to view it
sideways, then in this case,

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.670 align:middle line:90%
if you view it sideways--

01:15:35.670 --> 01:15:46.770 align:middle line:90%


01:15:46.770 --> 01:15:47.490 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:15:47.490 --> 01:15:52.108 align:middle line:84%
And now this becomes
an initial state.

01:15:52.108 --> 01:15:53.400 align:middle line:90%
So this is still initial state.

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:56.430 align:middle line:90%
And this is still initial state.

01:15:56.430 --> 01:15:57.960 align:middle line:90%
Let me see.

01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:00.930 align:middle line:90%
Oh, let me-- oh.

01:16:00.930 --> 01:16:04.160 align:middle line:90%


01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:04.965 align:middle line:90%
One second.

01:16:04.965 --> 01:16:05.465 align:middle line:90%
Let me see.

01:16:05.465 --> 01:16:10.680 align:middle line:90%


01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:11.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:12.720 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:13.980 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, sorry.

01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, view it sideways, and
then this is the initial state.

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:21.855 align:middle line:90%
And this is the initial state.

01:16:21.855 --> 01:16:28.140 align:middle line:90%


01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Now let me draw the arrow
this way so that because the--

01:16:34.050 --> 01:16:36.280 align:middle line:90%
yeah, it doesn't matter.

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's draw the arrow this
way so that this is the mu,

01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:41.830 align:middle line:90%
this is the mu plus.

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:44.820 align:middle line:90%


01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:46.830 align:middle line:90%
And now let's view this way.

01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And now this is-- look how
you have initial electron.

01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
initial muon, OK?

01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And then this becomes a
process, e minus plus mu

01:16:56.610 --> 01:17:00.510 align:middle line:84%
minus going to e
minus and mu minus,

01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:03.300 align:middle line:84%
because this is the final
particle, now going out

01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:04.380 align:middle line:90%
will be the particle.

01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And this final particle
going out will be a particle.

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And then the final will be
the electron and the muon.

01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:17.060 align:middle line:90%


01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:21.470 align:middle line:90%
And then you get the process, b.

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.450 align:middle line:84%
So when you view it
sideways, then you

01:17:23.450 --> 01:17:24.650 align:middle line:90%
have a diagram like this.

01:17:24.650 --> 01:17:26.840 align:middle line:90%
If I draw using our--

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:30.520 align:middle line:90%
again, time going to up--

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.380 align:middle line:90%
then this is like that.

01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Now this is e minus, e minus,
mu minus, and mu minus.

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:41.270 align:middle line:90%


01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So now you wonder
whether there's

01:17:44.090 --> 01:17:49.370 align:middle line:84%
some relation between
these two processes,

01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:52.730 align:middle line:84%
whether there's some relation
between these processes

01:17:52.730 --> 01:17:57.150 align:middle line:84%
from you just exchanging initial
state to the final state.

01:17:57.150 --> 01:17:59.390 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out actually
there's a very nice relation

01:17:59.390 --> 01:18:00.770 align:middle line:90%
between them.

01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:04.170 align:middle line:84%
If you know one of them, you
can try to deduce the other.

01:18:04.170 --> 01:18:07.480 align:middle line:84%
It can help you deduce
the other, which

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:09.540 align:middle line:90%
we are running out of time.

01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:12.160 align:middle line:90%
So we will do it the next time.

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:16.000 align:middle line:90%
