00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.610 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: So at the
end of last lecture,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.450 align:middle line:84%
we start talking
about this propagator.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:29.260 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:37.030 align:middle line:84%
So in non-relativistic
quantum mechanics,

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:45.420 align:middle line:84%
in the Heisenberg picture, we
can introduce this position

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.080 align:middle line:84%
eigenvector corresponding to
the eigenvalue of the position

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:58.050 align:middle line:84%
operator at time t
with eigenvalue x.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And then from this object, you
can construct a propagator.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.680 align:middle line:90%


00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So this object is
powerful if you

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.180 align:middle line:84%
know how to compute this
object, because if you

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.310 align:middle line:84%
load the function at
t prime, and then by--

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.630 align:middle line:84%
yeah, by just integrate
it with this object,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and then you can find your
function at a later time.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a powerful object
in non-relativistic quantum

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.950 align:middle line:90%
mechanics.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.150 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can ask what
are the analogous objects--

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.800 align:middle line:84%
say whether they exist analogous
object in field theory.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:55.710 align:middle line:84%
But in QFT, there
is no natural way

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:15.760 align:middle line:84%
to define a localized
state such as--

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.750 align:middle line:84%
so there's no counterpart
of this object.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.910 align:middle line:84%
So one reason is
that now there's

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.620 align:middle line:90%
no position operator anymore.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.220 align:middle line:84%
So remember, now, x
is actually a label--

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.520 align:middle line:90%
no longer a operator.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.430 align:middle line:84%
It's the phi is the
operator. x is just a label.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.490 align:middle line:84%
So there's no-- in
quantum field theory,

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.840 align:middle line:90%
there's no position operator.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:90%


00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.800 align:middle line:84%
So you cannot-- and
then you cannot define--

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.920 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so the position
operator, then you can--

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.010 align:middle line:84%
no natural way to
define the eigenvector

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.310 align:middle line:90%
associated with localized state.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.205 align:middle line:84%
And there's also a
fundamental barrier--

00:03:00.205 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:90%


00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.280 align:middle line:84%
there's a fundamental
contradiction

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.800 align:middle line:90%
with Lorentz symmetry.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.070 align:middle line:84%
So there's also a
fundamental barrier--

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:21.675 align:middle line:84%
fundamental obstruction
from Lorentz symmetry.

00:03:21.675 --> 00:03:34.750 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:42.480 align:middle line:90%
So you can show that localized--

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:84%
you can show a
localized state in space

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.350 align:middle line:90%
is not Lorentz covariant.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:07.370 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.050 align:middle line:90%
So this does not--

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:16.100 align:middle line:84%
so suppose-- yeah, you can do
this by proof by contradiction.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Suppose they exist-- there
exist states like some states--

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.260 align:middle line:90%


00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.750 align:middle line:90%
say, x t.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:84%
So by definition, a local
state should satisfy in--

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:52.025 align:middle line:84%
if you evaluate them
at the same time,

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:56.930 align:middle line:84%
then that should be
proportional to delta function

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.480 align:middle line:84%
because that's by definition
what it means what

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:90%
we mean by a localized state--

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.760 align:middle line:90%
localized at the point.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's the property
satisfied by this.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.578 align:middle line:84%
If you set t prime equal
to t, and then this

00:05:08.578 --> 00:05:09.620 align:middle line:90%
will be a delta function.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.540 align:middle line:90%


00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.210 align:middle line:84%
But now, suppose you
can define such a state,

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.640 align:middle line:84%
but then this notion cannot
be covariant defined.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.970 align:middle line:84%
It's because this is
not a covariant object.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So the three-dimensional
spatial delta

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.850 align:middle line:84%
function that does
not transform nicely

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.630 align:middle line:90%
under Lorentz transformation.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And so you can show
that if you act--

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:48.880 align:middle line:84%
suppose U lambda is
the unitary operator

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.530 align:middle line:84%
generating a Lorentz
transformation,

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.670 align:middle line:90%
which we discussed last time.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.430 align:middle line:90%
If you have the momentum--

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.780 align:middle line:84%
if you have the generated
Lorentz transformation.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you can show that
the U lambda acting on x and t

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:16.890 align:middle line:84%
is not the same as the
lambda x and the lambda t.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.770 align:middle line:84%
So lambda x and lambda T
denotes a Lorentz transformation

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.750 align:middle line:90%
of this vector.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Here, I'm using a
shorthand notation.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.580 align:middle line:90%


00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.720 align:middle line:84%
So lambda-- x means the
Lorentz transformation acts

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.120 align:middle line:84%
on x, and here, means the
Lorentz transformation

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.200 align:middle line:90%
acts on t.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And you actually will do
this explicitly in your pset.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.660 align:middle line:90%
You will check this explicitly.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.030 align:middle line:90%
This does not transform.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.420 align:middle line:84%
So this cannot be a
covariant concept.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:56.100 align:middle line:84%
So that means that you can
most define in some frame,

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.400 align:middle line:84%
but if you change your
frame, and then this state

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.350 align:middle line:90%
is no longer localized.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:07.800 align:middle line:84%
So this concept is
not the Lorentz--

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.670 align:middle line:84%
it's not compatible
with Lorentz symmetry.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:21.660 align:middle line:84%
So the closest analog you
can define in field theory--

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.010 align:middle line:90%


00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.500 align:middle line:90%
closest-- sorry, not closed--

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:35.230 align:middle line:84%
closest analog in QFT in
field theory is this object.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:41.090 align:middle line:84%
So let's define an object
x could be defined by--

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.970 align:middle line:84%
so again, whenever I
write something like x,

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.300 align:middle line:84%
you should view this as a
shorthand for the full vector

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.150 align:middle line:90%
including both space and time.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And so this second,
define an object by this--

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:59.580 align:middle line:84%
acting-- let's just consider--
suppose we have a real scalar

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:00.750 align:middle line:90%
field theory.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.960 align:middle line:84%
So for example, let's just
consider real scalar field

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.460 align:middle line:90%
theory.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.830 align:middle line:84%
So we can define an
object like this.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:10.530 align:middle line:84%
So this is the closest we can
get into a position eigenstate.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.410 align:middle line:90%


00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.520 align:middle line:90%
And then-- yeah, its conjugate.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.020 align:middle line:90%
Then it's given by phi.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.790 align:middle line:84%
So phi is a hermitian,
because it's real,

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.440 align:middle line:90%
so it's a hermitian operator.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.790 align:middle line:84%
So now, you can check
this object by definition

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:30.120 align:middle line:84%
because phi is a scalar
field will transforms nicely

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.679 align:middle line:90%
on the Lorentz transformation.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:37.309 align:middle line:84%
And the vacuum is invariant
under Lorentz transformation.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And so this object
actually transforms nicely.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:48.830 align:middle line:84%
So under Lorentz transformation,
x actually it goes to lambda x.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:53.590 align:middle line:84%
So this object actually
transforms nicely.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.760 align:middle line:90%


00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.730 align:middle line:84%
But you can also ask, what is
the overlap between these two

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.900 align:middle line:84%
such kind of position eigenstate
if we call this quoted position

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.520 align:middle line:90%
eigenstate?

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.910 align:middle line:84%
So now let's
consider the overlap

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.210 align:middle line:90%
between two such states.

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.940 align:middle line:90%
And then this will be given by--

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:20.460 align:middle line:84%
from this definition will
be given by 0 phi x and phi

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.790 align:middle line:90%
x prime on there.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:29.540 align:middle line:90%


00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's given by the
expectation value of x times phi

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.950 align:middle line:84%
x prime between
the vacuum states

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.440 align:middle line:90%
just from the definition.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.410 align:middle line:84%
So the reason we say
this is the closest

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:48.420 align:middle line:84%
analog is because even
though this state is

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Lorentz covariant, but this
state is not localized.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So if you want a
state to be localized,

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.550 align:middle line:84%
this has to be proportional
to delta function

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.830 align:middle line:84%
when you take the
them at the same time.

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.210 align:middle line:90%
But now you can show--

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.870 align:middle line:84%
so this is the object we
can compute explicitly,

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:10.650 align:middle line:84%
because we already
solved the phi completely

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.060 align:middle line:90%
in terms of a and a dagger.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.510 align:middle line:84%
You can just plug-in here to
compute this object explicitly,

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:21.210 align:middle line:84%
and we will do a towards
the end of today's lecture.

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Here, let me just
tell you the results.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.400 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that
this guy actually

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:32.850 align:middle line:84%
is non-zero for t
equal to t prime

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:37.740 align:middle line:90%
and x not equal to x prime.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.160 align:middle line:84%
So that means this is not--
this means that this cannot be

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.250 align:middle line:90%
a delta function.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:45.180 align:middle line:84%
So when you evaluate
them at the same time,

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.140 align:middle line:84%
if it's a localized
state, then it should be

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.240 align:middle line:90%
proportional to delta function.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.520 align:middle line:90%
But this is not the case.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:56.410 align:middle line:84%
So this object is
not quite localized,

00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:01.000 align:middle line:84%
but we will see actually in
some sense, it's localized,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.570 align:middle line:84%
and we will see in what
sense later when we

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:08.210 align:middle line:90%
compute this object explicitly.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.580 align:middle line:84%
So right now, let's
just say the conclusion

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.250 align:middle line:90%
that this is not localized.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.900 align:middle line:90%
So this is not--

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.305 align:middle line:84%
so this means this is
not a localized state.

00:11:18.305 --> 00:11:37.020 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.630 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:44.380 align:middle line:90%
So heuristically, we can say--

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:52.915 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so let me just
make a side remark here.

00:11:52.915 --> 00:11:58.790 align:middle line:90%


00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:03.880 align:middle line:84%
So if we-- so as we say, this
is not a position eigenstate.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.660 align:middle line:84%
But if we treat it as
some kind of approximation

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.270 align:middle line:84%
to the position
eigenstate, and then we

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:16.180 align:middle line:84%
can talk about the wave
function of a particle.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.580 align:middle line:90%
So now let's suppose--

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:31.860 align:middle line:84%
so given a single
particle state, psi--

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.700 align:middle line:84%
so psi would be say some
kind of superposition,

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.190 align:middle line:90%
which we wrote last time--

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:41.120 align:middle line:84%
so some arbitrary superposition
of the single particle state

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.590 align:middle line:90%
integrate over the momentum.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And then we can define
its wave function.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:52.420 align:middle line:90%


00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:58.980 align:middle line:84%
So I put this
function as a quote

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:07.180 align:middle line:84%
as psi x equal to just
overlap between the psi

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.950 align:middle line:90%
and this x object.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And then this is given by
just from that definition--

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:23.590 align:middle line:90%
just given by 0 phi x psi.

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:29.990 align:middle line:90%
So we can define a function--

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.630 align:middle line:84%
so this is closest analog
you can define a wave

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.980 align:middle line:84%
function for particle
in the field theory

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.360 align:middle line:90%
is to use this object.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.110 align:middle line:90%


00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.150 align:middle line:90%
And now, you can check--

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:47.530 align:middle line:84%
so it's a very simple exercise
for you to check yourself.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:51.370 align:middle line:84%
So if I just take this to
be the pure momentum state--

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:57.850 align:middle line:84%
say, for example, if I take
psi to be the pure momentum

00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.260 align:middle line:90%
state of k--

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:04.810 align:middle line:84%
remember, this notation k
is the square root 2 omega

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.950 align:middle line:90%
k on this state.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is the pure
momentum state.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And then if you calculate this
object, and then you get--

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:23.230 align:middle line:84%
then k x then just
becomes 0 phi x k.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:24.460 align:middle line:90%
Now, you can again--

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.980 align:middle line:84%
you know explicitly
how phi expressed

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.110 align:middle line:84%
in terms of a and
a dagger, and you

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:32.230 align:middle line:84%
know how this is
obtained from the vacuum

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:90%
by acting a dagger on it.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.680 align:middle line:84%
You can just
compute this object.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.020 align:middle line:90%
So take a couple of minutes.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And you can also just
essentially guess the answer.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.065 align:middle line:84%
So this just gives
you the plane wave--

00:14:44.065 --> 00:14:47.470 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.720 align:middle line:84%
just gives you an
initial plane wave.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:54.640 align:middle line:84%
So with your energy
are given by omega k.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.080 align:middle line:84%
So you just get the
plane wave function.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.287 align:middle line:84%
So in this sense, it's
like a wave function.

00:14:59.287 --> 00:15:01.120 align:middle line:84%
It makes sense to call
it the wave function.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:06.915 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.915 --> 00:15:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:12.090 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So in this state here,
we call this the wave function.

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:13.770 align:middle line:84%
If we take it, and
you multiply it

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:16.040 align:middle line:90%
by its own complex transpose--

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.480 align:middle line:84%
can we interpret it
as a probability?

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.420 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, this is the
comment I'm going to make now.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, this is a good question.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:26.610 align:middle line:90%
So we cannot really--

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:31.560 align:middle line:90%
so we cannot-- so in general--

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:49.850 align:middle line:84%
so psi x prime, in general,
cannot be interpreted as giving

00:15:49.850 --> 00:16:05.445 align:middle line:84%
the probability of
the particle at x.

00:16:05.445 --> 00:16:12.060 align:middle line:90%


00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.270 align:middle line:84%
So the reason we cannot do
that is because this is not--

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.995 align:middle line:84%
because x is not the
genuine position eigenstate.

00:16:18.995 --> 00:16:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And also in quantum
field theory,

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.730 align:middle line:90%
we don't really have this--

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:26.450 align:middle line:84%
we don't really have this
proper sense of talking about--

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:30.470 align:middle line:84%
you cannot really-- in general,
you cannot separate the single

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.230 align:middle line:84%
particle with multiple
particle exactly, in general,

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.910 align:middle line:90%
in quantum field theory.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:40.320 align:middle line:84%
In free theory, you can because
there is no interaction.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:90%
But in general, you cannot.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.280 align:middle line:84%
So the reason this
is a side remark

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.160 align:middle line:84%
is that this is
often used by people,

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.390 align:middle line:84%
and they just call
it a wave function.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:54.920 align:middle line:84%
But you should
keep in mind what's

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.640 align:middle line:84%
the content of this
object, and it's not

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.510 align:middle line:84%
something you can
actually rigorously define

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:06.380 align:middle line:84%
both mathematically and
physically as a wave function.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:11.290 align:middle line:90%


00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:12.405 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:17:12.405 --> 00:17:14.905 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.905 --> 00:17:16.280 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So could
you explain how

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.430 align:middle line:90%
you got e to the negative i?

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:21.819 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Oh, you
just calculate.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:24.609 align:middle line:90%


00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:28.300 align:middle line:84%
But it's very easy to see how
you get that because remember,

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.070 align:middle line:90%
phi x is--

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:36.440 align:middle line:84%
phi x can be expanded in terms
of a u plus a dagger u star.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And the k is obtained
by a dagger acting on 0.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, just a and a dagger
part, and give you this object,

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and a part proportional to
u, and that's how you get it.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.570 align:middle line:90%


00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:53.070 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:57.780 align:middle line:90%


00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:02.310 align:middle line:84%
So when we compute
this object explicitly,

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.700 align:middle line:84%
you will get a
more precise sense

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:10.470 align:middle line:84%
what I mean that this
is an approximation.

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.340 align:middle line:84%
You will get a
more precise sense.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.610 align:middle line:90%
And so this--

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.548 align:middle line:84%
I'll now defer that a
little bit because I

00:18:16.548 --> 00:18:18.215 align:middle line:84%
want to talk about
something else first.

00:18:18.215 --> 00:18:21.690 align:middle line:90%


00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:22.190 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.030 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:27.400 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:32.760 align:middle line:84%
So here-- so this actually
is a very important object.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.680 align:middle line:90%
Forget about this definition.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.730 align:middle line:84%
So this object-- yeah, let me
just write this object again.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.570 align:middle line:90%
So this G plus--

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:49.010 align:middle line:84%
so this object 0 phi
x and phi x prime 0--

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:58.190 align:middle line:84%
so we motivated as this
overlap between these two

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.050 align:middle line:90%
localized states--

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.697 align:middle line:84%
these two approximate
localized states.

00:19:02.697 --> 00:19:04.280 align:middle line:84%
But in quantum field
theory, actually,

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:09.380 align:middle line:84%
this is a very important object,
and actually, we normally

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:13.760 align:middle line:84%
assign a rotation G
plus with this object.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And so the application
of this object,

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:19.430 align:middle line:84%
we will not talk
too much about it.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.860 align:middle line:90%
But in condensed matter--

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.140 align:middle line:84%
for example, say
in phi, describes

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.990 align:middle line:84%
some approximate-- some
continuum description of a spin

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.770 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And then this would be
measure the correlation

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.470 align:middle line:84%
between the spins at
different locations--

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.450 align:middle line:84%
at different locations
and different time.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:37.733 align:middle line:84%
So this is what people call
the correlation functions.

00:19:37.733 --> 00:19:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And so in condensed matter, this
actually plays a very important

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.520 align:middle line:84%
role, and matches
the correlation

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.450 align:middle line:84%
between different
physical objects.

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:50.825 align:middle line:90%
And so here-- so when x--

00:19:50.825 --> 00:19:54.340 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:59.920 align:middle line:84%
for x and x prime,
at non-equal time--

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:05.460 align:middle line:90%


00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:11.670 align:middle line:84%
in general, phi x and phi
x prime do not commute.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:16.270 align:middle line:90%


00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Remember our
commutation relation--

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.800 align:middle line:84%
canonical commutation
relation is phi--

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.050 align:middle line:84%
phi x and phi x
prime, they commute

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:25.300 align:middle line:90%
when they at equal time.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.620 align:middle line:84%
When they are not
equal time, in general,

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.320 align:middle line:90%
they don't have to commute.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.740 align:middle line:84%
So the ordering here
is actually important.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:45.940 align:middle line:84%
So the ordering of phi in G
plus is actually important.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:52.120 align:middle line:90%


00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.410 align:middle line:90%
So if I define some--

00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:00.380 align:middle line:84%
I can consider a lot of objects
with a different ordering.

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Say if I put the
phi x prime first,

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:07.720 align:middle line:84%
I can also consider this object
for the phi x prime first.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.720 align:middle line:90%


00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.460 align:middle line:90%
So this is normally called--

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:15.830 align:middle line:84%
now, this is a different
function in general

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.860 align:middle line:84%
because they don't commute
and we call it G minus.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:25.090 align:middle line:90%


00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:29.570 align:middle line:84%
So this is also
appropriately just x prime x.

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:34.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is the x
prime x and this is

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:39.950 align:middle line:90%
using that notation is x prime.

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:43.865 align:middle line:84%
And so in general, G plus and
G minus, they are not the same.

00:21:43.865 --> 00:21:46.520 align:middle line:90%


00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So you can also define
some other functions--

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:57.520 align:middle line:84%
say since the phi and phi x
and phi x prime don't commute,

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.720 align:middle line:90%
then you say--

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.810 align:middle line:84%
then we can consider
more general orderings.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.840 align:middle line:84%
We can consider the
superposition of these two.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So you can consider the
retarded function so-called,

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:18.120 align:middle line:84%
which is defined to be the
theta t minus t prime--

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.110 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:25.610 align:middle line:84%
the commutator of phi
x and phi x prime.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:28.670 align:middle line:90%


00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:33.040 align:middle line:84%
So this is some other
object you can define,

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.220 align:middle line:84%
which is the difference
between the two,

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:41.320 align:middle line:84%
but it only takes value when
t is greater than t prime.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.930 align:middle line:84%
So when t is smaller than
t prime, then it's 0.

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So this is another other
object we often use.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And so this often is denoted
by theta t minus t prime,

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:57.180 align:middle line:84%
and call this object-- this
commutator to be delta t,

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:00.420 align:middle line:90%
t prime.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.600 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, people also
use the following object--

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:10.440 align:middle line:84%
the G A equal to minus
t, t prime minus t.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.590 align:middle line:84%
So only it's non-zero
when t prime is

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:16.170 align:middle line:90%
greater than t and the delta.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:16.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sorry.

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Here, it should be x, x prime.

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:25.440 align:middle line:90%


00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And finally, you
can define an object

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:31.920 align:middle line:90%
called G F which is half--

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.390 align:middle line:90%
so this is called the retarded.

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:35.670 align:middle line:84%
This is called
advanced, which is

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.760 align:middle line:84%
like half of the retarded
and half advanced.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:44.450 align:middle line:84%
So when t greater than t
prime, you take the G plus.

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:90%
And when t is greater than--

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.390 align:middle line:90%
t prime greater than t--

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:51.650 align:middle line:90%
let me do it here--

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:58.810 align:middle line:90%


00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:00.190 align:middle line:90%
you do G minus.

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:03.700 align:middle line:90%


00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Again, this G F is a
function of x and x prime.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:09.850 align:middle line:90%


00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So because they don't commute,
so these are various objects

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.140 align:middle line:90%
you can define.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:15.940 align:middle line:90%
So one second.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:20.680 align:middle line:84%
So at the moment, they may seem
not very intuitive to you--

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.650 align:middle line:84%
why should we be worried
about those objects.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And later, you will see
actually some of those objects

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:33.190 align:middle line:84%
play a very important role,
and some of these objects

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:36.960 align:middle line:90%
will play a very important role.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, for now, they're
just some definitions which

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.840 align:middle line:90%
we will use potentially later.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:47.610 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So considering spins
on a lattice, would x and x

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:52.000 align:middle line:84%
prime be the positions of
the spins on the lattice?

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.940 align:middle line:84%
So why would it physically
differ one I define which--

00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.430 align:middle line:84%
it seems arbitrary
to switch them right?

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:03.320 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, if you
do them at equal time,

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.260 align:middle line:90%
then it doesn't matter.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.030 align:middle line:84%
But remember, x
and x prime, they

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:11.230 align:middle line:84%
don't have the same time, and if
they're not at the same time--

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:13.690 align:middle line:84%
and then actually, sometimes,
the ordering matters.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, whether you do this
measurement first, and then

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:19.150 align:middle line:84%
you wait a while to
do that measurement,

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:22.060 align:middle line:84%
or you do this measurement
first and then-- yeah,

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:25.230 align:middle line:90%
then that can be different.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:26.175 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:25:26.175 --> 00:25:30.110 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So G minus is
x' inner product with x?

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:31.922 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:25:31.922 --> 00:25:34.695 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: G plus just uh,
wouldn't it just be--

00:25:34.695 --> 00:25:36.320 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, just
they're switched.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, remember this
order is important.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So here, I have x first
and x prime second.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:50.260 align:middle line:90%
So this order is different--

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:51.190 align:middle line:90%
is important.

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:52.957 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: But is G minus then
just the complex congugate

00:25:52.957 --> 00:25:53.400 align:middle line:90%
of G plus?

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.692 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it is the
complex congugate of G plus.

00:25:55.692 --> 00:25:59.703 align:middle line:90%


00:25:59.703 --> 00:26:00.370 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:00.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.148 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Yeah, so like the
retarded and advanced ones

00:26:03.148 --> 00:26:08.440 align:middle line:84%
aren't like Lorentz covariant
because of the theta function?

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.980 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, we
will talk about that.

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:17.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they are actually.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.289 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:26:18.289 --> 00:26:20.247 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Can you go back
and explain more about

00:26:20.247 --> 00:26:22.970 align:middle line:84%
why the non-equal time
non-equal position

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:25.590 align:middle line:90%
operators don't commute?

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:30.070 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it
just say our canonical--

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:32.110 align:middle line:84%
yeah, our canonical
commutation relation

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:36.660 align:middle line:84%
only requires them to
commute at the equal time.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And when they are not equal
time, and each of them

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.090 align:middle line:90%
will evolve.

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the
phi itself is--

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.080 align:middle line:90%
phi itself depends on time.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so let me just--

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:54.472 align:middle line:90%
if I just write the--

00:26:54.472 --> 00:26:57.360 align:middle line:90%


00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.160 align:middle line:90%
yeah, let me just write the--

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:10.230 align:middle line:84%
so this is the k, say a k u k
plus a k dagger u k dagger u k

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:12.570 align:middle line:90%
star.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:15.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is my
expression for phi.

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:17.900 align:middle line:90%


00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.970 align:middle line:84%
So canonical
commutation relation

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:24.620 align:middle line:84%
only requires that they are
equal when t equal to t prime.

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:26.600 align:middle line:84%
But when t is not
equal to t prime,

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.160 align:middle line:84%
I just have some
general expression.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.980 align:middle line:84%
I do the commutator-- does
not guarantee you will get 0.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.688 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you just get--

00:27:33.688 --> 00:27:34.980 align:middle line:90%
yeah, you have different terms.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:38.540 align:middle line:90%
They may not cancel each other.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.140 align:middle line:84%
So at t equal to 0, we guarantee
that they cancel each other,

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.647 align:middle line:84%
but when t is not
equal to 0, then not

00:27:44.647 --> 00:27:45.980 align:middle line:90%
guaranteed to cancel each other.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:49.280 align:middle line:84%
But we will figure out when
they cancel, will not cancel.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we will talk about
that more explicitly.

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:53.117 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:27:53.117 --> 00:27:55.367 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Is it correct that
if the point are spacelike

00:27:55.367 --> 00:27:58.510 align:middle line:84%
separated then we can
rotate so that t --

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:01.155 align:middle line:90%
to a frame where t --?

00:28:01.155 --> 00:28:02.780 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, we
will talk about it.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:03.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah--

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.750 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:08.130 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, we
will talk about that.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:09.900 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:13.770 align:middle line:84%
So let me just emphasize again,
this is something in principle

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:15.180 align:middle line:90%
you can define.

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's phys-- some of its
meaning will be clear later.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And in the next pset-- not in
this pset-- in the next p set,

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:27.480 align:middle line:84%
you will see an example,
which this thing actually

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.900 align:middle line:90%
play a very important role.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:32.700 align:middle line:84%
So this is the analog of the
retarded function in E and M?

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Do you still remember
retarded function E and M?

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, so this is quantum
version of this retarded

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:43.080 align:middle line:84%
function in E and M. And
you will see application

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.810 align:middle line:90%
of this in the pset four.

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And later, we will use
this thing all the time.

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.630 align:middle line:84%
So this G F, we will
use it all the time

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:54.960 align:middle line:84%
when we consider interactions,
and so that's why

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.300 align:middle line:90%
we want to introduce it here.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And this G plus G minus are
called the Wightman functions.

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:07.558 align:middle line:90%


00:29:07.558 --> 00:29:09.350 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, called
the Wightman function.

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:11.790 align:middle line:84%
The G F is called
the Feynman function.

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:15.210 align:middle line:84%
So Feynman was the first
person who introduced it.

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:20.200 align:middle line:90%


00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, so G plus G minus
was introduced by other people,

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:30.510 align:middle line:84%
but Wightman made many
important use of it

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.260 align:middle line:84%
in the early days of
quantum field theory,

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.802 align:middle line:84%
so it's called the
Wightman function.

00:29:33.802 --> 00:29:37.460 align:middle line:90%


00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.950 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's just study a
little bit the properties

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:41.360 align:middle line:90%
of those functions.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:46.820 align:middle line:84%
So you can also think these
are essentially the simplest

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:49.130 align:middle line:90%
observables of the system.

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, if you
think of them as correlation

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:53.660 align:middle line:84%
functions, and then
that just tells you

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.270 align:middle line:84%
the correlation between the
phi at a different point.

00:29:56.270 --> 00:30:00.770 align:middle line:84%
So this is in some sense,
also the simplest observables

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:03.580 align:middle line:90%
in your theory.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:04.080 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.390 align:middle line:90%
Do you have other questions?

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:07.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.418 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So this
is the correlation

00:30:09.418 --> 00:30:12.570 align:middle line:90%
for the vacuum state, right?

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:15.276 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, this is the
correlation vacuum state.

00:30:15.276 --> 00:30:19.350 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So you have
a different state?

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:21.850 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, if you're not
in a vacuum state, of course,

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:23.070 align:middle line:90%
you get a different function.

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:27.460 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So is there a way
to measure for other states?

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.320 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
you can compute.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:33.220 align:middle line:84%
So in this theory, we
can compute in any state.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:37.345 align:middle line:84%
But just we often use -- we
probe in the vacuum state.

00:30:37.345 --> 00:30:40.970 align:middle line:90%


00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:42.550 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, for example,
in the lab, if you

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.390 align:middle line:84%
can prepare in
some whatever state

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:54.060 align:middle line:84%
you prepare, you calculate
this object in that state,

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.800 align:middle line:84%
but the vacuum is
the simplest one.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:56.620 align:middle line:90%
It's the simplest.

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:00.096 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
we can, we can

00:31:00.096 --> 00:31:02.576 align:middle line:84%
define a useful
localized state in space

00:31:02.576 --> 00:31:05.056 align:middle line:84%
and [INAUDIBLE] other
[? state ?] defined

00:31:05.056 --> 00:31:14.000 align:middle line:84%
is also [INAUDIBLE],, spacetime
is useful [INAUDIBLE]??

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.750 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, it's
not quite in spacetime.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:20.230 align:middle line:84%
We will see in what sense
it's approximate to the local

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.730 align:middle line:90%
in space.

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:27.050 align:middle line:90%


00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:27.550 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's just discuss the
property of those objects.

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And so the first
thing is that the--

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:52.145 align:middle line:84%
remember the phi satisfy
the following equation.

00:31:52.145 --> 00:31:54.950 align:middle line:90%


00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:59.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is the operating
equation satisfy phi.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:06.330 align:middle line:90%
And so if you act this on the--

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:07.860 align:middle line:90%
so suppose this is--

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.870 align:middle line:84%
so here, you have
two arg-- here,

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:12.850 align:middle line:84%
you have two arguments,
x and x prime.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:14.730 align:middle line:84%
So here, when we write
differential operator,

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:16.080 align:middle line:90%
we always refer to x.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.050 align:middle line:90%
It's always derivative of x.

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:22.070 align:middle line:84%
So we must satisfy
this equation.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:25.930 align:middle line:84%
So if you act this on the
G plus and the G minus,

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:27.670 align:middle line:90%
you immediately get 0.

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:30.820 align:middle line:84%
So you find-- because
of [INAUDIBLE] equation,

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:35.980 align:middle line:84%
then G plus/minus are just
x and x prime immediately

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:40.030 align:middle line:84%
gives you 0 just because
phi satisfies this equation.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Oh, sorry, it should be
a minus sign, I think.

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.250 align:middle line:90%
And similarly, with this--

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:48.218 align:middle line:84%
similarly with delta--
so the delta is

00:32:48.218 --> 00:32:49.510 align:middle line:90%
the difference between the two.

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:50.680 align:middle line:90%
It's the commutator.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.595 align:middle line:84%
So the delta is essentially the
difference between G plus and G

00:32:54.595 --> 00:32:57.160 align:middle line:84%
minus, so the same
thing with delta.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:15.730 align:middle line:90%


00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:17.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- the
first property is

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:21.070 align:middle line:84%
that they satisfy
the same equation

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:24.790 align:middle line:84%
as the classical
equations of phi.

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:26.680 align:middle line:84%
So the G plus and
delta, they satisfy.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.260 align:middle line:90%


00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:30.310 align:middle line:90%
And we will talk--

00:33:30.310 --> 00:34:07.320 align:middle line:84%
and then you can now also
look at the G F and the G R.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:14.540 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you act this
object on G R, G A, or G F,

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:18.150 align:middle line:84%
the story is a little bit tricky
because the partial square

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:20.040 align:middle line:90%
containing time derivatives.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And when you add the time
derivatives-- and time

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:25.415 align:middle line:84%
derivatives do act on
those theta functions.

00:34:25.415 --> 00:34:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And when you add time
derivative on theta function,

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.250 align:middle line:84%
you will get some delta
functions, et cetera.

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And so the story is a
little bit more intricate.

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:38.219 align:middle line:84%
But if you just
carry it through--

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:40.940 align:middle line:84%
it just carries through--
then you can show.

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:43.489 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a
simple exercise you

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:45.020 align:middle line:90%
should try to show yourself--

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.699 align:middle line:90%
we'll not do it here--

00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:55.920 align:middle line:84%
that you find, you
act this on the G R A,

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and F. You get actually
the-- any of them,

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.800 align:middle line:90%
you get the same equation.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.710 align:middle line:84%
You get the right-hand
side becomes--

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:08.770 align:middle line:84%
it's non-zero-- actually
gives you a delta function.

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:10.930 align:middle line:84%
So this is a four-dimensional
delta function.

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:13.155 align:middle line:84%
So in both in spatial
location and in time.

00:35:13.155 --> 00:35:19.520 align:middle line:90%


00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.340 align:middle line:84%
So heuristically,
you can understand

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:24.530 align:middle line:84%
that this delta
function in time comes

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:31.670 align:middle line:84%
from taking derivative
on theta functions

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:40.330 align:middle line:84%
and then the derivative
in the spatial direction--

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:43.330 align:middle line:84%
oh, delta function in
the spatial direction

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:46.190 align:middle line:84%
can come out in
the following way.

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:48.590 align:middle line:90%
So here, you have two--

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:50.360 align:middle line:84%
so here, you have
two time derivatives

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:51.890 align:middle line:90%
right in the partial square.

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:56.000 align:middle line:84%
So imagine you have one time
derivative acting on the theta

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.910 align:middle line:84%
function, and then give you
a delta function in time.

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And then if you have one time
derivative acting on this phi,

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.510 align:middle line:90%
and then taking it into pi.

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And then equal time
commutator then

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:13.110 align:middle line:84%
give you a delta function
in the spatial direction,

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:16.370 align:middle line:90%
and so that's how you get that.

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but it's easy
to check yourself.

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:21.650 align:middle line:84%
So this is the first
property-- is that they

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:23.370 align:middle line:90%
satisfy those nice equations.

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:26.170 align:middle line:90%


00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:32.560 align:middle line:84%
The second property is
that phi x and phi x prime,

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:35.110 align:middle line:84%
even though in general
they don't commute,

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:46.110 align:middle line:84%
but they actually commute
for space-like separations.

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:51.420 align:middle line:90%


00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So that means that if you
look at the commutator of phi

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:59.040 align:middle line:84%
x and phi x prime,
this is actually

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:06.220 align:middle line:84%
equal to 0 for x minus x prime
greater than square greater

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:10.170 align:middle line:84%
than 0 for space-like
separations.

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:14.160 align:middle line:90%


00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:17.680 align:middle line:84%
So this can be checked by
expression computation.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.130 align:middle line:84%
So we know the mode
expression of phi.

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:22.370 align:middle line:90%
You can just do it commutator--

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:25.140 align:middle line:90%
yeah, you can just check it.

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:26.910 align:middle line:90%
But you can also--

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:29.640 align:middle line:84%
but there's also a simple
argument to make it.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:33.200 align:middle line:90%


00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:39.590 align:middle line:84%
So you can do-- you can check
by expression computation.

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:46.790 align:middle line:90%


00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:48.695 align:middle line:84%
So here, I give you
alternative argument.

00:37:48.695 --> 00:37:56.310 align:middle line:90%


00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Here, I give you an
alternative derivation.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:05.650 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's very simple,
but let me just divide it

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.615 align:middle line:90%
into three small steps.

00:38:07.615 --> 00:38:10.480 align:middle line:90%


00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.910 align:middle line:90%
So essentially, by definition--

00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:15.490 align:middle line:84%
so let's just
consider-- yeah, we

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:19.840 align:middle line:84%
consider the commutator, which
here we call to be delta.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.850 align:middle line:90%
So the delta x plus/minus--

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:25.570 align:middle line:84%
oh, x and x prime,
which is the commutator.

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:28.210 align:middle line:90%


00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:30.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let me define--

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:34.090 align:middle line:84%
yeah, sorry--
yeah, so delta here

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:39.550 align:middle line:84%
is the expectation value of 0,
so let me call this delta hat.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So the delta hat is defined
to be the commutator.

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:49.790 align:middle line:90%


00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:52.490 align:middle line:84%
So the first claim is that
this is actually a C number.

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:57.520 align:middle line:90%


00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:03.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is C number, and
the reason is very simple.

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:06.960 align:middle line:84%
So just some constant-- even if
it's non-zero can, at the most,

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.670 align:middle line:90%
be a constant.

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Be some-- yeah,
but C number means

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:14.490 align:middle line:90%
that it's not an operator.

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:16.530 align:middle line:84%
So the reason this
is C number is

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:21.090 align:middle line:84%
because if you look at the phi,
it's linear in a and a dagger.

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:25.410 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the commutator
between phi and phi itself,

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:28.980 align:middle line:84%
you always just get commuted
between a and a dagger.

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:32.490 align:middle line:84%
a and a dagger just
give you a constant,

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:37.280 align:middle line:84%
and so this just--
you get some C number.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So in fact-- so this delta hat
is actually the same as delta

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.760 align:middle line:84%
because the, if
your C number, you

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.760 align:middle line:84%
take this expectation
value doesn't do anything.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.470 align:middle line:90%


00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:56.010 align:middle line:84%
So the second step is that
now let's consider the Lorentz

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:57.810 align:middle line:90%
transformation--

00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:02.190 align:middle line:84%
the operator, which generates
the Lorentz transformation,

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:04.460 align:middle line:90%
which is given by--

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:06.810 align:middle line:84%
remember, we
discussed last time.

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:11.220 align:middle line:90%


00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.520 align:middle line:90%
So this is the generator.

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:16.900 align:middle line:84%
So this is the unitary--
so this is operator

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.069 align:middle line:90%
of Lorentz transformation.

00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:25.670 align:middle line:90%


00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:29.770 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at this object.

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:31.330 align:middle line:90%
And then by definition--

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:34.120 align:middle line:90%


00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:40.800 align:middle line:84%
so this object acting
on phi x dagger

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:44.250 align:middle line:90%
will give you phi prime x.

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And phi prime x transforms
phi under the Lorentz

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:48.840 align:middle line:84%
transformation, and
this is the same

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:52.600 align:middle line:84%
as you just do an
inverse Lorentz transform

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.250 align:middle line:90%
on the coordinates.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:57.420 align:middle line:90%
So this is the--

00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:59.730 align:middle line:90%
so by the way, just--

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:03.340 align:middle line:84%
do you feel comfortable
about this equation?

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Do you know where this
equation comes from?

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.580 align:middle line:84%
So you're all
comfortable with this?

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:08.180 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:15.110 align:middle line:90%


00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So by definition, U
acts on phi as this.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.560 align:middle line:90%
So now, let's just act both--

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:25.835 align:middle line:84%
act U and U lambda dagger on
both sides of this equation.

00:41:25.835 --> 00:41:32.800 align:middle line:90%


00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.240 align:middle line:90%
And then we get--

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:37.320 align:middle line:90%
so on the right-hand side--

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:41.990 align:middle line:84%
so this is a unitary operator
-- because the M is Hermitian,

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:43.370 align:middle line:90%
this is a unitary operator.

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:46.100 align:middle line:84%
So the right-hand side, you
just go back to this C number.

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:47.900 align:middle line:90%
It does not change.

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.670 align:middle line:90%
So the equation does not change.

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:53.250 align:middle line:90%
And the left-hand side--

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:56.270 align:middle line:90%
so the delta is the same.

00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:57.875 align:middle line:90%
So you find that the--

00:41:57.875 --> 00:42:01.100 align:middle line:90%


00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:06.020 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so you find the
delta x prime, which

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:07.400 align:middle line:90%
is equal to this C number.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Then, it's the same as
U Lambda phi x phi x

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:18.050 align:middle line:90%
prime and the U lambda dagger.

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And that gives
you-- me phi lambda

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:27.810 align:middle line:84%
minus 1 x commutator with phi
lambda 1-- minus 1 x prime.

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:31.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's the same
as delta lambda

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.240 align:middle line:90%
x and the lambda x prime.

00:42:33.240 --> 00:43:09.590 align:middle line:90%


00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:10.970 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:16.170 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can look
at the last step.

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:19.730 align:middle line:84%
So you see, when we make
a Lorentz transformation

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:22.580 align:middle line:84%
on delta, actually
nothing changes,

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:26.400 align:middle line:84%
and the value is the same
because the commutator is a C

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:26.900 align:middle line:90%
number.

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.610 align:middle line:90%


00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And then-- now remember for any
space-like separated x and x

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:56.440 align:middle line:84%
prime, we can always choose
to find the some lambda--

00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:03.820 align:middle line:84%
some Lorentz transformation--
that the lambda

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:14.570 align:middle line:84%
x and the lambda x prime
to be at the equal time.

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:15.990 align:middle line:90%
They have the same time.

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:17.670 align:middle line:84%
We can always make
a transformation.

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and let me call it
something else-- t tilde.

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:24.720 align:middle line:90%
So your original x is for--

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:28.460 align:middle line:84%
you can always transform
it to equal time.

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And then according to this one,
then will be identically 0.

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And then we find delta
x and x prime equal

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:49.860 align:middle line:84%
to 0, because now, this is
evaluated at equal time.

00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:53.180 align:middle line:90%
So this is very intuitive.

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:57.350 align:middle line:84%
When you make a Lorentz
transformation, you can--

00:44:57.350 --> 00:45:02.060 align:middle line:84%
yeah-- but this is a precise
proof of the statement.

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.830 align:middle line:90%


00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:07.090 align:middle line:90%
Any questions on this?

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:08.281 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:45:08.281 --> 00:45:10.165 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: What's the
x on [INAUDIBLE]??

00:45:10.165 --> 00:45:13.302 align:middle line:90%


00:45:13.302 --> 00:45:14.010 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:17.760 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:22.370 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, for x minus x
prime squared greater than 0.

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:24.000 align:middle line:84%
So this is a four
distance square.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.620 align:middle line:84%
You're asking about
this notation?

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:27.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, this is just--

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.510 align:middle line:90%
there are four distance square--

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:33.360 align:middle line:90%
the separation between them.

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.062 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:45:35.062 --> 00:45:37.370 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: I have a question
on the first property.

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:40.400 align:middle line:84%
So is that equation
up in the corner,

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.390 align:middle line:84%
so that defines
the-- it says that G

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:47.133 align:middle line:84%
is like the Green's function
for your Klein-Gordon operator?

00:45:47.133 --> 00:45:47.800 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.660 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: So why does that--

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:52.588 align:middle line:84%
is there an intuition for why
the correlator in the vacuum

00:45:52.588 --> 00:45:54.130 align:middle line:84%
state gives you the
Green's function?

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Because then you could use this
to get any classical solution

00:45:57.130 --> 00:45:57.940 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:02.260 align:middle line:90%


00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:06.820 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so the
intuition is that essentially--

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:10.840 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so for example,
this is just how we--

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:17.890 align:middle line:90%


00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:22.730 align:middle line:84%
yeah, first is that this kind
of thing is simple enough.

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:27.370 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, you can just see
by observation, but in a more

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:28.870 align:middle line:90%
complicated theory.

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually derive it--
and the retarded Green function

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:34.940 align:middle line:90%
always have this form.

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that's a thorough
more elaborate derivation.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:41.513 align:middle line:90%


00:46:41.513 --> 00:46:43.930 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: When you're talking
about classical field theory,

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:46.540 align:middle line:84%
usually solving the Green's
function is kind of hard

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:48.774 align:middle line:90%
and you have to expand--

00:46:48.774 --> 00:46:53.580 align:middle line:84%
like, here, we quantize
it and then got out--

00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:56.040 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
this is different.

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:58.500 align:middle line:84%
So classically, we just
define those functions

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.060 align:middle line:90%
using those equations.

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:03.660 align:middle line:90%
So here, we just say--

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:07.740 align:middle line:84%
in quantum field theory, the
object can be written this way.

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, those objects can
be written this way.

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And this definition just follows
from the standard-- yeah,

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:22.020 align:middle line:84%
if you do quantum mechanics
and you-- a retarded function

00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:23.805 align:middle line:90%
can always be written like this.

00:47:23.805 --> 00:47:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, this is also just
in quantum mechanics,

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.020 align:middle line:84%
but it requires a little bit
of calculation to see that.

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:31.720 align:middle line:90%


00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.070 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:33.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:36.637 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Should it
be lambda minus 1?

00:47:36.637 --> 00:47:37.470 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:37.860 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:39.027 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's-- lambda minus 1.

00:47:39.027 --> 00:47:42.570 align:middle line:90%


00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so here also
should be lambda minus 1.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.880 align:middle line:90%


00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:53.100 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:53.900 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:47:53.900 --> 00:48:00.310 align:middle line:90%


00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:04.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so this also shows--

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.950 align:middle line:90%


00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:11.640 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so when we talk about
the canonical quantization--

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:15.320 align:middle line:84%
so we mentioned that we need
to impose this equal time

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:19.460 align:middle line:90%
commutator to be 0.

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:21.770 align:middle line:84%
That's our canonical
commutation.

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we impose the canonical
commutation relation

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:26.135 align:middle line:90%
at a single time.

00:48:26.135 --> 00:48:29.730 align:middle line:90%


00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And some of you were
asking that actually--

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:36.680 align:middle line:84%
does that actually
break Lorentz symmetry

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.500 align:middle line:84%
because we have to
choose a single time?

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.240 align:middle line:84%
But now, you can
see actually this

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:44.180 align:middle line:84%
does not break Lorentz
symmetry because the only

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:48.120 align:middle line:84%
space-like separated, and the
commutator is always the same.

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:53.870 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what frame
you choose and the--

00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:58.070 align:middle line:84%
in any frame, if
it's equal time,

00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:00.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's always space-like
separated in some other frame.

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:07.240 align:middle line:90%


00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:07.740 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:14.260 align:middle line:90%


00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So that means-- so
immediate conclusion--

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:29.860 align:middle line:84%
it means that for
space-like separated,

00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:38.470 align:middle line:84%
x and x prime G plus equal
to G minus is equal to G F.

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:43.540 align:middle line:84%
So the time ordering does
not matter, so the G plus--

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:44.920 align:middle line:90%
then you can do G minus.

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And then the G F equal
to the sum of them.

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And then when-- here, it's
for t greater than t prime.

00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Here, it's for t
prime greater than t.

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And then this should
just add equal to 1

00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:59.630 align:middle line:84%
because these two
become the same.

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And the G R and the G A
equal to delta equal to 0

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.630 align:middle line:90%
for space-like surface case.

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:12.660 align:middle line:84%
So those functions
are pretty simple.

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:14.540 align:middle line:90%
So the-- yeah.

00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:22.930 align:middle line:90%


00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:28.070 align:middle line:90%
So now-- so the last property--

00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:37.610 align:middle line:84%
now, you can show due to
the spacetime translation

00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:52.470 align:middle line:84%
symmetry and the Lorentz
symmetry of the vacuum--

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:55.300 align:middle line:90%


00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:57.940 align:middle line:90%
of the vacuum state.

00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:00.270 align:middle line:90%
So you can show--

00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:02.850 align:middle line:90%
I think this will be--

00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:05.190 align:middle line:84%
this is a pretty
simple argument,

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:07.620 align:middle line:84%
but I will leave it
to show yourself.

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:12.680 align:middle line:84%
You can show that any
of those functions only

00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:16.580 align:middle line:84%
depend on the difference
between of them--

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:19.100 align:middle line:84%
and in particular, only
depend on the four distance

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:19.790 align:middle line:90%
between them.

00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:23.480 align:middle line:90%


00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And this G here can be any of
the G R, G A, G plus/minus,

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:35.590 align:middle line:90%
G F, et cetera.

00:51:35.590 --> 00:51:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So all of them have
very nice properties.

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Even naively depend
on two arguments.

00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:46.570 align:middle line:90%
So x have four components.

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:49.010 align:middle line:90%
x prime have four components.

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:52.890 align:middle line:84%
So naively, this is a
function of eight variables,

00:51:52.890 --> 00:51:56.760 align:middle line:84%
but this tells you once
you use all the symmetries,

00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:00.580 align:middle line:84%
this is actually a function
only a single variable.

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:02.440 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
powerful statement.

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So they have very--
yeah, so this answers one

00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:08.140 align:middle line:90%
of the question some--

00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:09.700 align:middle line:90%
one of you asked earlier--

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:13.510 align:middle line:84%
that the-- despite
the theta functions,

00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:16.330 align:middle line:84%
you can show that they still
have very nice properties

00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:17.740 align:middle line:90%
under Lorentz transformation.

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:19.930 align:middle line:84%
You can show they
have a nice properties

00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:21.628 align:middle line:90%
under Lorentz transformation.

00:52:21.628 --> 00:52:26.080 align:middle line:90%


00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:26.580 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:43.940 align:middle line:90%


00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:44.930 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:48.260 align:middle line:90%


00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:48.890 align:middle line:90%

STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:55.760 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
this is very easy.

00:52:55.760 --> 00:53:00.230 align:middle line:84%
When you have a translation
symmetry, and then

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:middle line:84%
the reference point
you choose is not--

00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:05.550 align:middle line:84%
you can choose any point
to be the reference point.

00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And so you can just
choose x, and then only

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:13.648 align:middle line:84%
the separation between x
and the x prime matters,

00:53:13.648 --> 00:53:15.690 align:middle line:84%
because you can just choose
x prime, for example,

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:16.760 align:middle line:90%
to be at the origin--

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.920 align:middle line:90%
and then only the separation.

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And then the Lorentz
symmetry tells you

00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:24.780 align:middle line:90%
that only the distance matters.

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:27.740 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter the direction.

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:28.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:30.407 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Does the commutator
have this property too,

00:53:30.407 --> 00:53:31.350 align:middle line:90%
or is it just G?

00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:33.683 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the commutator
also have this property.

00:53:33.683 --> 00:53:35.655 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the delta also
have this property.

00:53:35.655 --> 00:53:40.780 align:middle line:90%


00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:42.415 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:53:42.415 --> 00:53:44.665 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Is this only true
when x and x' are spacelike

00:53:44.665 --> 00:53:46.470 align:middle line:90%
separated?

00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:50.010 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: No, this
is true in general.

00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:54.340 align:middle line:84%
This is always true, but it's
only in the vacuum state.

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:56.892 align:middle line:84%
So the key is that
you have to use

00:53:56.892 --> 00:53:58.350 align:middle line:84%
that the vacuum
state are invariant

00:53:58.350 --> 00:54:00.015 align:middle line:90%
under those transformations.

00:54:00.015 --> 00:54:05.600 align:middle line:90%


00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's a-- once you
understand how to do it,

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:11.750 align:middle line:84%
it's a very simple argument,
so that's why I will leave it

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:14.780 align:middle line:90%
into one of the exercises.

00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:19.620 align:middle line:90%


00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:22.020 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:22.950 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:25.100 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's compute
this object G plus.

00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:29.160 align:middle line:90%


00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:30.850 align:middle line:90%
We have been talking about it.

00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And now, finally,
after discussing

00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:34.690 align:middle line:90%
all these general properties--

00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:36.750 align:middle line:84%
so let's compute
them explicitly.

00:54:36.750 --> 00:55:14.950 align:middle line:90%


00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:18.630 align:middle line:84%
So let's just first
compute the G plus.

00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Did I just erase the
definition of G plus?

00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:22.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:28.450 align:middle line:90%
So this is easy to do.

00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:33.030 align:middle line:84%
So those properties you
can just get by symmetries.

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you can also get by
doing explicit calculations,

00:55:37.890 --> 00:55:40.410 align:middle line:84%
but you can get them without
doing any explicit calculation

00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:42.165 align:middle line:90%
just based on symmetries.

00:55:42.165 --> 00:55:44.580 align:middle line:90%
So here, we do--

00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:46.080 align:middle line:84%
calculate this
object explicitly,

00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.380 align:middle line:84%
we will see-- satisfy
those properties.

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:52.600 align:middle line:90%


00:55:52.600 --> 00:56:01.900 align:middle line:84%
So we just put in the
expansion of phi and phi

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:03.040 align:middle line:90%
x and the phi x prime.

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:14.950 align:middle line:90%


00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And then-- yeah,
then we have the 0,

00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and then we have
a k u k evaluated

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:33.790 align:middle line:84%
at x plus a k dagger
u k star evaluated

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:42.820 align:middle line:84%
at x times a k prime
u k prime evaluated

00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:52.570 align:middle line:84%
at x prime plus a k prime dagger
u k prime star at x prime,

00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:55.240 align:middle line:90%
and then acting on 0.

00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:59.470 align:middle line:84%
So this decay with
2 omega k, and this

00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:01.610 align:middle line:90%
essentially gives you phi.

00:57:01.610 --> 00:57:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And the other one
gives you the phi--

00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:07.090 align:middle line:84%
so this gives you the
phi x, and this one

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:09.430 align:middle line:90%
gives you the phi x prime.

00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:11.110 align:middle line:90%
I just calculated this.

00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:15.630 align:middle line:90%


00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:17.230 align:middle line:90%
So now, this is easy to do.

00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:19.470 align:middle line:84%
This is just now
become an exercise

00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:21.700 align:middle line:90%
in harmonic oscillator.

00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:23.880 align:middle line:90%
So only this term--

00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:25.080 align:middle line:90%
multiply this term.

00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:27.060 align:middle line:90%
It's non-zero.

00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:31.620 align:middle line:84%
The rest of terms are 0,
because this will annihilate

00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:35.430 align:middle line:84%
the vacuum, and this
2a dagger together

00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:37.560 align:middle line:90%
will annihilate that vacuum.

00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:41.310 align:middle line:84%
So the only term not
vanishing is this term

00:57:41.310 --> 00:57:42.930 align:middle line:90%
combined with this term.

00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:45.920 align:middle line:90%
So you just get--

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:47.390 align:middle line:84%
and there's a
delta function when

00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:50.600 align:middle line:90%
you evaluate them between 0.

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:51.980 align:middle line:90%
And so you find--

00:57:51.980 --> 00:58:03.460 align:middle line:90%


00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:05.063 align:middle line:90%
And then you have --

00:58:05.063 --> 00:58:10.900 align:middle line:90%


00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:12.130 align:middle line:90%
t minus t prime.

00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:19.970 align:middle line:90%


00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:22.940 align:middle line:90%
So this is the object.

00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:26.480 align:middle line:90%


00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:30.650 align:middle line:84%
So we can do this
integral further,

00:58:30.650 --> 00:58:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and then we also rewrite this
in a slightly different form.

00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:40.740 align:middle line:84%
So you can also write this
as integrating-- so here,

00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:45.510 align:middle line:84%
omega k is on shell, so I can
also write it in a more general

00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:46.740 align:middle line:90%
form--

00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:48.780 align:middle line:90%
in the form like this--

00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:56.810 align:middle line:84%
2 pi theta k 0 delta k
squared plus m square

00:58:56.810 --> 00:59:04.360 align:middle line:90%
exponential i k dot minus x.

00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:07.870 align:middle line:84%
So in this form, the
k is unconstrained,

00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:11.800 align:middle line:84%
but I have a delta function
to enforce it on shell.

00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I put the theta k
0 to make it to be positive.

00:59:16.570 --> 00:59:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you can see that
this will lead to that.

00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:23.820 align:middle line:90%


00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:24.782 align:middle line:90%
You can see that.

00:59:24.782 --> 00:59:27.680 align:middle line:90%


00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:30.620 align:middle line:90%
And similarly, you can find--

00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:32.750 align:middle line:84%
similarly, you can find
the integral expressions

00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:42.290 align:middle line:84%
for G R, G A, and G F. I will
not give the expression here.

00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we will-- yeah, you can
easily find them yourself.

00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:55.060 align:middle line:90%
So let me just make one remark.

00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:57.650 align:middle line:90%


00:59:57.650 --> 01:00:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So you can now actually
calculate this object.

01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:02.700 align:middle line:90%


01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's
calculate this object.

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Remember earlier, we say
this object is the overlap

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:13.050 align:middle line:90%
between x and x prime.

01:00:13.050 --> 01:00:17.640 align:middle line:84%
So let's see in what sense
this is like a delta function.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:20.280 align:middle line:84%
In this sense, it's like
a delta function when

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.650 align:middle line:90%
we say them to be equal time.

01:00:22.650 --> 01:00:27.600 align:middle line:84%
So now, note-- so let's
consider the equal time

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.545 align:middle line:90%
t equal to t prime.

01:00:28.545 --> 01:00:32.160 align:middle line:90%


01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.690 align:middle line:90%
So for t equal to t prime--

01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:36.380 align:middle line:90%


01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:39.800 align:middle line:84%
so the integral
becomes following--

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:43.685 align:middle line:84%
G plus x and x prime
just equal to--

01:00:43.685 --> 01:00:58.370 align:middle line:90%


01:00:58.370 --> 01:01:01.230 align:middle line:90%
just become this.

01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And this integral
clearly is non-zero.

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:09.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we said earlier,
this is not a localized state.

01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:14.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is equal to
this x and x prime.

01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:17.570 align:middle line:84%
So this is non-zero as
equal to, and so this is not

01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:20.580 align:middle line:90%
a localized state.

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this is
not proportional

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:26.520 align:middle line:84%
to a delta function
if the thing is here.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.020 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
this factor, then

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:31.870 align:middle line:84%
it's a delta function,
but this one, it's not.

01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:36.000 align:middle line:84%
But you can nevertheless you
can calculate this integral

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:36.500 align:middle line:90%
exactly.

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:41.010 align:middle line:90%


01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And also just
based on the here--

01:01:43.410 --> 01:01:46.093 align:middle line:84%
based on the
spherical symmetry--

01:01:46.093 --> 01:01:47.760 align:middle line:84%
rotational symmetry,
you can immediately

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:52.010 align:middle line:84%
see that only depend on
the distance between them.

01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Only-- so this G plus will only
be a G plus a function of r,

01:01:58.070 --> 01:02:02.150 align:middle line:84%
and r is the distance between
the-- yeah, just based

01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:04.220 align:middle line:84%
on symmetry, you can
easily convince yourself.

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:07.725 align:middle line:84%
And this only depends on
the distance between them

01:02:07.725 --> 01:02:09.350 align:middle line:84%
just from the symmetry
of the integral.

01:02:09.350 --> 01:02:09.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:02:09.850 --> 01:02:14.280 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So when we added
the 2 omega k [INAUDIBLE]??

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:20.090 align:middle line:90%


01:02:20.090 --> 01:02:24.665 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's for the--

01:02:24.665 --> 01:02:27.710 align:middle line:84%
for example, for
calculating the--

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:32.640 align:middle line:90%
you wan a, a dagger equal to 1.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, because that's the
normalization for the a dagger.

01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:40.040 align:middle line:90%


01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.118 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's a good question.

01:02:42.118 --> 01:02:43.160 align:middle line:90%
I forgot to mention that.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:46.470 align:middle line:90%


01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:49.010 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:51.870 align:middle line:84%
So this object at
t equal to 0 only

01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:53.670 align:middle line:84%
depends on the
distance between them,

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:56.580 align:middle line:84%
because this is a spherical
integral because this one only

01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:58.590 align:middle line:90%
depends on the magnitude of k.

01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And then this is just a
standard Fourier transform.

01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:07.855 align:middle line:84%
So now, you can just evaluate
this integral explicitly.

01:03:07.855 --> 01:03:09.820 align:middle line:90%
I urge you to do it yourself.

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you can show this
is actually proportional--

01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:16.610 align:middle line:84%
you can actually evaluate
this using Bessel function.

01:03:16.610 --> 01:03:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So this gives you a
modified Bessel function--

01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:22.720 align:middle line:90%
K0 times m r.

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:25.070 align:middle line:90%
So do any of you--

01:03:25.070 --> 01:03:26.975 align:middle line:84%
are any of you expert
of Bessel function?

01:03:26.975 --> 01:03:30.492 align:middle line:90%


01:03:30.492 --> 01:03:32.325 align:middle line:84%
So do you know the
behavior of this function

01:03:32.325 --> 01:03:34.050 align:middle line:90%
for when r is large.

01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:34.878 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: Goes to 0.

01:03:34.878 --> 01:03:42.290 align:middle line:90%


01:03:42.290 --> 01:03:43.540 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it does to 0.

01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:46.625 align:middle line:84%
That's a good intuition, but
it goes to 0 in what way?

01:03:46.625 --> 01:03:49.150 align:middle line:90%


01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:51.970 align:middle line:90%
Actually, exponentially.

01:03:51.970 --> 01:03:55.720 align:middle line:84%
So it actually goes to
exponential minus mr,

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:57.280 align:middle line:90%
so for r large.

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:01.150 align:middle line:90%
For m r greater than 1.

01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can see in
what sense this is

01:04:03.310 --> 01:04:06.570 align:middle line:90%
approximately localized state.

01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:11.480 align:middle line:84%
You see this is
not 0, but this is

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.010 align:middle line:90%
pretty small at large distance.

01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:17.060 align:middle line:84%
So at distance r, it's
much greater than 1 over m.

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:35.560 align:middle line:90%


01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So when r is much
greater than 1 of m--

01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:42.295 align:middle line:84%
so that object is very small,
so this exponential is small.

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:51.710 align:middle line:90%


01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:54.500 align:middle line:84%
So this tells you that
even though this is not

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:57.830 align:middle line:84%
a perfectly
localized state, this

01:04:57.830 --> 01:05:05.480 align:middle line:84%
is localized to the
distance of 1 over m.

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:09.620 align:middle line:84%
So if these two points
are separated more than 1

01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:13.610 align:middle line:84%
over m, and then the
overlap becomes very small.

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:15.360 align:middle line:90%
And so this is--

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:21.690 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so sometimes,
we call this xi.

01:05:21.690 --> 01:05:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And then can in
condensed matter--

01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:27.210 align:middle line:84%
language which, when you
interpret this as a correlation

01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:29.060 align:middle line:90%
function--

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:33.000 align:middle line:84%
which the correlation between
the x and the phi x prime--

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.040 align:middle line:84%
and then this is also called
the correlation length.

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.120 align:middle line:90%
So when the phi--

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:40.640 align:middle line:90%
the distance beyond 1 over m--

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:45.440 align:middle line:84%
or beyond this xi and then
the phi no longer correlated.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:49.150 align:middle line:90%


01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:51.460 align:middle line:84%
So this a sense-- this is
approximately localized

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:55.030 align:middle line:84%
object, and it's essentially
the Compton wavelength

01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:56.857 align:middle line:90%
of the particle.

01:05:56.857 --> 01:05:58.690 align:middle line:84%
It's the Compton
wavelength of the particle.

01:05:58.690 --> 01:06:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And once you go outside
the Compton wavelength

01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:05.890 align:middle line:84%
of the particle, and then the
overlap becomes very small.

01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:09.055 align:middle line:84%
So this makes perfect
physical sense.

01:06:09.055 --> 01:06:10.870 align:middle line:90%
It makes perfect physical sense.

01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:13.650 align:middle line:90%


01:06:13.650 --> 01:06:15.473 align:middle line:90%
There was a hand?

01:06:15.473 --> 01:06:17.640 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Yeah, I had a
question, but then I realized

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.110 align:middle line:90%
that my thinking was wrong.

01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:20.030 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: OK, good.

01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:29.370 align:middle line:90%


01:06:29.370 --> 01:06:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this is
just [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:32.655 align:middle line:90%
of what we said earlier.

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:37.440 align:middle line:90%


01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:40.560 align:middle line:84%
So you can similarly get such
kind of integral expression

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:43.830 align:middle line:90%
for those things.

01:06:43.830 --> 01:06:48.510 align:middle line:84%
But rather than-- the coordinate
space expression is actually

01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:51.540 align:middle line:84%
often-- will be often-- actually
lead to the expression momentum

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:52.590 align:middle line:90%
space.

01:06:52.590 --> 01:06:56.940 align:middle line:90%
So it often leads there.

01:06:56.940 --> 01:07:12.860 align:middle line:84%
So often-- in the future, we'll
often lead the expressions

01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:13.800 align:middle line:90%
momentum space.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:21.010 align:middle line:90%


01:07:21.010 --> 01:07:23.230 align:middle line:84%
So we can just consider
the Fourier transform.

01:07:23.230 --> 01:07:26.520 align:middle line:90%


01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So here is the convention
of the Fourier transform.

01:07:30.310 --> 01:07:35.850 align:middle line:84%
So dx-- so any object
or function of x--

01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:42.570 align:middle line:84%
again, this is a four
vector, and the minus i k x.

01:07:42.570 --> 01:07:45.660 align:middle line:84%
So I use the same
notation, G, to denote

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:48.120 align:middle line:84%
its Fourier transform,
and distinguish them

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:52.110 align:middle line:84%
only by k and x because it's
just annoying to always put

01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:56.740 align:middle line:90%
some tilde above it.

01:07:56.740 --> 01:08:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And the inverse transformation
would be the G x x prime.

01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:07.480 align:middle line:84%
So you see here explicitly--
yeah, there, we already

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:13.970 align:middle line:84%
see explicitly that is only the
function of their separations.

01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And then if you use the
symmetry here further,

01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:18.370 align:middle line:90%
then you see the distances.

01:08:18.370 --> 01:08:25.324 align:middle line:84%
So we can also just write
this in terms of the--

01:08:25.324 --> 01:08:32.170 align:middle line:84%
this is i k x x
minus x prime G k.

01:08:32.170 --> 01:08:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So this is our convention
for the Fourier transform.

01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:41.670 align:middle line:84%
So from here, if you just
look at this expression

01:08:41.670 --> 01:08:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and compare with
this expression,

01:08:43.950 --> 01:08:47.790 align:middle line:84%
and then immediately we conclude
for this Whiteman function

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:56.359 align:middle line:84%
G plus, k is just given by 2
pi theta k 0 delta function

01:08:56.359 --> 01:08:57.874 align:middle line:90%
k squared plus m squared.

01:08:57.874 --> 01:09:02.330 align:middle line:90%


01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:06.660 align:middle line:84%
So this is the expression
for the G plus.

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:07.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:12.488 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So this
localization is [INAUDIBLE],,

01:09:12.488 --> 01:09:14.280 align:middle line:84%
which is greater for
higher momentum, so is

01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:16.363 align:middle line:84%
this a manifestation of
the uncertainty principle?

01:09:16.363 --> 01:09:19.319 align:middle line:90%


01:09:19.319 --> 01:09:22.050 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, this is a--

01:09:22.050 --> 01:09:24.930 align:middle line:84%
so here, this is, in some sense,
the uncertainty principle.

01:09:24.930 --> 01:09:29.710 align:middle line:84%
This-- here, we just
consider in the vacuum state,

01:09:29.710 --> 01:09:32.069 align:middle line:90%
so there's not--

01:09:32.069 --> 01:09:35.149 align:middle line:84%
the state itself does
not have any energy.

01:09:35.149 --> 01:09:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And so this is just
the Compton wavelength

01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:40.020 align:middle line:90%
of the particle itself.

01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:43.689 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like a
static Compton wavelength.

01:09:43.689 --> 01:09:50.040 align:middle line:90%


01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:50.760 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:51.479 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:53.771 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: If this is the vacuum
state, then what does it

01:09:53.771 --> 01:09:55.720 align:middle line:90%
mean to be [INAUDIBLE]?

01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:01.120 align:middle line:90%


01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.750 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but still
you have fluctuations.

01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:05.310 align:middle line:90%
This is quantum mechanics.

01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:10.020 align:middle line:90%


01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, for example, you can
calculate an analogous object

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.760 align:middle line:90%
for the harmonic oscillator.

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.580 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
harmonic oscillator,

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:21.300 align:middle line:84%
the analogous object
is this object,

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:24.990 align:middle line:84%
and you can also calculate
this non-zero just because

01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:26.160 align:middle line:90%
of the fluctuations.

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:29.570 align:middle line:90%


01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:30.560 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.800 align:middle line:90%


01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.220 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:43.480 align:middle line:84%
So this is the expression
for the G plus.

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And for those object, we can
get a momentum space expression

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:52.700 align:middle line:84%
by going through
the same procedure.

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Just plug them in, labor
through, and then write

01:10:57.590 --> 01:11:00.890 align:middle line:84%
the final answer in this
four momentum integral form,

01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:03.020 align:middle line:84%
and then you just
read the answer.

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:05.060 align:middle line:84%
For them, we can
do the same thing.

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:08.350 align:middle line:90%
But it's actually much easier.

01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Instead of going
through that procedure

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.090 align:middle line:84%
to calculate those quantities,
it's actually much easier

01:11:13.090 --> 01:11:20.310 align:middle line:84%
to start from here, because
they satisfy these equations.

01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:23.830 align:middle line:90%
So let me call this star.

01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So to find G F k the
same with G R, A k,

01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:49.165 align:middle line:84%
it's actually
easier to use star.

01:11:49.165 --> 01:11:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately-- so now, if
you look at this equation--

01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:59.350 align:middle line:90%


01:11:59.350 --> 01:12:02.730 align:middle line:84%
if we look at this
equation, then

01:12:02.730 --> 01:12:04.480 align:middle line:84%
let's use Fourier
transform on both sides.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:20.220 align:middle line:90%


01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:22.680 align:middle line:84%
We do a Fourier
transform on both sides.

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So the left-hand
side, the partial--

01:12:26.150 --> 01:12:28.010 align:middle line:84%
each derivative
just gives you a k.

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:30.900 align:middle line:84%
So this is the standard
rule for Fourier transform.

01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And so here, you just get
k squared plus m squared.

01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And let me just call it
G, so denote any of them,

01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:42.260 align:middle line:90%
equal to minus i.

01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Because the
right-hand side, when

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:46.100 align:middle line:84%
you do a Fourier transform,
it just becomes one.

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:47.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a delta function.

01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:51.840 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can immediately
write down the expression

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:52.700 align:middle line:90%
in momentum space.

01:12:52.700 --> 01:13:03.090 align:middle line:90%


01:13:03.090 --> 01:13:06.460 align:middle line:84%
But now, you see
we have a problem.

01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:10.240 align:middle line:90%
So what problem do we have?

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:11.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:13:11.290 --> 01:13:14.050 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: When you have k squared
equals negative m squared

01:13:14.050 --> 01:13:15.850 align:middle line:90%
it's like a singularity.

01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:16.930 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Good.

01:13:16.930 --> 01:13:19.338 align:middle line:90%
Well, we have a lot of problems.

01:13:19.338 --> 01:13:20.630 align:middle line:90%
So this is one of the problems.

01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:21.635 align:middle line:90%
We have another problem.

01:13:21.635 --> 01:13:22.565 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:23.960 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: Is this on shell?

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:24.593 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Hmm?

01:13:24.593 --> 01:13:26.958 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:26.958 --> 01:13:29.800 align:middle line:90%


01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:31.780 align:middle line:84%
PROFESSOR: So k is not
on shell, because when

01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:36.910 align:middle line:84%
we do a Fourier transform,
it's for the general k.

01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:39.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's defined
for the general k.

01:13:39.370 --> 01:13:40.990 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, for the on
shell value of k,

01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:43.165 align:middle line:84%
then you will have
a singular behavior.

01:13:43.165 --> 01:13:45.680 align:middle line:90%


01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:48.380 align:middle line:84%
But for the-- but we still
have another problem.

01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:57.410 align:middle line:90%


01:13:57.410 --> 01:13:58.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:00.910 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: They're not
supposed to be complex?

01:14:00.910 --> 01:14:02.230 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it is complex.

01:14:02.230 --> 01:14:04.580 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:06.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that aspect is OK.

01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:07.445 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so since--

01:14:07.445 --> 01:14:08.810 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So you see here, we have defined
the three different functions,

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:19.281 align:middle line:84%
but there, how many
solutions we have?

01:14:19.281 --> 01:14:20.160 align:middle line:90%
We only have one.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:22.380 align:middle line:84%
We have unique
solution seems like.

01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:24.635 align:middle line:90%
Then we have a problem.

01:14:24.635 --> 01:14:26.010 align:middle line:84%
It seems like--
that seems to say

01:14:26.010 --> 01:14:27.218 align:middle line:90%
all these three are the same.

01:14:27.218 --> 01:14:31.080 align:middle line:84%
But if you calculate them
going through this theta

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:35.310 align:middle line:84%
function [INAUDIBLE],,
they are not the same.

01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:37.670 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out these
two problems are related.

01:14:37.670 --> 01:14:40.205 align:middle line:90%


01:14:40.205 --> 01:14:43.320 align:middle line:84%
It turns out these two problems
are related because now,

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:47.790 align:middle line:84%
if you consider the coordinate
space expression, which

01:14:47.790 --> 01:14:50.145 align:middle line:84%
obtained by the Fourier
transform of this guy--

01:14:50.145 --> 01:15:01.070 align:middle line:90%


01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:04.180 align:middle line:84%
again, by Fourier
transform of this guy--

01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:12.410 align:middle line:84%
so in the-- so if you write
down explicitly 1 over k squared

01:15:12.410 --> 01:15:14.300 align:middle line:90%
plus--

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:17.670 align:middle line:84%
so 1 over k squared
plus m squared,

01:15:17.670 --> 01:15:19.020 align:middle line:90%
if we write it explicitly.

01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:24.140 align:middle line:84%
So this is 1 over minus omega
squared plus k squared plus m

01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:25.670 align:middle line:90%
squared--

01:15:25.670 --> 01:15:26.910 align:middle line:90%
write it explicitly.

01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And then this is
equal to minus omega

01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:33.380 align:middle line:90%
squared plus omega k squared.

01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:35.015 align:middle line:84%
So this is just the
omega k squared.

01:15:35.015 --> 01:15:37.970 align:middle line:90%


01:15:37.970 --> 01:15:43.040 align:middle line:84%
So as you said, this actually
has a singularity when omega

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.040 align:middle line:90%
equal to plus minus omega k.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:49.330 align:middle line:84%
When you satisfy this
on shell condition.

01:15:49.330 --> 01:15:53.680 align:middle line:84%
But this singularity is actually
along the integration contour

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:54.190 align:middle line:90%
of omega.

01:15:54.190 --> 01:15:56.850 align:middle line:90%


01:15:56.850 --> 01:16:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Because in these four integrals
is given by d omega dk.

01:16:03.190 --> 01:16:06.730 align:middle line:84%
So the omega-- so this
from minus infinity

01:16:06.730 --> 01:16:08.790 align:middle line:90%
to plus infinity.

01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And these two singularities
are the real value of omega.

01:16:12.330 --> 01:16:18.080 align:middle line:84%
So they actually-- so if
you look at omega axis--

01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:21.190 align:middle line:84%
so at these two points,
actually, they become singular.

01:16:21.190 --> 01:16:25.730 align:middle line:90%
The integrand is singular.

01:16:25.730 --> 01:16:29.340 align:middle line:84%
So the integral is
actually not well-defined.

01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:31.620 align:middle line:84%
So the integral is
not well-defined.

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:35.020 align:middle line:84%
So in order to
define the integral--

01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:38.320 align:middle line:84%
in order to define
this omega integral,

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:45.250 align:middle line:84%
then we have to do your standard
trick in complex analysis.

01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:47.690 align:middle line:90%
So what is that trick?

01:16:47.690 --> 01:16:48.470 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:50.120 align:middle line:90%
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:51.120 align:middle line:90%
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:55.150 align:middle line:90%
You go around the singularity.

01:16:55.150 --> 01:16:58.940 align:middle line:84%
So now, you go to
the complex plane--

01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:00.290 align:middle line:90%
complex omega plane.

01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:02.930 align:middle line:90%
So now this is a real omega.

01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:04.400 align:middle line:90%
This is imaginary omega.

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:05.960 align:middle line:84%
You go to the
complex omega plane.

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, the integration constant
is along the real axis.

01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And now, you have four
different choices.

01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:19.040 align:middle line:84%
You can either go up or going
down for each one of them.

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And now you have four
different choices.

01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And this 3 equals 1 into
three choices of them.

01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Then there's a fourth one,
which is not frequently used,

01:17:28.530 --> 01:17:30.920 align:middle line:84%
so we normally don't
give them a name.

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth one, sometimes,
we call them G F tilde.

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:38.150 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- anyway, so there are
four different choices of going

01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:41.540 align:middle line:84%
around the singularity,
and then that gives you

01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:44.930 align:middle line:90%
four possible solutions.

01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:47.421 align:middle line:90%
And then that gives you the--

01:17:47.421 --> 01:17:51.300 align:middle line:90%


01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:54.540 align:middle line:84%
yeah, so now let's
talk about the G R--

01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:56.500 align:middle line:90%
do them one by one.

01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:59.430 align:middle line:90%
So for G R--

01:17:59.430 --> 01:18:03.120 align:middle line:84%
so remember, G R
is defined to be

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:06.360 align:middle line:84%
when theta t greater
than t prime,

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:10.420 align:middle line:84%
G R should be proportional
to t, to t minus t prime.

01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:16.580 align:middle line:84%
So that means this should
be 0 for t minus t prime

01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:17.390 align:middle line:90%
smaller than 0.

01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:19.910 align:middle line:90%


01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:25.090 align:middle line:84%
This should be 0 for t minus
t prime smaller than 0.

01:18:25.090 --> 01:18:30.370 align:middle line:84%
So how do we achieve that
by going around the poles?

01:18:30.370 --> 01:18:35.500 align:middle line:84%
So remember, in this
integral, it's a peice minus--

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:41.180 align:middle line:84%
the omega dependent piece is
minus i omega t minus t prime.

01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:43.970 align:middle line:84%
So when t minus t
prime smaller than 0.

01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:48.630 align:middle line:84%
If you want to do this integral
using contour integration,

01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:50.810 align:middle line:90%
then you can close--

01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:53.353 align:middle line:84%
so this is smaller than 0,
and then this is positive.

01:18:53.353 --> 01:18:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And then you can close the
contour in the upper half

01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:56.960 align:middle line:90%
plane.

01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:59.330 align:middle line:84%
You can close the contour
in the upper half plane.

01:18:59.330 --> 01:19:02.090 align:middle line:84%
In order for this
to be identically 0,

01:19:02.090 --> 01:19:04.550 align:middle line:84%
you need your
integration-- counter

01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:06.830 align:middle line:90%
don't enclose any singularity.

01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:11.690 align:middle line:84%
So that means for
the retarded, you

01:19:11.690 --> 01:19:14.360 align:middle line:84%
need to going around the
singularity along which

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:15.020 align:middle line:90%
direction?

01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:18.150 align:middle line:90%


01:19:18.150 --> 01:19:19.826 align:middle line:90%
We only have one minute left.

01:19:19.826 --> 01:19:22.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:24.550 align:middle line:84%
For it to be 0, when
you integrate-- so

01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:27.940 align:middle line:84%
you want to close in
the upper half plane.

01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:31.030 align:middle line:84%
You want to close it
because the t minus t prime

01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:34.110 align:middle line:84%
is smaller than 0, and then this
is positive i, and the omega

01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:35.110 align:middle line:90%
in the upper half plane.

01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:37.490 align:middle line:90%
This is a decay exponential.

01:19:37.490 --> 01:19:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And so you wonder, there's no
singularity inside the contour,

01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and then you want to go around
the singularity this way.

01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:49.400 align:middle line:90%
Going above the singularity.

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:51.920 align:middle line:84%
When you're going above
the singularity, and then

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:53.970 align:middle line:90%
this contour don't include--

01:19:53.970 --> 01:19:57.350 align:middle line:90%
and then within this contour--

01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:58.730 align:middle line:90%
and then there's no singularity.

01:19:58.730 --> 01:20:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Then, this is identically
0 from the Cauchy theorem.

01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:04.820 align:middle line:84%
So it tells you that for
the retarded Green function,

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:08.640 align:middle line:90%
you need the contour like that.

01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:15.450 align:middle line:90%
So similarly, for the advanced--

01:20:15.450 --> 01:20:19.090 align:middle line:84%
because the advanced, we
just change the direction.

01:20:19.090 --> 01:20:21.300 align:middle line:90%
So this is for the retarded.

01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:26.200 align:middle line:84%
For the advanced,
it's proportional to t

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:26.898 align:middle line:90%
minus t prime.

01:20:26.898 --> 01:20:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Then you just go in
the opposite direction.

01:20:28.690 --> 01:20:31.870 align:middle line:90%


01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:35.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is for the
retarded-- for the advanced.

01:20:35.410 --> 01:20:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally, if we want
to do it for the Feynman--

01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:43.800 align:middle line:84%
and then you choose
one of them going up

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:44.940 align:middle line:90%
and one of them going down.

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:48.030 align:middle line:84%
I always forget which one
going up, which one going down.

01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so actually, this one
you go down, and this one you

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.240 align:middle line:90%
go up.

01:20:54.240 --> 01:21:04.140 align:middle line:84%
So this is for the Feynman for
the G F. That's all for today.

01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:08.000 align:middle line:90%
